PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This Section prescribes the accounting treatment for employee future benefits provided by a not-for-profit organization.
Except as otherwise provided for in this Section, a not-for-profit organization applies EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS, Section 3462 in Part II of the Handbook.
DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS — RECOGNITION AND PRESENTATION OF REMEASUREMENTS AND OTHER ITEMS
.02
A not-for-profit organization shall determine the amount of remeasurements and other items for the period in accordance with EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS, paragraphs 3462.085-.090 in Part II of the Handbook.
Remeasurements and other items shall be:
recognized directly in net assets in the statement of financial position rather than in the statement of operations; and
presented as a separately identified line item in the statement of changes in net assets.
.03
Remeasurements and other items are not reclassified to the statement of operations in a subsequent period.
EFFECTIVE DATE AND TRANSITION
.04
Except as specified in paragraph 3463.04A, a not-for-profit organization applies this Section for annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2014.
Earlier application is permitted, but only for all of a not-for-profit organization's benefit plans.
Amendments to EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS, paragraphs 3462.029, 3462.029AB, 3462.029D, 3462.032, 3462.034, 3462.046, 3462.062 and 3462.116-.117 in Part II of the Handbook, and new paragraphs 3462.029AA and 3462.029AC, apply to annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
A not-for-profit organization applies these amendments as specified in paragraphs 3463.08-.10.
Earlier application is permitted, but only for all of a not-for-profit organization's defined benefit plans.
.04B
A not-for-profit organization may only apply paragraphs 3463.05-.07 when preparing its annual financial statements relating to the first fiscal year in which Section 3463 is effective.
.05
A not-for-profit organization applies this Section retrospectively, in accordance with ACCOUNTING CHANGES, Section 1506 in Part II of the Handbook, except as specified in paragraphs 3463.06-.07.
.06
When a not-for-profit organization includes employee benefit costs in the carrying amount of assets, such as inventories or tangible capital assets, it need not restate the carrying amount of those assets at the date of application of this Section.
.07
For example, a not-for-profit organization might previously have deferred and amortized actuarial gains and losses, and past service costs, for its defined benefit plans, or may have decided to change from using an accounting valuation to a funding valuation to measure its defined benefit obligation.
Determine the fair value of plan assets as of the date of the statement of financial position for the year in which this Section is first applied in accordance with paragraphs 3462.065-.066.
Allocate this amount proportionately such that twelve months of costs are allocated to the statement of operations for the current year, and adjust opening net assets for the earliest prior year presented by any remainder.
Guidance on the transitional approach for the measurement date provisions described in (d)-(f) above is provided in the Illustrative Example.
.08
For those defined benefit plans specified in EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS, paragraph 3462.029 in Part II of the Handbook, for which the defined benefit obligation is measured using a funding valuation, a not-for-profit organization applies new paragraph 3462.029AC and the amendments to paragraph 3462.029D, at the beginning of the first fiscal year in which these amendments are first applied.
A not-for-profit organization applies these amendments as follows:
The cumulative effect of applying the amendments is recorded in opening net assets at the date that the amendments are first applied.
In this case, the financial statements of prior periods presented for comparative purposes are not restated.
The effect of applying the amendments is recorded in the statement of changes in net assets in the year that such a funding valuation is completed.
In this case, there is no adjustment to opening net assets.
.09
For those defined benefit plans specified in EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS, new paragraph 3462.029AA in Part II of the Handbook, a not-for-profit organization applies new paragraph 3462.029AA at the beginning of the first fiscal year in which these amendments are first applied.
.10
When a not-for-profit organization includes employee benefit costs in the carrying amount of assets, such as inventories or tangible capital assets, it need not restate the carrying amount of those assets at the date that the amendments specified in paragraph 3463.04A are first applied.
ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE
APPLICATION OF THE TRANSITIONAL APPROACH FOR THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS
This material is illustrative only.
This example illustrates how the accounting treatment specified in paragraphs 3463.07(d)-(f) might be applied in particular situations.
Matters of principle relating to particular situations should be decided in the context of this Section.

Illustrative examples
This Section establishes standards for:
recognizing and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and specified contracts to buy or sell non-financial items;
the classification of financial instruments, from the perspective of the issuer, between liabilities and equity;
the classification of related interest, dividends, losses and gains;
the circumstances in which financial assets and financial liabilities are offset;
when and how hedge accounting may be applied; and
disclosures about financial assets and financial liabilities.
Common examples of financial instruments include:
cash;
demand and fixed-term deposits;
commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, treasury notes and bills;
accounts, notes and loans receivable and payable;
bonds and similar debt instruments, both issued and held as investments;
common and preferred shares and similar equity instruments, both issued and held as investments; and
options, warrants, futures contracts, forward contracts, and swaps.
An enterprise applies this Section to all financial instruments except the following:
leases (see LEASES, Section 3065), although Appendix B applies to transfers of lease receivables;
employer's rights and obligations for employee future benefits and related plan assets (see EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS, Section 3462);
insurance contracts, including the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy;
investments held by an investment company that are accounted for at fair value in accordance with ACCOUNTING GUIDELINE AcG-18, Investment Companies, although the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 3856.37-.54 apply to an investment company;
contracts and obligations for stock-based compensation to employees and stock-based payments to non-employees (see STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER STOCK-BASED PAYMENTS, Section 3870);
guarantees, other than guarantees that replace financial liabilities as described in paragraph 3856.A58 (see also ACCOUNTING GUIDELINE AcG-14, Disclosure of Guarantees);
contracts based on revenues of a party to the contract;
loan commitments (see CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, Section 3280, and CONTINGENCIES, Section 3290);
contractual arrangements that prevent sale treatment (for example, an option to repurchase transferred receivables); and
contracts issued by an acquirer (but not the seller) for contingent consideration in a business combination until such time as the contingency is resolved (see BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, paragraphs 1582.41-.42).
This exception applies only to the acquirer (the enterprise that is accounting for the combination) and not to the seller.
This Section does not apply to:
contracts to buy or sell non-financial items except for:
exchange-traded futures contracts; and
(ii)
contracts that are designated in a qualifying hedging relationship in accordance with paragraphs 3856.30-.36; and
non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.
Not-for-profit organizations do not apply paragraphs 3856.19AA, 3856.28A, 3856.42A, 3856.47A, 3856.A37A-.A37C and 3856.A60A.
DEFINITIONS
The following terms are used in this Section with the meanings specified:
(bb)The cost method is a basis of accounting for financial instruments whereby the instrument is initially recorded at cost; earnings from such instruments are recognized only to the extent received or receivable.
its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, a credit rating or credit index, or other variable (sometimes called the "underlying"), provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract;
it requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors; and
(da)An economic interest in another not-for-profit organization exists if:
the other organization holds resources that must be used to produce revenue or provide services for the reporting organization; or
the reporting organization is responsible for the liabilities of the other organization.
(ea)Exchange amount is the amount of consideration paid or received as established and agreed to by related parties.
Financing fees, sometimes referred to as fees in lieu of interest, loan fees or financing costs, include:
fees charged to originate, arrange or syndicate a loan or debt financing;
commitment, standby and guarantee fees; and
(iii) refinancing, restructuring and renegotiation fees.
Financing fees may be refundable or non-refundable.
Financing fees do not include transaction costs.
cash;
a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another party;
(iii) a contractual right to exchange financial instruments with another party under conditions that are potentially favourable; or
(iv) an equity instrument of another enterprise.
The cost incurred by an enterprise to purchase a right to reacquire its own equity instruments from another party is a deduction from its equity, not a financial asset.
to deliver cash or another financial asset to another party; or
to exchange financial instruments with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the enterprise.
a derivative offsetting a risk exposure identified in the hedged item; or
a non-derivative financial asset or a non-derivative financial liability offsetting the foreign currency risk exposure in the net investment in a self-sustaining foreign operation.
Insurance contracts include any contract based on climatic, geological or other physical variables.
(oa)Observable inputs are developed using market data, such as publicly available information about actual events or transactions, and reflect the assumptions that knowledgeable, willing parties that are under no compulsion to act would use when valuing the asset or liability.
Examples of markets in which inputs might be observable for financial assets or financial liabilities include exchange markets, dealer markets, brokered markets and principal-to-principal markets.
(ob)Related parties exist when one party has the ability to exercise, directly or indirectly, control, joint control or significant influence over the other.
Two or more parties are related when they are subject to common control, joint control or common significant influence.
Two not-for-profit organizations are related parties if one has an economic interest in the other.
Related parties also include management and immediate family members (see RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, paragraph 3840.04 or DISCLOSURE OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS BY NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, paragraph 4460.04 in Part III of the Handbook, as applicable).
The parties to the transaction are related prior to the transaction.
When the relationship arises as a result of the transaction, the transaction is not one between related parties.
An incremental cost is one that would not have been incurred if the enterprise had not acquired, issued or disposed of the financial instrument.
Transaction costs include expenditures such as legal fees, reimbursement of the lender's administrative costs and appraisal costs associated with a loan.
Transaction costs do not include financing fees, debt premiums or discounts.
An enterprise shall recognize a financial asset or a financial liability when the enterprise becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
(Paragraphs 3856.A7A and 3856.A8K provide related application guidance.)
Except as specified in this Section, transaction costs shall be recognized in net income in the period incurred.
Except as specified in paragraph 3856.09A, when a financial asset is originated or acquired or a financial liability is issued or assumed in an arm's length transaction, an enterprise shall measure it at its fair value adjusted by, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability that will not be measured subsequently at fair value, financing fees and transaction costs that are directly attributable to its origination, acquisition, issuance or assumption.
(Paragraphs 3856.A8 and 3856.A9-.A13 provide related application guidance.) [Former paragraph 3856.07 retained in Archived Pronouncements.]
For the purpose of this Section, parties whose sole relationship with the enterprise is in the capacity of management, as defined in RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, paragraph 3840.04(d) or DISCLOSURE OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS BY NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, paragraph 4460.04(e), as an individual, group or by contract, and members of the immediate family of any individual to which this paragraph applies, are deemed to be unrelated third parties.
The requirements of paragraph 3856.07 apply to transactions with such parties.
Except as specified in paragraphs 3856.08C-.08D and 3856.09A, when a financial asset is originated or acquired or a financial liability is issued or assumed in a related party transaction, an enterprise shall initially measure it at cost.
The cost of a financial instrument in a related party transaction shall depend on whether the instrument has repayment terms.
When the financial asset originated or acquired or the financial liability issued or assumed:
does not have repayment terms, the cost of the instrument shall be determined using the consideration transferred or received by the enterprise in the transaction (see paragraph 3856.08A).
As required by paragraph 3856.08(b), when the consideration transferred by the enterprise in the transaction:
is an asset or liability that does not have repayment terms, the cost of the financial asset originated or acquired or the financial liability issued or assumed is the carrying or exchange amount of the consideration transferred or received (see paragraph 3856.08B).
(Paragraph 3856.A8C provides related application guidance.)
.08B
As required by paragraph 3856.08A(b), the cost of a financial asset originated or acquired or financial liability issued or assumed in a related party transaction is the exchange amount of the consideration transferred or received when:
the transaction is in the normal course of operations; or
the transaction is not in the normal course of operations and:
the transaction is a monetary transaction or a non-monetary transaction that has commercial substance;
the change in the ownership interests in the related financial item transferred is substantive; and
(iii) the amount of consideration paid or received is established and agreed to by related parties and is supported by independent evidence.
Otherwise, the cost of the financial asset originated or acquired or the financial liability issued or assumed in a related party transaction is the carrying amount of the consideration transferred or received.
(Paragraphs 3856.A8D-A8I provide related application guidance.)
.08C
An enterprise shall initially measure the following financial instruments originated or acquired or issued or assumed in a related party transaction at fair value without any adjustments:
investments in equity instruments that are quoted in an active market;
debt instruments that are quoted in an active market;
debt instruments when the inputs significant to the determination of the fair value of the instrument are observable, either directly or indirectly (Paragraph 3856.A8J provides related application guidance.); and
derivative contracts.
(Paragraphs 3856.A9-.A10 provide related application guidance.)
.08D
Except for financial instruments to which paragraph 3856.14A applies, an enterprise shall not initially measure the variable or contingent portion of a related party financial instrument.
Instead, the enterprise shall disclose the terms of the instrument and remeasure the financial asset or financial liability at fair value when the contingency or variability is resolved, with any gain or loss recognized in net income.
Except for retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement to which paragraph 3856.23 applies, on initial measurement, when a related party transaction includes a financial instrument and is in the normal course of operations, or is not in the normal course of operations and:
the change in the ownership interests in the items transferred is substantive; and
the transaction amounts for each of the elements in the transaction are supported by independent evidence,
any gain or loss resulting from initial recognition shall be included in net income, unless another Section requires alternative treatment.
Otherwise, any difference resulting from the transaction shall be included in equity.
(Paragraph 3856.09 moved and renumbered 3856.07A)
An enterprise shall initially measure retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement that are classified as:
equity in accordance with paragraph 3856.23, at their par, stated or assigned value; or
a financial liability in accordance with paragraph 3856.23, at their redemption amount.
(paragraph 3856.10 moved and renumbered 3856.06A)
(Paragraph 3856.A13A provides related application guidance.)
.11
Except for those financial instruments for which paragraphs 3856.14-.14A or 3856.15A apply, at each reporting date, an enterprise shall subsequently measure a financial instrument based on how it initially measured the instrument.
If the enterprise initially measured the financial instrument at:
fair value, it shall subsequently measure the instrument as follows:
investments in equity instruments that are quoted in an active market and derivative contracts at fair value in accordance with paragraph 3856.12;
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value, if the enterprise elects that fair value measurement shall apply in accordance with paragraphs 3856.13 or 3856.13A;
(iii)investments in equity instruments not quoted in an active market, when originated or acquired in an arm's length transaction, at cost less any reduction for impairment;
(iv)all other financial assets at amortized cost; and
financial liabilities at amortized cost; or
cost, it shall subsequently measure the instrument using the cost method less any reduction for impairment.
.12
An enterprise shall subsequently measure the following financial instruments at fair value without any adjustment for transaction costs it may incur on sale or other disposal:
investments in equity instruments that are quoted in an active market (see paragraphs 3856.A9-.A11); and
derivative contracts other than:
derivatives that are designated in a qualifying hedging relationship in accordance with paragraphs 3856.30-.36 or FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, paragraph 1651.39; and
derivatives that are linked to, and must be settled by delivery of, equity instruments of another enterprise whose fair value cannot be readily determined.
Changes in fair value shall be recognized in net income in the period incurred.
An enterprise discontinues measuring an investment in an equity instrument of a related party at fair value when the instrument ceases to be quoted in an active market.
At each subsequent reporting date, the enterprise shall measure the instrument using the cost method in accordance with paragraph 3856.11(b).
The fair value of the instrument, immediately before the instrument ceases to be quoted in an active market, is its cost.
.13
Except for a financial instrument to which paragraph 3856.09A applies, an enterprise may elect to subsequently measure any financial asset originated or acquired or financial liability issued or assumed in an arm's length transaction, at fair value by designating that fair value measurement shall apply:
when the asset or liability is first recognized in accordance with this Section; or
for an investment in an equity instrument that was previously measured at fair value in accordance with paragraph 3856.12(a), when the instrument ceases to be quoted in an active market.
Any designation in accordance with this paragraph is irrevocable.
An enterprise may elect to subsequently measure debt instruments originated or acquired or issued or assumed in a related party transaction at fair value by designating that fair value measurement shall apply when the debt instrument is first recognized in accordance with this Section, and:
the debt instrument is quoted in an active market; or
the inputs significant to the determination of the fair value of the debt instrument are observable, either directly or indirectly.
.13B
An enterprise discontinues measuring a debt instrument:
originated or acquired in a related party transaction at fair value when the instrument ceases to be quoted in an active market and when inputs significant to the determination of the fair value of the instrument are no longer observable; or
issued or assumed in a related party transaction at fair value when inputs significant to the determination of the fair value of the instrument are no longer observable.
At each subsequent reporting date, the enterprise shall measure the instrument at amortized cost in accordance with paragraphs 3856.11(a)(iv) or 3856.11(a)(v).
The fair value of the instrument immediately before it ceases to be quoted in an active market or ceases to have inputs that are observable is the amount at which the instrument is recognized.
.14
The issuer of a financial liability that is indexed to a measure of the enterprise's financial performance or to changes in the value of the enterprise's equity shall account for the instrument as follows:
the liability is initially measured in accordance with paragraphs 3856.07 or 3856.08;
interest expense is calculated using the stated interest rate, plus or minus the amortization of any initial premium or discount; and
except as specified in paragraph 3856.14A, at each reporting date, the enterprise adjusts the carrying amount of the liability to the higher of:
the amortized cost of the debt; and
the amount that would be due at the balance sheet date if the formula determining the additional amount was applied at that date (the conversion or intrinsic value).
The amount of the adjustment in accordance with paragraph (c) above shall be recognized in net income and presented as a separate component of interest expense.
The issuer of a related party financial liability that is indexed to a measure of the enterprise's financial performance or to changes in the value of the enterprise's equity shall adjust the carrying amount of the liability, at each reporting date, to the higher of:
the cost of the debt; and
the amount that would be due at the balance sheet date if the formula determining the additional amount was applied at that date.
The amount of the adjustment in accordance with this paragraph shall be recognized in net income and presented as a separate component of interest expense.
.15
The issuer shall report distributions to holders of a financial instrument it classifies as an equity instrument directly in equity.
(Paragraphs 3856.A39-.A40 provide related application guidance.)
An enterprise shall subsequently measure retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement that are classified as:
.16
When there is an indication of impairment, an enterprise shall determine whether a significant adverse change has occurred during the period in the expected timing or amount of future cash flows from the financial asset or group of assets.
.17
Except as specified in paragraphs 3856.17A-.17B, when an enterprise identifies a significant adverse change in the expected timing or amount of future cash flows from a financial asset, or group of similar financial assets, it shall reduce the carrying amount of the asset, or group of assets, to the highest of the following:
the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated by holding the asset, or group of assets, discounted using a current market rate of interest appropriate to the asset, or group of assets;
the amount that could be realized by selling the asset, or group of assets, at the balance sheet date; and
the amount the enterprise expects to realize by exercising its right to any collateral held to secure repayment of the asset, or group of assets, net of all costs necessary to exercise those rights.
The carrying amount of the asset, or group of assets, shall be reduced directly or through the use of an allowance account.
The amount of the reduction shall be recognized as an impairment loss in net income.
For debt instruments originated or acquired in a related party transaction and initially measured at cost, an enterprise shall reduce the carrying amount of the asset, or group of similar assets, to the highest of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by holding the asset, or group of similar assets, excluding the interest and dividend payments of the instrument, and the amounts specified in paragraphs 3856.17(b)-(c).
.17B
For equity instruments originated or acquired in a related party transaction and initially measured at cost, an enterprise shall reduce the carrying amount of the asset, or group of similar assets, to the amount that could be realized by selling the asset, or group of similar assets, at the balance sheet date.
.18
Estimates of the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows from impaired financial assets reflect management's best judgment, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions, and take into account the range of possible outcomes.
Short-term receivables with no stated interest rate may be measured at the revised expected amount if the effect of discounting is immaterial.
.19
When the extent of impairment of a previously written-down asset, or group of assets, decreases and the decrease can be related to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized (such as a return to profitability of the customer or issuer), the previously recognized impairment loss shall be reversed to the extent of the improvement, directly or by adjusting the allowance account.
The adjusted carrying amount of the financial asset, or group of assets, shall be no greater than the amount that would have been reported at the date of the reversal had the impairment not been recognized previously.
The amount of the reversal shall be recognized in net income in the period the reversal occurs.
(Former paragraph 3856.19A moved and renumbered 3856.19C)
.19AA
Except as specified in paragraph 3856.19B, after assessing for and recognizing any impairment in accordance with paragraphs 3856.17A-.17B, forgiveness of all or part of a related party financial asset shall be recognized in:
equity, when the transaction that resulted in the origination or acquisition of the financial asset was not in the normal course of operations; or
net income when:
the transaction that resulted in the origination or acquisition of the financial asset was in the normal course of operations; or
it is impracticable to determine whether the forgiven related party financial asset was originated or was acquired in the normal course of operations or not in the normal course of operations.
A borrower accounts for the extinguishment of a financial liability issued in a transaction between related parties in accordance with paragraph 3856.28A.
(Paragraphs 3856.A21A and .A21B provide related application guidance.)
.19B
Not-for-profit organizations shall recognize the forgiveness of a related party financial asset in the statement of operations.
PRESENTATION
Income from investments subsequently measured at fair value or cost or using the cost method shall be separately presented on the face of the income statement.
.20
(Paragraphs 3856.A22-.A38 provide related application guidance.)
.21
The issuer of a financial instrument that contains both a liability and an equity element, including warrants or options issued with and detachable from a financial liability, shall classify the instrument's component parts separately in accordance with paragraph 3856.20.
(Paragraphs 3856.A30-.A38 provide related application guidance.)
Acceptable methods for initial measurement of the separate liability and equity elements of an instrument issued in an arm's length transaction to which paragraph 3856.21 applies include the following:
The entire proceeds of the issue are allocated to the liability component.
The sum of the carrying amounts assigned to the liability and equity components on initial recognition is always equal to the carrying amount that would be ascribed to the instrument as a whole.
No gain or loss arises from recognizing and presenting the components of the instrument separately.
Acceptable methods for initial measurement of the separate liability and equity elements of an instrument issued in a related party transaction, to which paragraph 3856.21 applies, include the following:
The sum of the amounts assigned to the liability and equity components on initial recognition is always equal to the amount that would be ascribed to the instrument as a whole.
.23
An enterprise that issues retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares in a tax planning arrangement may choose to present those shares at par, stated or assigned value as a separate line item in the equity section of the balance sheet only when all of the following conditions are met:
control (see SUBSIDIARIES, Section 1591) of the enterprise issuing the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares in a tax planning arrangement is retained by the shareholder receiving the shares in the arrangement;
in the arrangement, either:
no consideration is received by the enterprise issuing the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares; or
only shares of the enterprise issuing the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares are exchanged; and
no other written or oral arrangement exists, such as a redemption schedule, that gives the holder of the shares the contractual right to require the enterprise to redeem the shares on a fixed or determinable date or within a fixed or determinable period.
If any of the above conditions are not met for any or all of the shares issued, the issuer shall classify those shares as a financial liability, present them separately on the balance sheet and measure them in accordance with paragraph 3856.09A.
Any resulting adjustment shall be recognized in either retained earnings or a separate component of equity (see EQUITY, Section 3251).
The issuer of retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares in a tax planning arrangement may choose to present the shares issued in that arrangement as a financial liability.
An enterprise that chooses to present the shares as a financial liability presents them separately on the balance sheet and measures them in accordance with paragraph 3856.09A.
.23AA
Retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement classified as a financial liability in accordance with paragraphs 3856.23 and 3856.23A, cannot subsequently be reclassified to equity.
.23B
If an enterprise issues retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares in a tax planning arrangement to two or more related parties (see RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, Section 3840), an assessment of which related party, if any, controls the enterprise is needed to determine whether the condition described in paragraph 3856.23(a) is met.
This assessment of control should be performed by applying the guidance for control in SUBSIDIARIES, Section 1591, which includes an analysis of all relevant facts and circumstances.
A related party has control over the enterprise which issues the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares when it has the continuing power to determine its strategic operating, investing and financing policies without the co-operation of others.
An enterprise shall only apply paragraph 3856.23B for the purpose of assessing the control condition as described in paragraph 3856.23(a).
.23C
Assessing which related party, if any, controls the enterprise is determined by analyzing all facts and circumstances.
For example, two spouses each receive 50 percent of the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued by an enterprise in a tax planning arrangement.
When assessing the control condition described in 3856.23(a), and assuming the conditions in 3856.23(b)-(c) are met, the result may be:
one of either spouse controls the enterprise and the shares held by the spouse who controls the enterprise would be classified as equity and the other spouse's shares would be classified as a financial liability; or
neither spouse controls the enterprise as control is jointly held (see INTERESTS IN JOINT ARRANGEMENTS, Section 3056).
Therefore, all of the shares would be classified as a financial liability.
If an enterprise issues retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares in a tax planning arrangement through a series of transactions in contemplation of one another, the transactions shall be viewed as one tax planning arrangement when assessing the conditions in paragraph 3856.23.
.23E
Retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement classified as equity in accordance with paragraph 3856.23 are not subsequently reclassified unless an event or transaction occurs that may indicate the conditions for equity classification in paragraph 3856.23 are no longer met.
Retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement reclassified as a financial liability are not subsequently reclassified as equity.
.23F
Examples of events or transactions that may indicate the conditions for equity classification in paragraph 3856.23 are no longer met include, but are not restricted to:
the death of the holder of the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement;
a change in the ownership of the enterprise that may affect the assessment of control of the enterprise that issued the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares in a tax planning arrangement;
a change in the shareholders' agreement that may affect the assessment of control of the enterprise that issued the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares in a tax planning arrangement;
redemption of some or all of the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement;
the creation of a written or oral arrangement that gives the holder of the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement the right to require the enterprise to redeem the shares within a fixed or determinable period; or
modifications to the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement.
.23G
If the event or transaction gives rise to a reclassification of the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement from equity to a financial liability, the enterprise shall measure the reclassified shares at the redemption amount on the date such an event or transaction occurs and present them separately on the balance sheet.
Any resulting adjustment shall be recorded in retained earnings or a separate component of equity in accordance with EQUITY, Section 3251.
Callable debt presentation (see Illustrative Example in CURRENT ASSETS AND CURRENT LIABILITIES, Section 1510) is not permitted for retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement classified as a financial liability.
A financial asset and a financial liability shall be offset, and the net amount reported in the balance sheet, only when an enterprise:
currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off the recognized amounts; and
intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
(Paragraphs 3856.A41-.A48 provide related application guidance.)
DERECOGNITION
An enterprise shall derecognize receivables transferred to another enterprise only when control has been surrendered (see Appendix B).
.26
An enterprise shall remove a financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) from its balance sheet when it is extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged or cancelled, or expires).
(Paragraphs 3856.A49-.A61 provide related application guidance.)
.27
Except as specified in paragraph 3856.27A, a transaction between a borrower and lender to replace a debt instrument with another instrument having substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Similarly, a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability or a part of it (whether or not attributable to the financial difficulty of the debtor) is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
A transaction between related parties to replace all or a part of a debt instrument with another instrument or to modify the terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial instrument.
(Paragraph 3856.A60A provides related application guidance.)
.28
Except as specified in paragraph 3856.28A, the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the fair value of the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred, liabilities assumed or equity instruments issued, shall be recognized in net income for the period.
Except as specified in paragraph 3856.28B, in a transaction between related parties, the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another related party and the amount of the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred, liabilities assumed or equity instruments issued, shall be recognized in:
equity, when the original transaction that resulted in the issuance or assumption of the financial liability was not in the normal course of operations; or
the original transaction that resulted in the issuance or assumption of the financial liability was in the normal course of operations; or
it is impracticable to determine whether the amount extinguished was issued or assumed in the normal or not in the normal course of operations.
A lender accounts for the forgiveness of a related party financial asset in accordance with paragraph 3856.19AA.
.28B
The extinguishment of financial liabilities, exchanged in a related party, non-reciprocal transaction by a not-for-profit organization shall be accounted for in accordance with CONTRIBUTIONS — REVENUE RECOGNITION, Section 4410 in Part III of the Handbook.
.29
When an issuer of a debt instrument repays or settles that instrument, the debt is extinguished.
If an enterprise repays a part of a financial liability issued in an arm's length transaction, the enterprise allocates the carrying amount of the financial liability at the date of repayment based on their relative fair values between the part that continues to be recognized and the part that is derecognized.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING
.30
Hedge accounting is optional.
The purpose of hedge accounting is to recognize offsetting gains, losses, revenues and expenses (including the effects of changes in cash flows) in net income in the same period or periods.
.31
A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting only when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
designates that hedge accounting will be applied to the hedging relationship; and
formally documents the hedging relationship, identifying the hedged item, the related hedging item, the nature of the specific risk exposure or exposures being hedged and the intended term of the hedging relationship.
.32
An enterprise may designate only the following hedging relationships:
an anticipated transaction denominated in a foreign currency hedged with a forward contract to mitigate the effect of changes in future foreign currency exchange rates (see paragraph 3856.A62);
an anticipated purchase or sale of a commodity hedged with a forward contract to mitigate the effect of future price changes of the commodity (see paragraphs 3856.A63-.A63C);
an interest-bearing asset or liability hedged with an interest rate swap to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates (see paragraph 3856.A64);
a foreign currency denominated interest-bearing asset or liability hedged with a cross-currency interest rate swap to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates (see paragraph 3856.A65); and
the net investment in a self-sustaining foreign operation hedged with a derivative or non-derivative financial instrument to mitigate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (see FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, paragraphs 1651.38-.41).
.33
An enterprise accounts for a qualifying hedge of an anticipated transaction as follows:
The gain or loss on the hedging item (forward contract, or the percentage of the contract relating to the hedged item) is recognized as an adjustment of the carrying amount of the hedged item when the anticipated transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability.
When the hedged item is recognized directly in net income, the gain or loss on the hedging item is included in the same category of income or expense.
When the hedged item is recognized, the gain or loss on the hedging item is transferred from the separate component of equity to the carrying amount of the hedged item or to net income in accordance with (a) (see paragraph 3856.A62A).
The gain or loss is included in the carrying amount of the hedged item or in net income in accordance with (a), with the offsetting amount recognized as a derivative-related asset or liability, as appropriate.
If a reporting period ends before the hedging item matures, the hedging item is remeasured using the spot price or rate in effect at the reporting period balance sheet date with any gain or loss included in net income.
When the hedging item matures, the derivative-related asset or liability is derecognized, the hedging item is recognized at the settlement amount, and any additional gain or loss on the hedging item is recognized in net income.
.34
An enterprise accounts for a qualifying hedge of an interest-bearing asset or liability as follows:
.35
An enterprise shall discontinue hedge accounting only when:
the hedged item or the hedging item ceases to exist other than as designated and documented;
the critical terms of the hedging item, as specified in paragraphs 3856.A62-.A65, cease to match those of the hedged item, including, but not limited to, when:
it becomes probable that an interest bearing asset or liability hedged with an interest rate or cross currency interest rate swap will be prepaid; and
the hedged item is an anticipated transaction and it is no longer probable that the anticipated commodity purchase or sale transaction or the settlement of the anticipated foreign currency transaction will occur in the amount designated or within 30 days of the maturity date of the hedging forward contract.
.36
Hedge accounting cannot be discontinued electively.
A hedging relationship no longer meets the objective of hedge accounting if either the hedged item or the hedging item ceases to exist prior to the intended end date of the hedging relationship or if circumstances change such that the critical terms of the hedging item no longer match those of the hedged item.
An enterprise accounts for a discontinued hedging relationship as follows:
a hedged item ceases to exist;
the critical terms of the hedging item cease to match those of the hedged item;
(iii) it becomes probable that the interest-bearing hedged item will be prepaid; or
(iv) the hedged item is an anticipated transaction and it is no longer probable that an anticipated commodity purchase or sale transaction or the settlement of an anticipated foreign currency transaction will occur in the amount designated or within 30 days of the maturity date of the hedging item; the hedging item is measured as otherwise required by this Section and any gain or loss is recognized in net income.

Earlier application is permitted.
.56
Notwithstanding the requirement in paragraph 3856.31(a) to designate and document all hedging relationships at inception, an enterprise may designate and document any hedging relationship that otherwise meets the requirements of this Section at any time prior to the end of the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2011.

An enterprise applies these amendments as specified in paragraph 3856.63.
.63
Except as specified in paragraphs 3856.64-.65, an enterprise may choose to apply the amendments specified in paragraph 3856.62, either:
at the beginning of the earliest period presented; or
at the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendments are first applied.
When the amendments specified in paragraph 3856.62 are applied:
at the beginning of the earliest period presented, the cumulative effect of applying the amendments is recorded in opening retained earnings or a separate component of equity of the earliest period presented; or

.64
When the amendments are applied for the first time, an enterprise that issued retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares in a tax planning arrangement may choose to present the shares as:
a financial liability measured in accordance with paragraph 3856.09A; or
in a separate line in the equity section of the balance sheet if:
the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares were issued on or after January 1, 2018, and all the conditions in paragraph 3856.23 are met; or
the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares were issued prior to January 1, 2018, and all the following conditions are met:
Control (see SUBSIDIARIES, Section 1591) of the enterprise that issued the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares in a tax planning arrangement is held by the party that owns the shares in the arrangement at the date of initial application.
The enterprise need not assess if control has been retained from the date of the initial transaction that gave rise to the shares.
No other written or oral arrangement exists such as a redemption schedule, that gives the holder of the shares the contractual right to require the enterprise to redeem the shares within a fixed or determinable period.
If both of the conditions above are not met for some or all of the retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement, those shares are classified as a financial liability, and measured in accordance with paragraph 3856.09A.
.65
When an enterprise chooses to apply the amendments at the beginning of the earliest period presented, in accordance with paragraph 3856.63(a), the enterprise is not required to make retrospective adjustments in respect of retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued in a tax planning arrangement that were extinguished prior to the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendments are first applied.

.68
An enterprise applies the amendments as follows:
for financial instruments originated or exchanged in a related party transaction that exist at the date these amendments are applied for the first time:
the cost of a financial instrument that does not have repayment terms is deemed to be the carrying amount of the instrument in the financial statements of the enterprise less any impairment measured in accordance with paragraph 3856.17B, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period for the period which the amendments are applied for the first time; or
(iii)the fair value of a financial instrument that is an investment in debt or equity instruments that are quoted in an active market, a debt instrument where inputs significant to the determination of the fair value of the instrument are observable or a derivative contract is determined at the beginning of the earliest comparative period for the period which the amendments are applied for the first time; and
for financial instruments exchanged in a related party transaction that do not exist at the date these amendments are applied for the first time, an enterprise need not restate the instrument as at the beginning of the earliest comparative period.

DEFINITIONS — DERIVATIVES
Financial instruments include primary instruments, such as receivables, payables and equity instruments, and derivative financial instruments, such as futures, forward, swap and option contracts.
Derivative financial instruments meet the definition of a financial instrument and, accordingly, are within the scope of this Section.
The definition of a derivative in this Section includes contracts that are settled gross by delivery of the underlying item (for example, a forward contract to purchase a fixed-rate debt instrument).
However, contracts to buy or sell non-financial items do not meet the definition of a financial instrument because the contractual right of one party to receive a non-financial asset or service and the corresponding obligation of the other party do not establish a present right or obligation to receive, deliver or exchange a financial asset.
When a financial instrument is issued or purchased at a premium or discount relative to its face amount, the difference represents a prepaid adjustment of interest.
This amount is a component of the initial carrying amount of the financial instrument.
When the financial instrument is measured at amortized cost, any premium or discount is amortized over the expected life of the item and recognized in net income as interest income or expense.
Similarly, when a lender charges a borrower a fee in lieu of interest, either when a financial instrument is initially recognized or periodically throughout its term, the amounts paid represent adjustments of interest.
Any such financing fee is recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial instrument and amortized over the expected life of the financial instrument or the period to which the fee relates, if shorter.
Amortization of prepaid interest in accordance with paragraphs 3856.A3-.A4 may be presented as a separate component of interest income or expense.
If a financial asset or a group of similar interest-bearing financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is thereafter recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
Fair value is defined as a price agreed upon by a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's length transaction.
Underlying the definition of fair value is a presumption that an enterprise is a going concern.
Therefore, fair value is not the amount that an enterprise would receive or pay in a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation, or distress sale.
Fair value reflects the credit quality of the instrument, including collateral or other credit enhancements.
The existence of published price quotations in an active market is the best evidence of fair value.

Debt instruments not quoted in an active market and for which inputs significant to the determination of the fair value of the instrument are not observable
Cost in accordance with paragraph 3856.08(a)
When part of the consideration given or received in a transaction to acquire or issue a financial instrument in an arm's length transaction is for something other than the financial instrument, its fair value is estimated using a valuation technique.
The fair value of a financial instrument with a non-market rate of interest is not equal to the cash consideration.
It can be estimated as the present value of all future cash receipts discounted using the prevailing market rates of interest for a similar instrument (similar as to currency, term, type of interest rate, or other factors) with a similar credit rating.
Any difference between the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability and the cash consideration is recognized immediately in net income unless it qualifies for recognition as some other type of asset or liability.
For example, when an enterprise receives an interest-free loan from a government agency, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the difference between the fair value of the loan and the cash received is accounted for as a government grant (see GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE, Section 3800).
Similarly, when an enterprise extends an interest-free loan to an employee, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the difference between the fair value of the loan and the cash paid to the employee is accounted for as employee compensation.
A contract may be written or oral.
Examples of financial instruments having repayment terms include:
trade accounts receivable and payable;
notes receivable and payable;
loans receivable and payable;
bonds receivable and payable;
debt instruments with no stated repayment terms deemed to be payable on demand in accordance with paragraph 3856.A12; and
retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares.
A8B
Examples of financial instruments that do not have repayment terms include:
common shares;
warrants;
preferred shares that do not have a stated redemption amount; and
options.
A8C
Some related party transactions include the exchange of multiple assets and liabilities.
When measuring financial instruments that do not have repayment terms in these transactions, the value of the instrument without repayment terms is determined using the residual of the total consideration transferred in the transaction less the amounts attributed to the other assets or liabilities recognized in the transaction.
A8D
A non-monetary related party transaction has commercial substance when the enterprise's future cash flows are expected to change significantly as a result of the transaction.
The enterprise's future cash flows are expected to change significantly when:
the enterprise-specific value of the asset received differs from the enterprise-specific value of the asset given up and the difference is significant in relation to the exchange amount of the items exchanged.
In some cases, a qualitative assessment will be conclusive in determining that the estimated cash flows of the enterprise are expected to change significantly as a result of the transaction.
A8E
The configuration of future cash flows is composed of the risk, timing and amount of the cash flows.
A change in any one or more of these considerations is a change in the configuration.
A8F
Enterprise-specific value, resulting from enterprise-specific measurement, differs from fair value.
It attempts to capture the value of an item in the context of the reporting enterprise.
The enterprise uses its expectations about its use of the asset rather than the use assumed by marketplace participants.
When a non-monetary related party transaction has commercial substance, it is measured at the exchange amount rather than enterprise-specific value.
A8G
Independent evidence in support of the use of an exchange amount of the consideration transferred includes at least one of the following:
independent appraisals, valuations or approvals, by appropriately qualified parties that are not related to the enterprise, carried out to determine the exchange amount;
comparable recently quoted market prices, in an open and unrestricted market;
comparable independent bids on the same transaction; or
comparable amounts of similar transactions actually undertaken with unrelated parties.
The sufficiency and appropriateness of independent evidence required to support the exchange amount of the consideration transferred is a matter of professional judgment.
Such evidence may be in the form of independent documentation supporting the exchange amount, or may be a result of the participation of unrelated parties in determining the exchange amount.
In some instances, several items of consistent evidence may be required to support the exchange amount.
In other instances, one piece of very persuasive evidence may be sufficient.
Generally, the more involved unrelated parties are in developing the evidence, the more persuasive it will be.
A8I
An enterprise may have a formal policy to bargain with related parties so that the enterprise would reject an offer from a related party if a better offer were received from an unrelated party.
When such bargaining involves unrelated parties, or those selected by the unrelated parties, or those appointed pursuant to regulatory requirements, to act on their behalf, it provides independent evidence to support use of the exchange amount.
Not all inputs used to determine the fair value of a debt instrument need be observable.
A valuation technique used to determine the fair value of a debt instrument may include inputs that are not observable to the extent that they have an insignificant effect on the fair value measurement of the instrument.

Decision tree for the initial measurement of financial instruments in a related party transaction
A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market when quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices reflect actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.
The appropriate quoted market price for an investment in an equity instrument is usually the latest closing price.
Non-option derivatives are usually measured using mid-market prices or rates.
Derivatives that are options are usually measured using bid prices for purchased options and ask prices for issued options.
Mid-market prices may be used.
A quote from a derivatives dealer may be used as a proxy for the fair value of a derivative.
At each reporting date, an enterprise uses consistent price quotes for each financial instrument measured at fair value.
In other words, an enterprise that applies a bid price to a financial instrument uses the most current bid price to remeasure that instrument.
When current rates or prices are unavailable, the price of the most recent transaction provides evidence of the current fair value so long as there has not been a significant change in economic circumstances since the time of that transaction.
When a quoted market price in an active market is no longer available for an equity instrument to which paragraph 3856.12(a) applies, and the enterprise does not elect to continue to carry the instrument at fair value in accordance with paragraph 3856.13(b), the fair value carrying amount of the instrument on that date becomes its cost.
The enterprise shall measure the instrument at this amount less any reduction for impairment until a quoted market price in an active market becomes available.
The fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature (for example, a demand deposit) is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount could be required to be paid.
A debt instrument with no stated repayment terms is deemed to be payable on demand.
When the payment of a debt instrument is subordinated to the interest of another party, the earliest date at which payment could be demanded is the day following the maturity of the instrument to which it is subordinated.
The interest rate used to discount a financial instrument payable on demand is determined by reference to rates available to the enterprise on a similar financial instrument maturing on, or as close as possible to, the first date that the instrument payable on demand could be required to be paid.
It incorporates any risk premium that a third party would charge for a financial instrument of comparable credit quality.
The subsequent measurement of a financial instrument is dependent on how the instrument was initially measured.
This table illustrates the initial measurement of a financial instrument as it pertains to the subsequent measurement of the instrument.
Additional application guidance on the initial measurement of financial instruments is available in paragraph 3856.A7A.

Each investment in another enterprise's equity instruments and each other financial asset that is individually significant is assessed individually for impairment.
Other financial assets are assessed for impairment either individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics.
Group assessment might be appropriate when available information is not sufficient to permit identification of each of the individual assets within a group that is impaired, or there are numerous assets affected by the same factors.
For example, an enterprise might collectively evaluate customers that operate in a particular industry or geographic region, or that share other identifiable common characteristics.
Indicators of impairment include:
significant financial difficulty of the customer or issuer;
a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;
the enterprise granting a concession to the customer or issuer;
it becoming probable that the customer or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization;
the disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of financial difficulties of the issuer;
a significant adverse change in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the customer or issuer operates (for example, a sharp decline in the price of a commodity, such as oil or lumber, may cause economic instability in the related industry or have an adverse effect on other customers in a region that is dependent on the particular industry); and
adverse national or local economic conditions or adverse changes in industry conditions indicate that there is a decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the group.
The following events or circumstances are not necessarily indicators of impairment:
the disappearance of an active market because an enterprise's financial instruments are no longer publicly traded;
when readily determinable, a decline in the fair value of a financial asset below its cost or amortized cost (for example, a decline in the fair value of an investment in a debt instrument that results from an increase in the basic, risk-free interest rate).
When a group of financial assets, such as accounts receivable, is comprised of large numbers of homogeneous balances of relatively small dollar amounts, impaired assets within the group are commonly identified based upon delays in receipt of payment.
The extent of impairment present in the group is estimated by applying formulae that take into account the analysis of arrears, aging of balances, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other relevant circumstances such as uncompensated payment delays.
To ensure that the loss ratios applied reflect the most current information available, it is necessary that the formulae be reviewed regularly.
For other groups of assets that share identifiable common characteristics, information available at the date of preparation of the financial statements may not be adequate to identify each individual impaired loan and the full extent of impairment within the group as a whole.
In such cases, the extent of additional impairment is estimated collectively based on the enterprise's judgment of the impact on the group of assets of recent events and changes in economic conditions that indicate the existence of impairment.
In making such judgments, consideration is given to the effect on loss experience of similar events and changes in conditions in the past.
Measurement of the extent of the additional impairment present in a group of assets is based on an assessment of the extent to which future cash flows are expected to be reduced or delayed.
The amount of the impairment loss on an unquoted equity instrument or a derivative asset that is linked to, and must be settled by delivery of, such an unquoted equity instrument is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
While the ability to estimate reliably the amounts and timing of the expected future cash flows from a group of assets is constrained by the limitations of the information available and the inability to assess the effect on individual accounts, reasonable assumptions can be made to achieve a result that is consistent with the measurement objective.
When an additional allowance for impairment is recognized against the remaining assets in a group after allowing for impairment identified on an asset-by-asset basis, it may be reasonable to assume that future cash flows are impaired in approximately the same proportion.
Impairment losses recognized on a group basis represent an interim step pending the identification of impairment losses on individual assets in the group of financial assets that are collectively assessed for impairment.
As soon as information is available that specifically identifies losses on individually impaired assets in a group, those assets are removed from the group.
A related party financial asset, or part thereof, is forgiven when the enterprise terminates all or part of a liability for payment to settle the financial asset.
Cancellation, set-off and release are examples of possible means of termination.
A21B
When an enterprise forgives a financial asset, or part thereof, due from a counterparty that is acting solely in the capacity of management, the amount forgiven is considered compensation and shall be recognized as an expense, by the enterprise, in net income.
LIABILITIES AND EQUITY
The substance of the contractual terms of a financial instrument, rather than its legal form, governs its classification on the issuer's balance sheet.
While substance and legal form are commonly consistent, this is not always the case.
For example, some financial instruments take the legal form of equity but are liabilities in substance, and others may combine features associated with equity instruments and features associated with financial liabilities.
The classification of an instrument is made on the basis of an assessment of its substance when it is first recognized.
Such a classification is not circumvented by non-substantive or minimal features included in the financial instrument.
Any non-substantive or minimal feature is disregarded in applying the classification provisions of this Section.
Judgment, based on consideration of all of the terms of an instrument and other relevant facts and circumstances, is necessary to distinguish substantive, non-minimal features from non-substantive or minimal features.
The classification made at inception continues at each subsequent reporting date until the terms of the financial instrument change or it is removed from the enterprise's balance sheet.
The critical feature in differentiating a financial liability from an equity instrument is the existence of a contractual obligation of one party to the financial instrument (the issuer) either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the other party (the holder) or to exchange another financial instrument with the holder under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the issuer.
When such a contractual obligation exists, that instrument meets the definition of a financial liability regardless of the manner in which the contractual obligation will be settled.
A restriction on the ability of the issuer to satisfy an obligation, such as lack of access to foreign currency or the need to obtain approval for payment from a regulatory authority, does not negate the issuer's obligation or the holder's right under the instrument.
An enterprise may have a contractual obligation of a fixed amount or an amount that fluctuates in part or in full in response to changes in a variable other than the market price of the enterprise's own equity instruments, but the enterprise must, or can, settle the obligation by delivery of its own equity instruments (the number of which depends on the amount of the obligation).
Such an obligation is a financial liability of the enterprise.
When the number of an enterprise's own shares or other equity instruments required to settle the obligation varies with changes in their fair value, so that the total fair value of the equity instruments to be delivered is based solely or predominantly on the amount of the contractual obligation, the counterparty does not hold a residual interest in the enterprise until it has received the equity instruments.
The enterprise may have to deliver more or fewer of its own equity instruments than would have been the case at the date of entering into the contractual arrangement.
Such an obligation is a financial liability of the enterprise even though the enterprise must or can settle by delivering its own equity instruments.
These financial liabilities are treated as monetary items.
When a financial instrument does not give rise to a contractual obligation on the part of the issuer to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange another financial instrument under conditions that are potentially unfavourable, it is an equity instrument.
Although the holder of an equity instrument may be entitled to receive a pro rata share of any dividends or other distributions out of equity, the issuer does not have a contractual obligation to make such distributions.
Thus, the terms and conditions of some preferred shares may be such that they meet the definition of an equity instrument and are classified accordingly.
When a preferred share, other than a share to which paragraph 3856.23 applies, provides for mandatory redemption by the issuer for a fixed or determinable amount at a fixed or determinable future date, or gives the holder the right to require the issuer to redeem the share at or after a particular date for a fixed or determinable amount, the instrument meets the definition of a financial liability and is classified as such.
A preferred share that does not establish such a contractual obligation explicitly may establish it indirectly through its terms and conditions.
For example, if a financial instrument labelled as a share gives the holder an option to require redemption upon the occurrence of a future event that is highly likely to occur, classification as a financial liability on initial recognition reflects the substance of the instrument.
An enterprise does not change the classification of the financial instrument based on a change in its estimate of the probability of the future event occurring.
If occurrence or non-occurrence of the future event does not result in the maturity, expiry, settlement, discharge or cancellation of the financial instrument, the enterprise derecognizes the original financial instrument and recognizes a new financial liability or equity instrument based on the remaining terms.
In the absence of a contractual obligation to redeem a financial instrument, economic compulsion does not cause the instrument to be classified as a financial liability.
Some financial instruments, such as partnership interests and certain types of shares in co-operative organizations, provide for payments to the holder of a pro rata share of the residual equity of the issuer.
These financial instruments may require redemption in specified circumstances that are certain to arise, such as the death of the holder, but do not impose an obligation on the issuer to deliver or exchange any specific amount of financial assets in advance of redemption.
On issuance, and subject to paragraph 3856.A28, such financial instruments constitute an equity instrument of the issuer.
When the holder subsequently chooses to withdraw its equity and is entitled to do so, the issuer may become obliged to make a payment that is fixed or determinable as to amount and timing.
This obligation satisfies the definition of a financial liability and is presented as such.
A retractable or mandatorily redeemable share, other than a share to which paragraph 3856.23 applies, is classified as a liability unless all of the following criteria are met:
The holders participate in the enterprise's residual net assets, or undistributed earnings (after any preferred shares are redeemed), on a pro rata basis.
Undistributed earnings are allocated to the shares based on their contractual participation rights.
Participation will include the right to participate in all dividends declared, including dividends that must be declared upon the occurrence of a specified event, the occurrence of which is subject to management discretion or is not objectively determinable (for example, liquidation of the enterprise or declaration of an "extraordinary" dividend).
There cannot be a class of common shares with the same degree of subordination that is not entitled to the same redemption feature.
The basis for determination of the redemption price is the same for all shares.
However, the redemption price may be determined based on the fair value of the redeemable shares at the redemption date, or it may be based on a formula (which might be book value) that all the shareholders agree on as being equitable, provided the same basis or formula is applied to all of the redeemable shares.
All of the redeemable shares include substantially similar characteristics to the enterprise's common shares; for example, they do not include any substantive liquidation preferences or dividend distribution preferences.
However, this criterion does not require all of the shares to be redeemed at the same time.
Rather, it requires that the same event or events trigger redemption rights for all shares, for example, redemption on the resignation, termination, retirement or death of the shareholder.
When an event occurs that triggers the redemption right, the shares are reclassified as liabilities.
Decision tree — Classification of retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares
Paragraph 3856.20 requires the separate presentation on an issuer's balance sheet of liability and equity elements created by a single financial instrument.
It is more a matter of form than substance that both liabilities and equity interests are created by a single financial instrument rather than two or more separate instruments.
Consequently, the same accounting applies whether the liability and equity interests are created by a single instrument or by two or more separate but linked instruments (see paragraphs 3856.21-.22A).
An issuer's financial position is more faithfully represented by separate presentation of the liability and equity components contained in a single instrument according to their nature.
For purposes of balance sheet presentation, an issuer recognizes separately the component parts of a financial instrument that creates a financial liability of the issuer and grants an option to the holder of the instrument to convert it into an equity instrument of the issuer.
A bond or similar instrument convertible by the holder into common shares of the issuer is an example of such an instrument.
From the perspective of the issuer, such an instrument comprises two components: a financial liability (a contractual arrangement to deliver cash or other financial assets) and an equity instrument (a call option granting the holder the right, for a specified period of time, to convert into common shares of the issuer).
The economic effect of issuing such an instrument is substantially the same as issuing simultaneously a debt instrument with an early settlement provision and warrants to purchase common shares, or issuing a debt instrument with detachable share purchase warrants.
Accordingly, in all cases, the issuer presents the liability and equity elements separately on its balance sheet.
Classification of the liability and equity components of a convertible instrument is not revised as a result of a change in the likelihood that a conversion option will be exercised, even when exercise of the option may appear to have become economically advantageous to some holders.
Holders may not always act in the manner that might be expected because, for example, the tax consequences resulting from conversion may differ among holders.
Furthermore, the likelihood of conversion will change from time to time.
The issuer's obligation to make future payments remains outstanding until it is extinguished through conversion, the maturity of the instrument or some other transaction.
A financial instrument may contain components that are neither financial liabilities nor equity instruments of the issuer.
For example, an instrument may give the holder the right to receive a non-financial asset such as a commodity in settlement and an option to exchange that right for shares of the issuer.
The issuer recognizes and presents the equity instrument (the exchange option) separately from the liability components of the compound instrument, whether the liabilities are financial or non-financial.
When an option to convert a financial liability to equity is exercised and the issuer settles the obligation by issuing shares in accordance with the original terms of the instrument, the carrying amount of the equity element, if any, plus the carrying amount of the liability element (including any accrued but unpaid interest), are transferred to share capital.
No gain or loss is recognized on this form of conversion because it is according to the original terms of the instrument.
When an option to convert a financial liability issued in an arm's length transaction to equity is exercised and the issuer settles the obligation in cash, the enterprise accounts for the settlement as the extinguishment of the instrument, and a gain or loss on extinguishment of the liability element is recognized in net income (see paragraphs 3856.20-.23, and 3856.A49-.A61).
The settlement of the equity element is recognized as a capital transaction (see CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS, Section 3610), with any gain credited to contributed surplus and any loss applied first against contributed surplus to the extent of prior gains, and then against retained earnings.
On extinguishment of a convertible debt instrument issued in an arm's length transaction, the issuer allocates the consideration paid to the liability and equity elements as follows:
When the issuer of an instrument that was issued in an arm's length transaction offers a more favourable conversion ratio than the original ratio specified in the debt agreement, or offers additional shares if the holder converts the debt security by a specified time (i.e., in an induced early conversion), the number of shares converted under the terms of the original instrument is measured at the original contract price (i.e., based on the original conversion ratio) and any additional shares issued to induce the conversion are measured at fair value.
Any resulting gain or loss is treated as follows:
the amount of gain or loss relating to the liability element is credited or charged to income; and
the difference between the carrying amount and the amount considered to be settled relating to the holder option element is treated as a capital transaction.
In a transaction between related parties, when an option to convert a financial liability to equity is exercised and the issuer settles the obligation in cash, the enterprise accounts for the settlement as the extinguishment of the instrument, and any difference on extinguishment of the liability element is measured and recognized in accordance with paragraph 3856.28A.
A37B
On extinguishment of a convertible debt instrument issued in a related party transaction, the issuer allocates the consideration paid to the liability and equity elements as follows:
the consideration is allocated first to the liability, up to the carrying amount of the debt, including accrued interest and the excess, if any, is accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 3856.04A or 3856.28A.
if the consideration paid to extinguish the instrument is less than the carrying amount of the liability, any shortfall is accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 3856.28A or 3856.28B.
A37C
When the issuer of an instrument that was issued in a related party transaction offers a more favourable conversion ratio than the original ratio specified in the debt agreement, or offers additional shares if the holder converts the debt security by a specified time (i.e., in an induced early conversion), the number of shares converted under the terms of the original instrument is measured at the original contract price (i.e., based on the original conversion ratio) and any additional shares issued to induce the conversion are measured at fair value.
the difference relating to the liability element is recognized in accordance with paragraph 3856.28A; and
If an option to convert a financial liability to equity is not exercised and the conversion option expires at maturity, the issuer accounts for the settlement of the instrument at its redemption value (which, at that time, is also the stated principal amount of the instrument).
Accordingly, the liability element is derecognized, and the carrying amount of the equity element, if any, is transferred to contributed surplus.
If the enterprise settles the debt element through issuance of shares, the redemption value of the debt element is credited to share capital.
The classification of a financial instrument in the balance sheet determines whether interest, dividends, losses and gains relating to that instrument are classified as expenses or income and reported in the income statement.
Thus, dividend payments on shares classified as liabilities are classified as expenses in the same way as interest on a bond and reported in net income.
Similarly, gains and losses associated with redemptions or refinancings of instruments classified as liabilities are reported in net income, while redemptions or refinancings of instruments classified as equity are reported as changes in equity.
Dividends classified as an expense may be presented in the income statement either with interest on other liabilities or as a separate item.
Disclosure of interest and dividends is subject to the requirements of INCOME STATEMENT, Section 1520.
In some circumstances, because of significant differences between interest and dividends with respect to matters such as tax deductibility, it is desirable to disclose them separately within the income statement.
Disclosures of the amounts of tax effects are made in accordance with INCOME TAXES, Section 3465.
OFFSETTING OF A FINANCIAL ASSET AND A FINANCIAL LIABILITY
Paragraph 3856.24 requires the presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis when this reflects an enterprise's expected future cash flows from settling two or more separate financial instruments.
When an enterprise has the right to receive or pay a single net amount and intends to do so, it has, in effect, only a single financial asset or financial liability.
In other circumstances, financial assets and financial liabilities are presented separately from each other consistent with their characteristics as resources or obligations of the enterprise.
Offsetting a recognized financial asset and a recognized financial liability and presenting the net amount differs from ceasing to recognize a financial asset or a financial liability.
While offsetting does not give rise to recognition of a gain or a loss, ceasing to recognize a financial instrument not only results in the removal of the previously recognized item from the balance sheet, but may also result in recognition of a gain or a loss.
A right of set-off is a debtor's legal right, by contract or otherwise, to settle or otherwise eliminate all or a portion of an amount due to a creditor by applying against that amount an amount due from the creditor.
In unusual circumstances, a debtor may have a legal right to apply an amount due from a third party against the amount due to a creditor, provided that there is an agreement among the three parties that clearly establishes the debtor's right of set-off.
Since the right of set-off is a legal right, the conditions supporting the right may vary from one legal jurisdiction to another, and care must be taken to establish which laws apply to the relationships between the parties.
The existence of an enforceable right to set off a financial asset and a financial liability affects the rights and obligations associated with a financial asset and a financial liability, and may affect significantly an enterprise's exposure to credit and liquidity risk.
However, the existence of the right, by itself, is not a sufficient basis for offsetting.
In the absence of an intention to exercise the right or to settle simultaneously, the amount and timing of an enterprise's future cash flows are not affected.
When an enterprise does intend to exercise the right or to settle simultaneously, presentation of the asset and liability on a net basis reflects more appropriately the amounts and timing of the expected future cash flows as well as the risks to which those cash flows are exposed.
An intention by one or both parties to settle on a net basis without the legal right to do so is not sufficient to justify offsetting since the rights and obligations associated with the individual financial asset and financial liability remain unaltered.
An enterprise's intentions with respect to settlement of particular assets and liabilities may be influenced by its normal business practices, the requirements of the financial markets and other circumstances that may limit the ability to settle net or to settle simultaneously.
Simultaneous settlement of two financial instruments may occur through, for example, the operation of a clearinghouse in an organized financial market or a face-to-face exchange.
In these circumstances, the cash flows are, in effect, equivalent to a single net amount and there is no exposure to credit or liquidity risk.
In other circumstances, an enterprise may settle two instruments by receiving and paying separate amounts, becoming exposed to credit risk for the full amount of the asset or liquidity risk for the full amount of the liability.
Such risk exposures may be significant even though relatively brief.
Accordingly, realization of a financial asset and settlement of a financial liability are considered simultaneous only when the transactions occur at the same moment.
The conditions in paragraph 3856.24 are generally not satisfied and offsetting is usually inappropriate when, for example:
several different financial instruments are used to emulate the features of a single financial instrument (i.e., a "synthetic instrument");
financial assets and financial liabilities arise from financial instruments having the same primary risk exposure (for example, assets and liabilities within a portfolio of forward contracts or other derivative instruments) but involve different counterparties;
financial or other assets are pledged as collateral for non-recourse financial liabilities;
financial assets are set aside in trust by a debtor for the purpose of discharging an obligation without those assets having been accepted by the creditor in settlement of the obligation (for example, a sinking fund arrangement); or
obligations incurred as a result of events giving rise to losses are expected to be recovered from a third party by virtue of a claim made under an insurance policy.
Such an agreement provides for a single net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event of default on, or termination of, any one contract.
These arrangements are commonly used by financial institutions to provide protection against loss in the event of bankruptcy or other events that result in a counterparty being unable to meet its obligations.
A master netting arrangement commonly creates a right of set-off that becomes enforceable and affects the realization or settlement of individual financial assets and financial liabilities only following a specified event of default or in other circumstances not expected to arise in the normal course of business.
A master netting arrangement does not provide a basis for offsetting unless the circumstance making it a current right has already occurred and both of the criteria in paragraph 3856.24 are satisfied.
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
A financial liability (or part of it) is extinguished when the debtor:
discharges the liability (or part of it) by paying the creditor, normally with cash, other financial assets, goods, or services; or
is legally released from primary responsibility for the liability (or part of it), either by process of law or by the creditor. (When the debtor has given a guarantee, this condition may still be met.)
A transfer of debt instruments between debt holders does not result in a modification of the terms of the original debt instrument or an exchange of debt instruments between the debtor and the debt holders.
When a debtor pays a third party to assume an obligation and notifies its creditor that the third party has assumed its debt obligation, the debtor does not derecognize the debt obligation unless the condition in paragraph 3856.A49(b) is met.
Payment to a third party, including a trust (sometimes called "in-substance defeasance"), does not, by itself, relieve the debtor of its primary obligation to the creditor, in the absence of legal release.
When the debtor pays a third party to assume an obligation and obtains a legal release from its creditor, the debtor has extinguished the debt.
However, when the debtor agrees to make payments on the debt to the third party or directly to its original creditor, the debtor recognizes a new debt obligation to the third party.
In order to determine whether there has been a modification or exchange of debt instruments in transactions involving a third party intermediary, it is necessary to determine whether the intermediary is acting as an agent or as a principal.
If the intermediary acts on behalf of the debtor and does not place its own funds at risk, there is an agency relationship and the actions of the intermediary are viewed as those of the debtor.
However, if the intermediary commits its own funds and is subject to the risk of loss of those funds, the intermediary is acting as a principal and is viewed as a third party creditor similar to any other creditor.
In order to determine whether the third party intermediary is acting as an agent or a principal, all the facts surrounding the role of the intermediary are evaluated.
For the purpose of paragraph 3856.27, the terms of a renegotiated financial liability differ substantially from the original liability when:
the present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received differs by at least 10 percent from the present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability, both discounted at the original interest rate; or
there is a change in the creditor and the original debt is legally discharged by the debtor through a cash payment or otherwise.
In comparing the present value of discounted cash flows in accordance with paragraph 3856.A52(a), an enterprise includes changes in principal amounts, interest rates or maturity as well as fees exchanged between the debtor and creditor to effect changes in such attributes as:
recourse or non-recourse features;
priority of the obligation;
collateralized (including changes in collateral) or non-collateralized features;
debt covenants or waivers;
the guarantor (or elimination of the guarantor); or
call or redemption features.
When an exchange of debt instruments (exchange) or a modification of the terms of a financial liability (modification) issued in an arm's length transaction is accounted for as an extinguishment in accordance with paragraph 3856.26, the debtor accounts for the difference between:
the fair value of the new debt instrument; and
the carrying amount of the original debt instrument (together with all unamortized financing fees and transaction costs accounted for as adjustments to the original debt instrument).
When an exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, fees and transaction costs accounted for as adjustments to the original debt instrument continue to be recognized as a component of the carrying amount of the debt instrument and, together with fees and transaction costs related to the renegotiation, are amortized over the remaining term of the renegotiated debt (see paragraph 3856.A4).
For the purpose of paragraph 3856.27, the terms of a renegotiated line of credit or revolving debt arrangement issued in an arm's length transaction differ substantially from the original liability when the product of the remaining term and the maximum available credit (the borrowing capacity) of the old arrangement exceeds the borrowing capacity of the new arrangement.
Fees and transaction costs associated with a line of credit or revolving debt arrangement relate to securing the availability of financing for a specified period of time.
Accordingly, standby fees and transaction costs paid by enterprise are recognized as an asset and amortized over the period to which they relate.
When a line of credit or revolving debt arrangement is renegotiated, fees and costs associated with the renegotiation are amortized over the term of the new arrangement.
Any unamortized fees and costs associated with the old arrangement are amortized over the term of the new arrangement when the borrowing capacity of the new arrangement is greater than or equal to the borrowing capacity of the old arrangement.
When the borrowing capacity of the new arrangement is less than the borrowing capacity of the old arrangement, any unamortized fees and costs relating to the old arrangement at the time of the change are written off in proportion to the decrease in borrowing capacity of the old arrangement.
The remaining unamortized costs relating to the old arrangement are recognized as an asset and amortized over the term of the new arrangement.
In some arm's length transactions, a creditor releases a debtor from its present obligation to make payments, but the debtor assumes a guarantee obligation to pay if the party assuming primary responsibility defaults.
In this circumstance, the debtor:
recognizes a new financial liability based on the fair value of its obligation under the guarantee; and
recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between:
any amounts paid; and
the carrying amount of the original financial liability less the fair value of the new financial liability.
The issue of an enterprise's equity instruments to a creditor to extinguish all or part of a financial liability is consideration paid in accordance with paragraphs 3856.28-.28A.
An enterprise initially measures equity instruments issued to a creditor in an arm's length transaction to extinguish all or part of a financial liability at either the fair value of the equity instruments issued or the fair value of the liability extinguished.
An enterprise initially measures equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish all or part of a financial liability issued in a related party transaction at the carrying amount of the liability extinguished.
If only part of the financial liability issued in an arm's length transaction is extinguished by the issue of equity instruments, the enterprise also assesses the terms of the financial liability that remains outstanding to determine whether they are substantially different from those of the original financial liability.
If the terms of the financial liability that remains outstanding are substantially different from those of the original financial liability, the enterprise accounts for the modification as the extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability in accordance with paragraph 3856.26.
An enterprise may designate a foreign exchange forward contract as a hedge of an anticipated foreign currency transaction or a group of foreign currency transactions only when:
the forward contract is for the purchase or sale of the same amount of the same currency as the designated hedged anticipated transaction or group of transactions;
the forward contract matures within 30 days of the settlement of each designated anticipated transaction;
it is probable the settlement of each anticipated foreign currency transaction will occur at the time and in the amount expected; and
the fair value of the forward contract at the inception of the hedging relationship is zero.
Foreign exchange forward contracts may be settled net by transferring the gain or loss amount, or gross by exchanging the two currencies.
When a foreign exchange forward contract is designated as a hedge of an anticipated purchase transaction and the contract settles gross before the purchase is recognized, the foreign currency acquired on settlement of the contract is initially recognized at the spot rate in effect on the settlement date.
When the foreign currency is held continuously between the date the contract is settled and the date the purchase transaction is recognized, any gain or loss on translating the foreign currency cash held is presented as a separate component of equity until the purchase is recognized.
When the purchase is recognized, the gain or loss on the foreign currency held is transferred from the separate component of equity to the carrying amount of the asset acquired in the purchase transaction or to net income in accordance with paragraph 3856.33(a).
An enterprise may designate a forward contract as a hedge of an anticipated purchase or sale of a commodity or a group of anticipated purchases and sales only when:
the commodity forward contract is for the purchase or sale of the same quantity and similar grade or purity of the same commodity as the designated hedged anticipated purchases or sales;
it is probable that each hedged anticipated purchase or sale will occur within 30 days of the maturity of the commodity forward contract;
it is probable that each anticipated commodity purchase or sale will occur at the time and in the amount expected; and
In many circumstances, commodity transactions are undertaken in currencies other than that in which an enterprise measures transactions for financial reporting purposes.
An enterprise may decide to enter into a foreign exchange forward contract to mitigate the currency risk created by the following commodity hedging relationships:
an anticipated purchase or sale of a commodity denominated in the currency in which the enterprise measures transactions for financial reporting purposes hedged with a commodity forward contract denominated in a foreign currency;
an anticipated purchase or sale of a commodity denominated in a foreign currency hedged with a commodity forward contract denominated in the same foreign currency; and
an anticipated purchase or sale of a commodity denominated in a foreign currency hedged with a commodity forward contract denominated in the currency in which an enterprise measures transactions for financial reporting purposes.
A63B
When the hedged item (the anticipated purchase or sale of a commodity) is denominated in a foreign currency (the circumstances referred to in paragraph 3856.A63A(b) or (c)), a commodity forward contract may be designated as hedging the commodity price risk in the hedged item if it meets the conditions in paragraph 3856.A63.
A foreign exchange forward contract may also be designated as hedging the currency risk in the anticipated purchase or sale in a separate hedging relationship provided it meets the conditions in paragraph 3856.A62.
A63C
When the hedged item (the anticipated purchase or sale of a commodity) is not denominated in a foreign currency and the commodity price risk is hedged with a commodity forward contract denominated in a foreign currency (paragraph 3856.A63A(a)), the commodity forward contract meeting the conditions in paragraph 3856.A63 may be designated as a hedge of the anticipated transaction in combination with a foreign exchange forward contract with the following terms:
the foreign exchange forward contract converts the same amount of the same currency as the commodity forward contract into the currency of the anticipated purchase or sale; and
the foreign exchange forward contract matures on the same day as the commodity forward contract.
An enterprise may designate an interest rate swap as a hedge of interest rate risk exposure in a recognized interest-bearing asset or liability only when all of the applicable criteria in the following list are satisfied:
Accordingly, the fixed rate is the same throughout the term, and the variable rate is based on the same index and includes the same constant adjustment or no adjustment.
An enterprise may designate a cross-currency interest rate swap as a hedge of a recognized foreign currency interest-bearing asset or liability only when all of the conditions in paragraph 3856.A64 apply, except as follows:
Accordingly, the fixed rate is the same throughout the term, and the variable rate is based on the same index and includes the same constant adjustment or no adjustment.
Transactions in financial instruments may result in an enterprise assuming or transferring to another party one or more of the financial risks described below.
The required disclosures provide information that assists users of financial statements in assessing the extent of risk related to financial instruments.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Concentrations of credit risk may arise from:
industry sectors.
Thus, if an enterprise's counterparties are concentrated in one or more industry sectors (such as retail or wholesale), it discloses separately exposure to risks arising from each concentration of counterparties.
credit rating or other measure of credit quality.
geographical distribution.
Thus, if an enterprise's counterparties are concentrated in one or more geographical markets, it discloses separately exposure to risks arising from each concentration of counterparties.
a limited number of individual counterparties or groups of closely related counterparties.
Similar principles apply to identifying concentrations of other risks, including liquidity risk and market risk.
For example, concentrations of liquidity risk may arise from the repayment terms of financial liabilities, sources of borrowing facilities or reliance on a particular market in which to realize liquid assets.
Concentrations of foreign exchange risk may arise if an enterprise has a significant net open position in a single foreign currency, or aggregate net open positions in several currencies that tend to move together.

B1
This Appendix focuses particularly on transactions that result in the transferor having some continuing interest in transferred assets.
The principal issue addressed is when to account for securitizations of receivables and similar types of transactions as sales of the transferred assets, and when to account for such transactions as secured borrowings.
This Appendix also indicates how to account for a sale transaction, including the resulting gain or loss.
B2
This Appendix does not address:
transfers of custody of financial assets for safekeeping, contributions or investments by owners, or distributions to owners of a business enterprise;
B3
In a transfer of receivables, recognition of assets and liabilities is unaffected by the sequence of transactions that result in their acquisition or incurrence unless the effect of those transactions is to maintain effective control over a transferred receivable.
For example, if a transferor sells receivables it owns and at the same time writes an "at-the-money" put option (such as a guarantee or recourse obligation) on those receivables, it recognizes the put obligation in the same manner as would another unrelated entity that writes an identical put option on receivables it never owned.
However, certain agreements to repurchase or redeem transferred receivables maintain effective control over those receivables and, therefore, are accounted for differently than agreements to acquire receivables never owned.
The following terms are used in this Appendix with the meanings specified:
Thus, a transfer includes selling a receivable, putting it into a securitization trust, or posting it as collateral but excludes the origination of that receivable, the settlement of that receivable, or the restructuring of that receivable into a security in a troubled debt restructuring.
For example, a third-party intermediary is an agent of the transferor if it acts on behalf of the transferor.
Rather than being an obligation of the transferee, an attached call is traded with and diminishes the value of the underlying instrument transferred subject to that call.
Depending on the servicing contract, those fees may include some or all of the difference between the interest rate collectible on the asset being serviced and the rate to be paid to the beneficial owners of those assets.
For example, a bond may allow the issuer to call it by posting a public notice well before its stated maturity that asks the current holder to submit it for early redemption and provides that interest ceases to accrue on the bond after the early redemption date.
Rather than being an obligation of the initial purchaser of the bond, an embedded call trades with and diminishes the value of the underlying bond.
A servicing contract is either undertaken in conjunction with selling or securitizing the receivables being serviced, or purchased or assumed separately.
The proportion owned may be pro rata (for example, the right to receive 50 percent of all cash flows from a security), or non-pro rata (for example, the right to receive the interest from a security while another has the right to the principal).
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF TRANSFERRED RECEIVABLES
B5
A transfer of receivables (or all or a portion of a receivable) in which the transferor surrenders control over those receivables is accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange.
The transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if all of the following conditions are met:
an agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity (see paragraphs 3856.B26-.B28 and 3856.B34-.B37); or
the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call (see paragraphs 3856.B29-.B33).
B6
The nature and extent of supporting evidence required for an assertion in financial statements that transferred receivables have been isolated — put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, either by a single transaction or a series of transactions taken as a whole — depend on the facts and circumstances.
An entity considers all available evidence that either supports or questions an assertion. That consideration includes making judgments about whether the contract or circumstances permit the transferor to revoke the transfer.
It also may include making judgments about the kind of bankruptcy or other receivership into which a transferor or SPE might be placed, whether a transfer of receivables would likely be deemed a true sale at law, whether the transferor is affiliated with the transferee, and other factors pertinent under applicable law.
Derecognition of transferred assets is appropriate only if the available evidence provides reasonable assurance that the transferred assets would be beyond the reach of the powers of a bankruptcy trustee or other receiver for the transferor or any consolidated affiliate of the transferor that is not a special-purpose corporation or other entity designed to make remote the possibility that it would enter bankruptcy or other receivership.
B7
A securitization carried out in one transfer or a series of transfers may or may not isolate the transferred assets beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors.
Whether it does depends on the structure of the securitization transaction taken as a whole, considering such factors as the type and extent of further involvement in arrangements to protect investors from credit and interest rate risks, the availability of other assets, and the powers of courts, bankruptcy trustees, receivers and similar authorities.
The powers of courts, bankruptcy trustees, receivers and similar authorities in different jurisdictions may vary considerably, and therefore some of these authorities may be able to reach receivables transferred under a particular structure and others may not.
Conditions that constrain a transferee
B8
Sale accounting is allowed under paragraph 3856.B5(b) only if each transferee has the right to pledge, or the right to exchange, the transferred assets or beneficial interests it received, but constraints on that right also matter.
Many transferor-imposed or other conditions on a transferee's right to pledge or exchange a transferred asset both constrain a transferee from pledging or exchanging the transferred assets and, through that constraint, provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor.
For example, a provision in the transfer contract that prohibits selling or pledging a transferred loan receivable not only constrains the transferee but also provides the transferor with the more than trivial benefits of knowing who has the asset, a prerequisite to repurchasing the asset, and of being able to block the asset from finding its way into the hands of a competitor for the loan customer's business or someone that the loan customer might consider an undesirable creditor.
Transferor-imposed contractual constraints that narrowly limit timing or terms, for example, allowing a transferee to pledge only on the day assets are obtained or only on terms agreed with the transferor, also constrain the transferee and presumptively provide the transferor with more than trivial benefits.
B9
However, some conditions do not constrain a transferee from pledging or exchanging the asset and therefore do not preclude a transfer subject to such a condition from being accounted for as a sale.
For example, a transferor's right of first refusal on the occurrence of a bona fide offer to the transferee from a third party presumptively would not constrain a transferee, because that right in itself does not enable the transferor to compel the transferee to sell the assets and the transferee would be in a position to receive the sum offered by exchanging the asset, albeit possibly from the transferor rather than the third party.
Further examples of conditions that presumptively would not constrain a transferee include:
a requirement to obtain the transferor's permission to sell or pledge that is not to be unreasonably withheld,
a prohibition on sale to the transferor's competitor if other potential willing buyers exist,
a regulatory limitation such as on the number or nature of eligible transferees (as in the case of securities issued under regulations applicable to private placements or debt placed privately), and
illiquidity, for example, the absence of an active market.
Judgment is required to assess the significance of some conditions.
For example, a prohibition on sale to the transferor's competitor would be a significant constraint if that competitor were the only potential willing buyer other than the transferor.
B10
A condition imposed by a transferor that constrains the transferee presumptively provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor.
A condition not imposed by the transferor that constrains the transferee may or may not provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor.
For example, if the transferor refrains from imposing its usual contractual constraint on a specific transfer because it knows an equivalent constraint is already imposed on the transferee by a third party, it presumptively benefits more than trivially from that constraint.
However, the transferor cannot benefit from a constraint if it is unaware at the time of the transfer that the transferee is constrained.
Transferor's rights or obligations to reacquire transferred assets
B11
Some rights or obligations to reacquire transferred assets both constrain the transferee and provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor, thus precluding sale accounting under paragraph 3856.B5(b).
For example, a freestanding call option written by a transferee to the transferor benefits the transferor and, if the transferred assets are not readily obtainable in the marketplace, is likely to constrain a transferee because it might have to default if the call was exercised and it had exchanged or pledged the assets.
A freestanding forward purchase-sale contract between the transferor and the transferee on transferred assets not readily obtainable in the marketplace would benefit the transferor and is likely to constrain a transferee in much the same manner.
Judgment is necessary to assess constraint and benefit.
For example, put options written to the transferee generally do not constrain it, but a put option on a not-readily-obtainable asset may benefit the transferor and effectively constrain the transferee if the option is sufficiently deep-in-the-money when it is written that it is probable that the transferee will exercise it and the transferor will reacquire the transferred asset.
In contrast, a sufficiently out-of-the-money call option held by the transferor may not constrain a transferee if it is probable when the option is written that it will not be exercised.
Freestanding rights to reacquire transferred assets that are readily obtainable presumptively do not constrain the transferee from exchanging or pledging them and thus do not preclude sale accounting under paragraph 3856.B5(b).
B12
Other rights or obligations to reacquire transferred assets, regardless of whether they constrain the transferee, may result in the transferor's maintaining effective control over the transferred assets, as discussed in paragraphs 3856.B29-.B33, thus precluding sale accounting under paragraph 3856.B5(c)(ii).
It is also necessary to consider the overall effect of related rights and obligations in assessing such matters as whether a transferee is constrained or a transferor has maintained effective control.
For example, if the transferor or its affiliate or agent is the servicer for the transferred asset, is empowered to decide to put the asset up for sale, and has the right of first refusal, that combination would place the transferor in a position to unilaterally cause the return of a specific transferred asset and thus maintain the transferor's effective control of the transferred asset as discussed in paragraphs 3856.B5(c)(ii) and 3856.B29.
For example, if BIHs agree to sell their beneficial interests in a qualifying SPE back to the transferor upon request at the price paid plus a stated return, that arrangement clearly conveys more than a trivial benefit to the transferor; sale accounting for the transfer to the qualifying SPE would be precluded if that agreement constrained a BIH from exchanging or pledging its beneficial interest.
B14
A qualifying SPE is a trust or other legal vehicle that meets all of the following conditions:
are significantly limited;
were entirely specified in the legal documents that established the SPE or created the beneficial interests in the transferred assets that it holds; and
(iii) may be significantly changed only with the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the beneficial interests held by entities other than any transferor, its affiliates, and its agents (see paragraphs 3856.B16-.B17).
financial assets transferred to it that are passive in nature (see paragraph 3856.B18);
passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests (other than another derivative financial instrument) issued or sold to parties other than the transferor, its affiliates, or its agents (see paragraphs 3856.B18-.B19);
(iii) financial assets (for example, guarantees or rights to collateral) that would reimburse it if others were to fail to adequately service financial assets transferred to it or to timely pay obligations due to it and that it entered into when it was established, when assets were transferred to it, or when beneficial interests (other than derivative financial instruments) were issued by the SPE;
(iv) servicing rights related to financial assets that it holds;
temporarily, non-financial assets obtained in connection with the collection of financial assets that it holds (see paragraph 3856.B20); and
(vi) cash collected from assets that it holds and investments purchased with that cash pending distribution to holders of beneficial interests that are appropriate for that purpose (i.e., money market or other relatively risk-free instruments without options and with maturities no later than the expected distribution date).
is specified in the legal documents that established the SPE or created the beneficial interests in the transferred assets that it holds;
is outside the control of the transferor, its affiliates, or its agents; and
causes, or is expected at the date of transfer to cause, the fair value of those financial assets to decline by a specified degree below the fair value of those assets when the SPE obtained them (see paragraphs 3856.B21-.B22).
(iii) Exercise by the transferor of a call or removal-of-accounts provision specified in the legal documents that established the SPE, transferred assets to the SPE, or created the beneficial interests in the transferred assets that it holds (see paragraphs 3856.B30-.B37).
(iv) Termination of the SPE or maturity of the beneficial interests in those financial assets on a fixed or determinable date that is specified at inception (see paragraph 3856.B24).
A qualifying SPE is demonstrably distinct from the transferor only if it cannot be unilaterally dissolved by any transferor, its affiliates, or its agents, and at least 10 percent of the fair value of its beneficial interests is held by parties other than any transferor, its affiliates, or its agents.
An ability to unilaterally dissolve an SPE can take many forms, including but not limited to holding sufficient beneficial interests to demand that the trustee dissolve the SPE, the right to call all the assets transferred to the SPE, and a right to call or a prepayment privilege on the beneficial interests held by other parties.
B16
The powers of the SPE must be limited to those activities allowed by paragraph 3856.B14 for it to be a qualifying SPE.
Many kinds of entities are not so limited.
For example, any bank, insurance company, pension plan, or investment company has powers that cannot be sufficiently limited for it to be a qualifying SPE.
B17
The BIHs other than the transferor, its affiliates, or its agents may have the ability to change the powers of a qualifying SPE.
If the powers of a previously qualifying SPE are changed so that the SPE is no longer qualifying, unless the conditions in paragraph 3856.B5(b) are then met by the SPE itself and the conditions in paragraphs 3856.B5(a) and 3856.B5(c) continue to be met, that change would bring the transferred assets held in the SPE back under the control of the transferor (see paragraph 3856.B50).
B18
A financial asset or derivative financial instrument is passive only if holding the asset or instrument does not involve its holder in making decisions other than the decisions inherent in servicing (see paragraph 3856.B54).
An equity instrument is not passive if the qualifying SPE can exercise the voting rights and is permitted to choose how to vote.
Investments are not passive if through them, either in themselves or in combination with other investments or rights, the SPE or any related entity (such as the transferor, its affiliates, or its agents) is able to exercise control or significant influence (as defined in generally accepted accounting principles for consolidation policy and for the equity method, respectively) over the investee.
A derivative financial instrument is not passive if, for example, it includes an option allowing the SPE to choose to call or put other financial instruments; but other derivative financial instruments can be passive (for example, interest rate caps and swaps and forward contracts).
Derivative financial instruments that result in liabilities, like other liabilities of a qualifying SPE, are a kind of beneficial interest in the qualifying SPE's assets.
B19
A derivative financial instrument pertains to beneficial interests (other than another derivative financial instrument) issued only if it:
when the beneficial interests are issued by the qualifying SPE to parties other than the transferor, its affiliates, or its agents or sold to such other parties after being issued by the qualifying SPE to the transferor, its affiliates, or its agents; or
when a passive derivative financial instrument needs to be replaced upon occurrence of an event or circumstance (specified in the legal documents that established the SPE or created the beneficial interests in the transferred assets that it holds) outside the control of the transferor, its affiliates, or its agents (for example, when the counterparty to the derivative defaults or is downgraded below a specified threshold).
B20
A qualifying SPE may hold non-financial assets other than servicing rights only temporarily and only if those non-financial assets result from collecting the transferred receivables.
For example, a qualifying SPE could be permitted to temporarily hold foreclosed non-financial collateral.
In contrast, an entity cannot be a qualifying SPE if, for example, it receives from a transferor significant secured receivables likely to default with the expectation that it will foreclose on and profitably manage the securing non-financial assets.
A qualifying SPE also may hold the residual value of a sales-type or a direct financing lease only to the extent that it is guaranteed at the inception of the lease either by the lessee or by a third party financially capable of discharging the obligations that may arise from the guarantee (see paragraph 3856.B51).
B21
Examples of requirements to sell, exchange, put, or distribute (hereinafter referred to collectively as dispose of) non-cash financial assets that are permitted activities of a qualifying SPE — because they respond automatically to the occurrence of an event or circumstance that is specified in the legal documents that established the SPE or created the beneficial interests in the transferred assets it holds; is outside the control of the transferor, its affiliates, or its agents; and causes, or is expected to cause, the fair value of those assets to decline by a specified degree below the fair value of those assets when the qualifying SPE obtained them — include requirements to dispose of transferred assets in response to:
B22
The following are examples of powers or requirements to dispose of non-cash financial assets that are not permitted activities of a qualifying SPE, because they do not respond automatically to the occurrence of a specified event or circumstance outside the control of the transferor, its affiliates, or its agents that causes, or is expected to cause, the fair value of those transferred assets to decline by a specified degree below the fair value of those assets when the SPE obtained them:
B23
A qualifying SPE may dispose of transferred assets automatically to the extent necessary to comply with the exercise by a BIH (other than the transferor, its affiliates, or its agents) of its right to put beneficial interests back to the SPE in exchange for:
a full or partial distribution of those assets;
cash (which may require that the SPE dispose of those assets or issue beneficial interests to generate cash to fund settlement of the put); or
new beneficial interests in those assets.
B24
A qualifying SPE may have the power to dispose of assets to a party other than the transferor, its affiliate, or its agent on termination of the SPE or maturity of the beneficial interests, but only automatically on fixed or determinable dates that are specified at inception.
For example, if an SPE is required to dispose of long-term mortgage loans and terminate itself at the earlier of the specified maturity of beneficial interests in those mortgage loans or the date of prepayment of a specified amount of the transferred mortgage loans, the termination date is a fixed or determinable date that was specified at inception.
In contrast, if that SPE has the power to dispose of transferred assets on two specified dates and the SPE can decide which transferred assets to sell on each date, the termination date is not a fixed or determinable date that was specified at inception.
A qualifying SPE is not consolidated in the financial statements of a transferor or its affiliates.
The event that warrants derecognition of receivables transferred to a qualifying SPE is the issuance of beneficial interests in the transferred receivables to third-party BIHs in exchange for cash or other assets.
Once beneficial interests are issued to BIHs other than the transferor or its affiliates in exchange for consideration, the economic benefits of all the receivables held in a qualifying SPE are divided among and controlled by the BIHs, not by the transferor whose assets they once were and not by the qualifying SPE or the trustee that may be the legal owner.
Once the receivables are legally isolated and beneficial interests in those receivables are issued, the qualifying SPE is in the position of a custodian holding the underlying assets for the BIHs.
Receivables held in a qualifying SPE are therefore effectively the assets of its BIHs.
Accordingly, receivables sold to a qualifying SPE are not recognized as assets and related beneficial interests are not recognized as liabilities in consolidated or other financial statements of a transferor, servicer, or sponsor of the SPE.
Any entity having an interest in a SPE, other than a transferor of receivables to a qualifying SPE, or an affiliate of the transferor, needs to consider SUBSIDIARIES, Section 1591, to determine whether it is required to consolidate the SPE in the financial statements being presented.
B26
An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem transferred assets from the transferee maintains the transferor's effective control over those assets under paragraph 3856.B5(c)(i), and the transfer is therefore to be accounted for as a secured borrowing, if and only if all of the following conditions are met:
B27
To be substantially the same, the asset that was transferred and the asset that is to be repurchased or redeemed need to have all of the following characteristics:
B28
To be able to repurchase or redeem assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, a transferor must at all times during the contract term have obtained cash or other collateral sufficient to fund substantially all of the cost of purchasing replacement assets from others.
B29
Some rights to reacquire transferred assets (or to acquire beneficial interests in transferred assets held by a qualifying SPE), regardless of whether they constrain the transferee, may result in the transferor's maintaining effective control over the transferred assets through the unilateral ability to cause the return of specific transferred assets.
Such rights preclude sale accounting under paragraph 3856.B5(c)(ii).
For example, an attached call in itself would not constrain a transferee who is able, by exchanging or pledging the asset subject to that call, to obtain substantially all of its economic benefits.
In contrast, transfers of financial assets subject to calls embedded by the issuers of the financial instruments (for example, callable bonds or prepayable mortgage loans) do not preclude sale accounting.
Such an embedded call does not result in the transferor's maintaining effective control, because it is the issuer rather than the transferor who holds the call.
B30
If the transferee is a qualifying SPE, it has met the conditions in paragraph 3856.B14(d) and therefore must be constrained from choosing to exchange or pledge the transferred assets.
In that circumstance, any call held by the transferor is effectively attached to the assets and could — depending on the price and other terms of the call — maintain the transferor's effective control over transferred assets through the ability to unilaterally cause the transferee to return specific assets.
For example, a transferor's unilateral ability to cause a qualifying SPE to return to the transferor or otherwise dispose of specific transferred assets at will or, for example, in response to its decision to exit a market or a particular activity, could provide the transferor with effective control over the transferred assets.
B31
A call that is attached to transferred assets maintains the transferor's effective control over those assets if, under its price and other terms, the call conveys more than a trivial benefit to the transferor.
Similarly, any unilateral right to reclaim specific assets transferred to a qualifying SPE maintains the transferor's effective control over those assets if the right conveys more than a trivial benefit to the transferor.
A call or other right conveys more than a trivial benefit if the price to be paid is fixed, determinable, or otherwise potentially advantageous, unless because that price is so far out of the money or for other reasons it is probable when the option is written that the transferor will not exercise it.
Thus, for example, a call on specific assets transferred to a qualifying SPE at a price fixed at their principal amount maintains the transferor's effective control over the assets subject to that call.
Effective control over transferred assets can be present even if the right to reclaim is indirect.
For example, if an embedded call allows a transferor to buy back the beneficial interests of a qualifying SPE at a fixed price, then the transferor remains in effective control of the assets underlying those beneficial interests.
A cleanup call, however, is permitted as an exception to that general principle.
B32
A right to reclaim specific transferred assets by paying their fair value when reclaimed generally does not maintain effective control, because it does not convey a more than trivial benefit to the transferor.
However, a transferor has maintained effective control if it has such a right and also holds the residual interest in the transferred assets.
For example, if a transferor can reclaim such assets at termination of the qualifying SPE by purchasing them in an auction, and thus at what might appear to be fair value, then sale accounting for the assets it can reclaim would be precluded.
Such circumstances provide the transferor with a more than trivial benefit and effective control over the assets, because it can pay any price it chooses in the auction and recover any excess paid over fair value through its residual interest.
B33
A transferor that has a right to reacquire transferred assets from a qualifying SPE does not maintain effective control if the reclaimed assets would be randomly selected and the amount of the assets reacquired is sufficiently limited (see paragraph 3856.B36(a)), because that would not be a right to reacquire specific assets.
Nor does a transferor maintain effective control through an obligation to reacquire transferred assets from a qualifying SPE if the transfer could occur only after a specified failure of the servicer to properly service the transferred assets that could result in the loss of a third-party guarantee (see paragraph 3856.B21(a)) or only after a BIH other than the transferor, its affiliate, or its agent requires a qualifying SPE to repurchase that beneficial interest (see paragraph 3856.B23(b)), because the transferor could not cause that reacquisition unilaterally.
B34
Many transfers of receivables in securitizations empower the transferor to reclaim assets subject to certain restrictions.
Such a power is sometimes called a removal-of-accounts provision (ROAP).
Whether a ROAP precludes sale accounting depends on whether the ROAP results in the transferor's maintaining effective control over specific transferred assets (see paragraphs 3856.B5(c)(ii) and 3856.B30-.B33).
B35
The following are examples of ROAPs that preclude transfers from being accounted for as sales:
B36
The following are examples of ROAPs that do not preclude transfers from being accounted for as sales:
B37
A ROAP that can be exercised only in response to a third party's action that has not yet occurred does not maintain the transferor's effective control over assets potentially subject to that ROAP.
However, when a third party's action (such as default or cancellation) or decision not to act (expiration) occurs that allows removal of assets to be initiated solely by the transferor, the transferor recognizes any assets subject to the ROAP, whether the ROAP is exercised or not.
If the ROAP is exercised, the assets are recognized because the transferor has reclaimed the assets.
If the ROAP is not exercised, the assets are recognized because the transferor now can unilaterally cause the qualifying SPE to return those specific assets and, therefore, once again has effective control over those assets (see paragraph 3856.B52).
B38
Upon completion of any transfer of receivables, the transferor:
continues to carry in its balance sheet any retained interest in the transferred assets, including, if applicable, servicing assets (see paragraphs 3856.B54-.B56), beneficial interests in assets transferred to a qualifying SPE (see paragraphs 3856.B48-.B50), and retained undivided interests (see paragraphs 3856.B41-.B43); and
allocates the previous carrying amount between the assets sold, if any, and the retained interests, if any, based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer (see paragraphs 3856.B41-.B43).
B39
Upon completion of a transfer of receivables that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale (see paragraph 3856.B5), the transferor (seller):
derecognizes all assets sold;
recognizes all assets obtained and liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale, including cash, put or call options held or written (for example, guarantee or recourse obligations), forward commitments (for example, commitments to deliver additional receivables during the revolving periods of some securitizations), swaps (for example, provisions that convert interest rates from fixed to variable), and servicing liabilities, if applicable (see paragraphs 3856.B41 and 3856.B54-.B56);
initially measures at fair value assets obtained and liabilities incurred in a sale (see paragraphs 3856.B44-.B46) or, if it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of an asset or a liability, apply alternative measures (see paragraph 3856.B47); and
recognizes in income any gain or loss on the sale.
The transferee recognizes all assets obtained and any liabilities incurred and initially measures them at fair value (in aggregate, presumptively the price paid).
B40
If a transfer of receivables in exchange for cash or other consideration (other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets) does not meet the criteria for a sale in paragraph 3856.B5, the transferor and transferee account for the transfer as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral (see paragraph 3856.B58).
B41
The proceeds from a sale of receivables consist of the cash and any other assets obtained in the transfer less any liabilities incurred.
Any asset obtained that is not an interest in the transferred asset is part of the proceeds from the sale.
Any liability incurred, even if it is related to the transferred assets, is a reduction of the proceeds.
Any derivative financial instrument entered into concurrently with a transfer of receivables is either an asset obtained or a liability incurred and part of the proceeds received in the transfer.
All proceeds and reductions of proceeds from a sale are initially measured at fair value, if practicable.
B42
Interests in transferred assets that are not part of the proceeds of the transfer are retained interests over which the transferor has not relinquished control.
They are measured at the date of the transfer by allocating the previous carrying amount between the assets sold, if any, and the retained interests, based on their relative fair values.
Allocation procedures are applied to all transfers in which interests are retained, even those that do not qualify as sales.
Examples of retained interests include securities backed by the transferred assets, undivided interests, servicing assets, and cash reserve accounts and residual interests in securitization trusts.
If a transferor cannot determine whether an asset is a retained interest or proceeds from the sale, the asset is treated as proceeds from the sale and accounted for in accordance with paragraph 3856.B41.
B43
If the retained interests are subordinated to more senior interests held by others, that subordination may concentrate into the retained interests most of the risks inherent in the transferred assets and is taken into consideration in estimating the fair value of the retained interests.
For example, if the amount of the gain recognized, after allocation, on a securitization with a subordinated retained interest is greater than the gain would have been had the entire asset been sold, the transferor needs to be able to identify why that can occur.
Otherwise, it is likely that the impact of the retained interest being subordinate to a senior interest has not been adequately considered in the determination of the fair value of the subordinated retained interest.
B44
Paragraphs 3856.B45-.B47 provide guidance on determination of fair value for the purposes of accounting for a transfer of receivables only.
B45
Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available.
If a quoted market price is available, the fair value is the product of the number of trading units times that market price.
If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The estimate of fair value takes into account prices for similar assets and liabilities and the results of valuation techniques to the extent available in the circumstances.
Examples of valuation techniques include the present value of estimated expected future cash flows, option-pricing models, matrix pricing, option-adjusted spread models, and fundamental analysis.
Valuation techniques used for measuring financial assets and liabilities and servicing assets and liabilities are consistent with the objective of measuring fair value.
Those techniques incorporate assumptions that market participants use in their estimates of values, future revenues and future expenses, including assumptions about interest rates, default, prepayment and volatility.
The timing and amount of future cash flows for retained interests in securitizations are commonly uncertain, especially if those interests are subordinate to more senior beneficial interests.
Applying the present value approach depends heavily on assumptions about default and prepayment of all the assets securitized, because of the implicit credit or prepayment risk enhancement arising from the subordination.
In measuring financial liabilities and servicing liabilities at fair value, the objective is to estimate the value of the assets required currently to settle the liability with the holder or to transfer a liability to an entity of comparable credit standing.
B46
Estimates of expected future cash flows, if used to estimate fair value, are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections.
All available evidence is considered in developing estimates of expected future cash flows.
The weight to be given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be verified objectively.
If a range is estimated for either the amount or timing of possible cash flows, the likelihood of possible outcomes is considered either directly, if applying an expected cash flow approach, or indirectly through the risk-adjusted discount rate, if determining the best estimate of future cash flows.
B47
If it is not practicable to estimate the fair values of assets, the transferor records those assets at zero.
If it is not practicable to estimate the fair values of liabilities, the transferor recognizes no gain on the transaction and records those liabilities at the greater of:
the excess, if any, of the fair values of assets obtained less the fair values of other liabilities incurred, over the sum of the carrying values of the assets transferred; and
the amount that would be recognized in accordance with CONTINGENCIES, Section 3290.
B48
The value of the forward contract implicit in a revolving-period securitization arises from the difference between the agreed-upon rate of return to investors on their beneficial interests in a pool of receivables or a trust and current market rates of return on similar investments.
If a forward contract to sell receivables is entered into at the market rate, its value at inception may be zero.
Changes in the fair value of the forward contract are likely to be greater if the investors receive a fixed rate than if the investors receive a rate that varies based on changes in market rates.
B49
Gain or loss recognition for revolving-period receivable securitizations is limited to receivables that exist and have been sold.
Recognition of servicing assets or liabilities for revolving-period receivables is similarly limited to the servicing for the receivables that exist and have been transferred.
As new receivables are sold, rights to service them become assets or liabilities and are recognized.
B50
Certain revolving-period securitizations use either a discrete purchase or trust structure for a single securitization, or a master trust structure for many securitizations.
To achieve another securitization using an existing master trust or co-ownership structure, a transferor may first transfer additional receivables to the trust or to the custodian for the benefit of the co-owners and then sell to investors additional ownership interests in the trust or the pool of receivables.
Adding receivables to a master trust or transferring receivables to a custodian, in itself, is neither a sale nor a secured borrowing under paragraph 3856.B5, because that transfer only increases the transferor's beneficial interest in the assets of the trust or the co-ownership pool.
A sale or secured borrowing does not occur until the transferor receives consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets.
Transfers that result in an exchange of cash (i.e., either transfers that in essence replace previously transferred receivables that have been collected or sales of beneficial interests to outside investors), are transfers in exchange for consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets and thus are accounted for as sales (if they satisfy all the criteria in paragraph 3856.B5) or as secured borrowings.
Sales-type and direct financing receivables secured by leased equipment, referred to as gross investment in lease receivables, are made up of two components: minimum lease payments and residual values.
Minimum lease payments are requirements for lessees to pay cash to lessors and meet the definition of a financial asset.
Thus, transfers of minimum lease payments are subject to the requirements of this Appendix.
Residual values represent the lessor's estimate of the "salvage" value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term and may be either guaranteed or unguaranteed; residual values meet the definition of financial assets to the extent that they are guaranteed at the inception of the lease.
Thus, transfers of residual values guaranteed at inception also are subject to the requirements of this Appendix.
Unguaranteed residual values do not meet the definition of financial assets, nor do residual values guaranteed after inception, and transfers of them are not subject to the requirements of this Appendix.
Entities securitizing lease financing receivables allocate the gross investment in receivables between minimum lease payments, residual values guaranteed at inception, and residual values not guaranteed at inception using the individual carrying amounts of those components at the date of transfer.
Those entities also record a servicing asset or liability in accordance with paragraphs 3856.B38 and 3856.B53, if appropriate.
A change in law, status of the transferee as a qualifying SPE, or other circumstance may result in the transferor regaining control of assets previously accounted for appropriately as having been sold, because one or more of the conditions in paragraph 3856.B5 are no longer met.
Such a change, unless it arises solely from either the initial application of this Appendix or a change in market prices (for example, an increase in price that moves into-the-money a freestanding call that was originally sufficiently out-of-the-money that it was judged not to constrain the transferee), is accounted for in the same manner as a purchase of the assets from the former transferee(s) in exchange for liabilities assumed (see paragraph 3856.B33.
The transferor initially measures those assets and liabilities at fair value on the date of the change, as if the transferor purchased the assets and assumed the liabilities on that date.
The former transferee would derecognize the assets on that date, as if it had sold the assets in exchange for a receivable from the transferor.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF SERVICING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
B53
Each time an entity undertakes an obligation to service receivables it recognizes either a servicing asset or a servicing liability for that servicing contract, unless it securitizes the assets, retains all of the resulting securities, and classifies them as assets measured on other than a fair value basis.
If the servicing asset or liability was purchased or assumed rather than undertaken in a sale or securitization of the receivables being serviced, it is measured initially at its fair value, presumptively the price paid.
A servicing asset or liability is amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income (if servicing revenues exceed servicing costs) or net servicing loss (if servicing costs exceed servicing revenues).
A servicing asset or liability is assessed for impairment or increased obligation based on its fair value (see paragraphs 3856.B54-.B56).
B54
Servicing of mortgage loans, credit card receivables, or other receivables commonly includes, but is not limited to, collecting principal, interest, and escrow payments from borrowers; paying taxes and insurance from escrowed funds; monitoring delinquencies; executing foreclosure if necessary; temporarily investing funds pending distribution; remitting fees to guarantors, trustees, and others providing services; and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to the holders of beneficial interests in the receivables.
Servicing is inherent in all receivables; it becomes a distinct asset or liability only when contractually separated from the underlying assets by sale or securitization of the assets with servicing retained or separate purchase or assumption of the servicing.
B55
An entity that undertakes a contract to service receivables recognizes either a servicing asset or a servicing liability, unless the transferor securitizes the assets and retains all of the resulting securities, in which case the servicing asset or liability may be reported together with the asset being serviced.
Each securitization with servicing retained or separate purchase or assumption of servicing results in a servicing contract.
A servicer of receivables commonly receives the benefits of servicing — revenues from contractually specified servicing fees, late charges, and other ancillary sources, including "float", all of which it is entitled to receive only if it performs the servicing — and incurs the costs of servicing the assets.
Each servicing contract results in a servicing asset or servicing liability.
The benefits of servicing may be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, in which case the contract results in a servicing asset.
However, if the benefits of servicing are not expected to adequately compensate the servicer for performing the servicing, the contract results in a servicing liability.
(A servicing asset may become a servicing liability, or vice versa, if circumstances change, and the initial measure for servicing may be zero if the benefits of servicing are just adequate to compensate the servicer for its servicing responsibilities.)
B56
A servicer that recognizes a servicing asset or servicing liability accounts for the contract to service receivables separately from those assets, as follows:
Those rights are not servicing assets; they are financial assets, effectively interest-only strips to be accounted for in accordance with paragraph 3856.B57 of this Appendix.
Those characteristics may include receivable type, size, interest rate, date of origination, term, and geographic location.
The amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of servicing assets for a stratum exceeds their fair value.
The fair value of servicing assets that have not been recognized are not used in the evaluation of impairment.
(iii) Adjust the valuation allowance to reflect changes in the measurement of impairment subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment.
Fair value in excess of the carrying amount of servicing assets for that stratum, however, is not recognized.
This Appendix does not address when an entity records a direct write-down of recognized servicing assets (see paragraph 3856.B53).
However, if subsequent events have increased the fair value of the liability above the carrying amount, for example, because of significant changes in the amount or timing of actual or expected future cash flows from the cash flows previously projected, the servicer revises its earlier estimates and recognizes the increased obligation as a loss in income (see paragraph 3856.B53).
MEASUREMENT OF RETAINED INTERESTS SUBSEQUENT TO A TRANSFER ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SALE
Subsequent to a transfer accounted for as a sale, an entity analyzes the substance of any retained interest in the transferred assets and accounts for that interest as a loan or an investment in accordance with its established accounting policies or generally accepted practices for assets of a similar nature.
An entity discloses any significant accounting policies applied in accounting for a retained interest and, at each period end, applies the relevant test for impairment in its carrying amount.
SECURED BORROWINGS
When a transaction is accounted for as a secured borrowing, an entity continues to account for transferred assets after the transaction on the same basis as beforehand, and accounts for the secured borrowing in accordance with its established accounting policies for liabilities of a similar nature or generally accepted practices for secured borrowings.

INITIAL MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN A RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION
Company A advances $100,000 cash to Company B, a related party, and receives as consideration a note receivable.
The note receivable:
is not quoted in an active market;
does not have inputs that are significant to the determination of the fair value of the instrument that are observable;
has a face amount of $100,000; and
does not have a maturity date or stated terms of repayment.

The debt instrument does not have inputs that are significant to the determination of the fair value of the instrument that are observable therefore, the instrument is initially measured at cost.
Company C received common shares in Company D, a related party, as consideration for land transferred from Company C to Company D. Companies C and D are under the common control of Company E. The carrying amount of the land in the accounts of Company C is $250,000 and the land's exchange amount is $300,000.
The common shares of Company D are not quoted in an active market.
Entries by Company C (Seller)
Situation I — The financial instrument is initially measured at the carrying amount of the consideration transferred in the transaction
Situation II — The financial instrument is initially measured at the exchange amount of the consideration transferred in the transaction

In Situations I and II, the shares of Company D are not quoted in an active market and do not have repayment terms; therefore, the cost of the investment in Company D is initially measured by Company C at the carrying or exchange amount of the land transferred as consideration for the investment in accordance with the guidance in paragraphs 3856.08-.08B.
In Situation II, the gain is included in net income because the related party transaction includes a financial instrument, and is either in the normal course of operations, or is not in the normal course of operations and meets the criteria in paragraphs 3856.08E(a)-(c).
Company F transferred a trade receivable and land to Company G, a related party.
As consideration for the transaction, Company F received common shares in Company G and a note receivable from Company G. The common shares of Company G are not quoted in an active market and have an assigned value of $25,000.
The face amount of the trade receivable is $100,000 and there were no previously recognized impairments.
The carrying amount of the land in the accounts of Company F is $45,000 and the land's exchange amount is $65,000.
The terms of the note receivable from Company G are:
the note is not quoted in an active market;
the face amount of the note is $120,000;
the note is due in five years; and
the interest rate on the note is 7 percent.
Entries by Company F (Seller)
Situation I — The Investment in Company G is initially measured at the carrying amount of consideration transferred by Company F in the transaction.
The note receivable due from Company G is initially measured at the undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest and dividend payments of the instrument
Situation II — The Investment in Company G is initially measured at the exchange amount of the consideration transferred by Company F in the transaction.

Trade receivable
To record receipt of the investment in G and the note receivable, and the sale of the land and transfer of the trade receivable.
In Situations I and II, the note receivable issued by Company G is not quoted in an active market and does not have inputs that are significant to the determination of the fair value of the instrument that are observable.
The note receivable does have repayment terms; therefore, its cost is determined using the undiscounted cash flows of the instrument, excluding interest and dividend payments.
The shares of Company G are also not quoted in an active market and have no repayment terms.
Therefore, the cost of this instrument is determined using the consideration transferred.
The consideration transferred in this transaction includes a trade receivable and land.
The cost of the trade receivable transferred in the transaction is $100,000, which reflects the undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest and dividend payments, of the instrument.
In Situation I, the value of the land portion of the consideration transferred in the transaction is $45,000, which reflects the carrying amount of the land in Company F's accounts. Therefore, the total consideration transferred in Situation I in exchange for the investment in Company G and note receivable from Company G is $145,000.
The cost of the note receivable from Company G is $120,000.
Therefore, Company F initially measures its investment in Company G at the total consideration transferred less the cost of the note receivable in Company G ($145,000 – $120,000 = $25,000).
In Situation II, the value of the land portion of the consideration transferred is $65,000, which reflects its exchange amount.
Therefore, the total consideration transferred in Situation II in exchange for the investment in Company G and note receivable from Company G is $165,000.
Therefore, Company F initially measures its investment in Company G at the total consideration transferred less the cost of the note receivable in Company G ($165,000 – $120,000 = $45,000).
Furthermore, the gain is included in income because the transaction includes a financial instrument, and is either in the normal course of operations, or is not in the normal course of operations and meets the criteria in paragraphs 3856.08E(a)-(c).

In Situations I and II, neither the note payable or trade receivable have inputs that are significant to the determination of the fair value of the instrument that are observable.
Furthermore, the trade receivable is not quoted in an active market.
Both instruments have stated payment terms.
Therefore, the cost of the note payable and trade receivable is determined using the undiscounted cash flows of the instrument, excluding interest and dividend payments.
The land is recognized in Company G's accounts at the predecessor's carrying amount or the land's exchange amount in accordance with RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, Section 3840.
The common shares are measured at the value assigned by Company G.
In Situation II, the gain is included in net income because the related party transaction includes financial instruments, and is either in the normal course of operations, or is not in the normal course of operations and meets the criteria in paragraphs 3856.08E(a)-(c).
Company H sold land to Company I in return for a debt instrument issued by Company I. Company H and I are related parties.
The carrying amount of the land in the accounts of Company H is $500,000 and the land's exchange amount is $550,000.
The debt instrument issued by Company I is not quoted in an active market, but the instrument does have inputs that are significant to the determination of fair value that are observable.
At issuance, the fair value of the debt instrument in Company I was $525,000.
The transaction is not in the normal course of operations.
Entries by Company H (Seller)
Situation I — The transaction is not in the normal course of operations and meets the criteria in paragraphs 3856.08E(a)-(c)
Situation II — The transaction is not in the normal course of operations and does not meet the criteria in paragraphs 3856.08E(a)-(c)

In Situations I and II, the debt instrument is not quoted in an active market, but the instrument does have inputs that are significant to the determination of fair value that are observable.
Therefore, the debt instrument is initially measured at fair value.
In Situation I, the gain is included in net income because the transaction includes a financial instrument, and is either in the normal course of operations, or is not in the normal course of operations and meets the criteria in paragraphs 3856.08E(a)-(c).
In Situation II, the difference is included in equity because the transaction includes a financial instrument, is not in the normal course of operations and does not meet the criteria in paragraphs 3856.08E(a)-(c).

In Situation I, the difference is included in equity because the transaction includes a financial instrument, is not in the normal course of operations and does not meet the criteria in paragraphs 3856.08E(a)-(c).
In Situation II, the gain is included in net income because the transaction includes a financial instrument, and is either in the normal course of operations, or is not in the normal course of operations and meets the criteria in paragraphs 3856.08E(a)-(c).
RETRACTABLE OR MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SHARES ISSUED IN A TAX PLANNING ARRANGEMENT
The following example illustrates how the accounting treatment specified in paragraph 3856.23 might be applied in a particular situation.
Matters of principle relating to particular situations should be decided in the context of paragraph 3856.23.
Shareholder A owns 70 percent of the voting shares and Shareholder B owns 30 percent of the voting shares of Corporation A. Shareholder B executes a tax planning arrangement exchanging their common shares for retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares as below:
The retractable or mandatorily redeemable shares issued by Corporation A to Shareholder B would not qualify for equity classification as Shareholder B did not retain control of Corporation A. Therefore, the shares are classified as a financial liability at the redemption amount.
Debt instruments without stated terms of repayment are deemed payable on demand.

Objective
The objective of this Standard is to ensure that appropriate recognition criteria and measurement bases are applied to provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets and that sufficient information is disclosed in the notes to enable users to understand their nature, timing and amount.
Scope
those covered by another Standard.
For example, some types of provisions are addressed in Standards on:
income taxes (see IAS 12 Income Taxes);
leases (see IFRS 16 Leases).
However, this Standard applies to any lease that becomes onerous before the commencement date of the lease as defined in IFRS 16.
This Standard also applies to short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value accounted for in accordance with paragraph 6 of IFRS 16 and that have become onerous;
employee benefits (see IAS 19 Employee Benefits);
insurance contracts (see IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts).
However, this Standard applies to provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets of an insurer, other than those arising from its contractual obligations and rights under insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 4;
contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination (see IFRS 3 Business Combinations); and
revenue from contracts with customers (see IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers).
However, as IFRS 15 contains no specific requirements to address contracts with customers that are, or have become, onerous, this Standard applies to such cases.
These issues are not addressed in this Standard.
Accordingly, this Standard neither prohibits nor requires capitalisation of the costs recognised when a provision is made.
When a restructuring meets the definition of a discontinued operation, additional disclosures may be required by IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount.
A liability is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.
An obligating event is an event that creates a legal or constructive obligation that results in an entity having no realistic alternative to settling that obligation.
A legal obligation is an obligation that derives from:
a contract (through its explicit or implicit terms);
legislation; or
other operation of law.
A constructive obligation is an obligation that derives from an entity's actions where:
by an established pattern of past practice, published policies or a sufficiently specific current statement, the entity has indicated to other parties that it will accept certain responsibilities; and
as a result, the entity has created a valid expectation on the part of those other parties that it will discharge those responsibilities.
A contingent liability is:
a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or
(ii)
the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
A restructuring is a programme that is planned and controlled by management, and materially changes either:
the scope of a business undertaken by an entity; or
the manner in which that business is conducted.
By contrast:
trade payables are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied and have been invoiced or formally agreed with the supplier; and
accruals are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied but have not been paid, invoiced or formally agreed with the supplier, including amounts due to employees (for example, amounts relating to accrued vacation pay).
Although it is sometimes necessary to estimate the amount or timing of accruals, the uncertainty is generally much less than for provisions.
Accruals are often reported as part of trade and other payables, whereas provisions are reported separately.
In addition, the term 'contingent liability' is used for liabilities that do not meet the recognition criteria.
provisions – which are recognised as liabilities (assuming that a reliable estimate can be made) because they are present obligations and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations; and
contingent liabilities – which are not recognised as liabilities because they are either:
possible obligations, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits; or
present obligations that do not meet the recognition criteria in this Standard (because either it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made).
an entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If these conditions are not met, no provision shall be recognised.
In these cases, a past event is deemed to give rise to a present obligation if, taking account of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that a present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period.
In rare cases, for example in a lawsuit, it may be disputed either whether certain events have occurred or whether those events result in a present obligation.
In such a case, an entity determines whether a present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period by taking account of all available evidence, including, for example, the opinion of experts.
The evidence considered includes any additional evidence provided by events after the reporting period.
On the basis of such evidence:
where it is more likely than not that a present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period, the entity recognises a provision (if the recognition criteria are met); and
where it is more likely that no present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period, the entity discloses a contingent liability, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote (see paragraph 86).
For an event to be an obligating event, it is necessary that the entity has no realistic alternative to settling the obligation created by the event.
This is the case only:
where the settlement of the obligation can be enforced by law; or
in the case of a constructive obligation, where the event (which may be an action of the entity) creates valid expectations in other parties that the entity will discharge the obligation.
Therefore, no provision is recognised for costs that need to be incurred to operate in the future.
The only liabilities recognised in an entity's statement of financial position are those that exist at the end of the reporting period.
Examples of such obligations are penalties or clean-up costs for unlawful environmental damage, both of which would lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement regardless of the future actions of the entity.
Similarly, an entity recognises a provision for the decommissioning costs of an oil installation or a nuclear power station to the extent that the entity is obliged to rectify damage already caused.
Because the entity can avoid the future expenditure by its future actions, for example by changing its method of operation, it has no present obligation for that future expenditure and no provision is recognised.
It is not necessary, however, to know the identity of the party to whom the obligation is owed — indeed the obligation may be to the public at large.
Because an obligation always involves a commitment to another party, it follows that a management or board decision does not give rise to a constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period unless the decision has been communicated before the end of the reporting period to those affected by it in a sufficiently specific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will discharge its responsibilities.
For example, when environmental damage is caused there may be no obligation to remedy the consequences.
However, the causing of the damage will become an obligating event when a new law requires the existing damage to be rectified or when the entity publicly accepts responsibility for rectification in a way that creates a constructive obligation.
For the purpose of this Standard, such an obligation is treated as a legal obligation.
Differences in circumstances surrounding enactment make it impossible to specify a single event that would make the enactment of a law virtually certain.
In many cases it will be impossible to be virtually certain of the enactment of a law until it is enacted.
For the purpose of this Standard, {§2} 2 an outflow of resources or other event is regarded as probable if the event is more likely than not to occur, ie the probability that the event will occur is greater than the probability that it will not.
Where it is not probable that a present obligation exists, an entity discloses a contingent liability, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote (see paragraph 86).
Although the likelihood of outflow for any one item may be small, it may well be probable that some outflow of resources will be needed to settle the class of obligations as a whole.
If that is the case, a provision is recognised (if the other recognition criteria are met).
This is especially true in the case of provisions, which by their nature are more uncertain than most other items in the statement of financial position.
Except in extremely rare cases, an entity will be able to determine a range of possible outcomes and can therefore make an estimate of the obligation that is sufficiently reliable to use in recognising a provision.
That liability is disclosed as a contingent liability (see paragraph 86).
The entity recognises a provision for the part of the obligation for which an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is probable, except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made.
Therefore, they are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits has become probable.
If it becomes probable that an outflow of future economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change in probability occurs (except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made).
An example is a claim that an entity is pursuing through legal processes, where the outcome is uncertain.
If it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change occurs.
If an inflow of economic benefits has become probable, an entity discloses the contingent asset (see paragraph 89).
It will often be impossible or prohibitively expensive to settle or transfer an obligation at the end of the reporting period.
However, the estimate of the amount that an entity would rationally pay to settle or transfer the obligation gives the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.
Where the provision being measured involves a large population of items, the obligation is estimated by weighting all possible outcomes by their associated probabilities.
The name for this statistical method of estimation is 'expected value'.
The provision will therefore be different depending on whether the probability of a loss of a given amount is, for example, 60 per cent or 90 per cent.
Where there is a continuous range of possible outcomes, and each point in that range is as likely as any other, the mid-point of the range is used.
Example
An entity sells goods with a warranty under which customers are covered for the cost of repairs of any manufacturing defects that become apparent within the first six months after purchase.
If minor defects were detected in all products sold, repair costs of 1 million would result.
If major defects were detected in all products sold, repair costs of 4 million would result.
The entity's past experience and future expectations indicate that, for the coming year, 75 per cent of the goods sold will have no defects, 20 per cent of the goods sold will have minor defects and 5 per cent of the goods sold will have major defects.
In accordance with paragraph 24, an entity assesses the probability of an outflow for the warranty obligations as a whole.
The expected value of the cost of repairs is:
(75% of nil) + (20% of 1m) + (5% of 4m) = 400,000
However, even in such a case, the entity considers other possible outcomes.
Where other possible outcomes are either mostly higher or mostly lower than the most likely outcome, the best estimate will be a higher or lower amount.
For example, if an entity has to rectify a serious fault in a major plant that it has constructed for a customer, the individual most likely outcome may be for the repair to succeed at the first attempt at a cost of 1,000, but a provision for a larger amount is made if there is a significant chance that further attempts will be necessary.
A risk adjustment may increase the amount at which a liability is measured.
Caution is needed in making judgements under conditions of uncertainty, so that income or assets are not overstated and expenses or liabilities are not understated.
However, uncertainty does not justify the creation of excessive provisions or a deliberate overstatement of liabilities.
For example, if the projected costs of a particularly adverse outcome are estimated on a prudent basis, that outcome is not then deliberately treated as more probable than is realistically the case.
Care is needed to avoid duplicating adjustments for risk and uncertainty with consequent overstatement of a provision.
Provisions are therefore discounted, where the effect is material.
For example, an entity may believe that the cost of cleaning up a site at the end of its life will be reduced by future changes in technology.
The amount recognised reflects a reasonable expectation of technically qualified, objective observers, taking account of all available evidence as to the technology that will be available at the time of the clean-up.
Thus it is appropriate to include, for example, expected cost reductions associated with increased experience in applying existing technology or the expected cost of applying existing technology to a larger or more complex clean-up operation than has previously been carried out.
However, an entity does not anticipate the development of a completely new technology for cleaning up unless it is supported by sufficient objective evidence.
The variety of circumstances that arise in practice makes it impossible to specify a single event that will provide sufficient, objective evidence in every case.
In many cases sufficient objective evidence will not exist until the new legislation is enacted.
Instead, an entity recognises gains on expected disposals of assets at the time specified by the Standard dealing with the assets concerned.
Reimbursements
The reimbursement shall be treated as a separate asset.
The amount recognised for the reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of the provision.
The other party may either reimburse amounts paid by the entity or pay the amounts directly.
In this situation, a provision is recognised for the full amount of the liability, and a separate asset for the expected reimbursement is recognised when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the liability.
In such a case the entity has no liability for those costs and they are not included in the provision.
Changes in provisions
If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision shall be reversed.
This increase is recognised as borrowing cost.
Setting expenditures against a provision that was originally recognised for another purpose would conceal the impact of two different events.
Application of the recognition and measurement rules
An entity tests these assets for impairment under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Other contracts establish both rights and obligations for each of the contracting parties.
Where events make such a contract onerous, the contract falls within the scope of this Standard and a liability exists which is recognised.
The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it.
sale or termination of a line of business;
the closure of business locations in a country or region or the relocation of business activities from one country or region to another;
changes in management structure, for example, eliminating a layer of management; and
fundamental reorganisations that have a material effect on the nature and focus of the entity's operations.
Paragraphs 72–83 set out how the general recognition criteria apply to restructurings.
has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring identifying at least:
the business or part of a business concerned;
the principal locations affected;
(iii) the location, function, and approximate number of employees who will be compensated for terminating their services;
(iv) the expenditures that will be undertaken; and
when the plan will be implemented; and
has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
A public announcement of a detailed plan to restructure constitutes a constructive obligation to restructure only if it is made in such a way and in sufficient detail (ie setting out the main features of the plan) that it gives rise to valid expectations in other parties such as customers, suppliers and employees (or their representatives) that the entity will carry out the restructuring.
If it is expected that there will be a long delay before the restructuring begins or that the restructuring will take an unreasonably long time, it is unlikely that the plan will raise a valid expectation on the part of others that the entity is at present committed to restructuring, because the timeframe allows opportunities for the entity to change its plans.
started to implement the restructuring plan; or
announced the main features of the restructuring plan to those affected by it in a sufficiently specific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will carry out the restructuring.
If an entity starts to implement a restructuring plan, or announces its main features to those affected, only after the reporting period, disclosure is required under IAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period, if the restructuring is material and non-disclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.
For example, negotiations with employee representatives for termination payments, or with purchasers for the sale of an operation, may have been concluded subject only to board approval.
Once that approval has been obtained and communicated to the other parties, the entity has a constructive obligation to restructure, if the conditions of paragraph 72 are met.
Because a decision by such a board involves communication to these representatives, it may result in a constructive obligation to restructure.
Until there is a binding sale agreement, the entity will be able to change its mind and indeed will have to take another course of action if a purchaser cannot be found on acceptable terms.
When the sale of an operation is envisaged as part of a restructuring, the assets of the operation are reviewed for impairment, under IAS 36.

an indication of the uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of any outflow; and
the possibility of any reimbursement.
Thus, it may be appropriate to treat as a single class of provision amounts relating to warranties of different products, but it would not be appropriate to treat as a single class amounts relating to normal warranties and amounts that are subject to legal proceedings.
In such cases, an entity need not disclose the information, but shall disclose the general nature of the dispute, together with the fact that, and reason why, the information has not been disclosed.

Appendix
This Section establishes standards for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of liabilities for asset retirement obligations and the associated asset retirement costs.
This Section applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset, including productive biological assets, that result from its acquisition, construction, development or normal operation.
This Section covers the obligations of both lessors and lessees in connection with leased assets, whether imposed by a lease agreement or by a party other than the lessor, except for those obligations of a lessee that meet the definition of either minimum lease payments or contingent rentals in LEASES, Section 3065, and are accounted for in accordance with that Section.
This Section also covers obligations arising in connection with leasing and other agreements concerning the rights to explore for or exploit natural resources, to which LEASES, Section 3065, does not apply.
This Section does not apply to:
obligations that arise solely from a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of a long-lived asset subject to DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, Section 3475; and
obligations that result from the improper operation of an asset.
the promise or assurance was intended to affect a contract or other legal relationship between the promisor and the promisee, and to be acted on; and
the promisee acted on the promise or assurance, or in some way changed its position.
An entity shall recognize a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred when a reasonable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
If a reasonable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability shall be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
FINANCIAL STATEMENT CONCEPTS, Section 1000, defines liabilities as obligations of an entity arising from past transactions or events, the settlement of which may result in the transfer or use of assets, provision of services or other yielding of economic benefits in the future.
Liabilities have three essential characteristics:
they embody a duty or responsibility to others that entails settlement by future transfer or use of assets, provision of services or other yielding of economic benefits, at a specified or determinable date, on occurrence of a specified event, or on demand;
the duty or responsibility obligates the entity, leaving it little or no discretion to avoid it; and
the transaction or event obligating the entity has already occurred.
Only a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset, including an obligation created by promissory estoppel, establishes a clear duty or responsibility to another party that justifies recognition of a liability.
Various accounting standards deal with uncertainty in different ways.
CONTINGENCIES, Section 3290, deals with uncertainty about whether a loss has been incurred by setting forth criteria to determine when to recognize a loss contingency.
This Section provides a measurement technique to deal with uncertainties about the amount and timing of the future cash flows necessary to settle a liability.
This Section requires that all asset retirement obligations within its scope be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
When a tangible long-lived asset with an existing asset retirement obligation is acquired, a liability for that obligation is recognized at the asset's acquisition date as if that obligation were incurred on that date.
The amount recognized as an asset retirement obligation shall be the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
The best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation is the amount that an entity would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date or to transfer it to a third party at that time.
It will often be impossible or prohibitively expensive to settle or transfer an obligation at the balance sheet date.
However, the estimate of the amount that an entity would rationally pay to settle or transfer the obligation gives the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
The estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation is determined by the judgment of the management of the entity, supplemented by experience of similar transactions and, in some cases, reports from independent experts.
Future events that may affect the amount required to settle an obligation are reflected in its measurement when there is sufficient objective evidence that they will occur.
Expected future events may be particularly important in measuring an asset retirement obligation.
The amount recognized reflects a reasonable expectation of technically qualified, objective observers, taking account of all available evidence as to the technology that will be available at the time of the clean-up.
Thus, it is appropriate to include expected cost reductions associated with increased experience in applying existing technology, or the expected cost of applying existing technology to a larger or more complex cleanup operation than has previously been carried out.
However, an entity does not anticipate the development of a completely new technology for cleaning up unless it is supported by sufficient objective evidence.
The effect of possible new legislation is taken into consideration in measuring an existing obligation when sufficient objective evidence exists that the legislation is virtually certain to be enacted.
The variety of circumstances that arise in practice makes it impossible to specify a single event that will provide sufficient, objective evidence in every case.
In many cases, sufficient objective evidence will not exist until the new legislation is enacted.
A present value technique is often the best available technique with which to estimate the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
When a present value technique is used, an entity estimates future cash flows used in that technique on a basis consistent with the objective of measuring the asset retirement obligation.
Uncertainties surrounding the amount to be recognized as an asset retirement obligation are incorporated in the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation.
Paragraphs 3110.A23-.A25 provide more detail on the use of a present value technique.
Asset retirement obligations are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Changes in an asset retirement obligation may be due to the passage of time or to revisions to the timing or amount of cash flows, or to the interest rate used in determining the best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
RECOGNITION AND ALLOCATION OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT COST
Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an entity shall recognize an asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount as the liability.
An entity shall subsequently allocate that asset retirement cost to expense using a systematic and rational method over its useful life.
Application of a systematic and rational allocation method does not preclude an entity from capitalizing an amount of asset retirement cost and allocating an equal amount to expense in the same accounting period.
For example, assume an entity acquires a long-lived asset with an estimated life of 10 years.
As that asset is operated, the entity incurs additional asset retirement obligations of equal amount each year.
Application of a systematic and rational allocation method would not preclude that entity from capitalizing and then expensing the asset retirement costs incurred each year.
Impairment of asset retirement costs is accounted for in accordance with IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, Section 3063.
In periods subsequent to initial measurement, an entity shall recognize period-to-period changes in the liability for an asset retirement obligation resulting from:
the passage of time; and
revisions to either the timing, the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows or the discount rate.
An entity shall measure and incorporate changes due to the passage of time into the carrying amount of the liability before measuring changes resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows.
An entity measures changes in the liability for an asset retirement obligation due to passage of time by applying an interest method of allocation to the amount of the liability at the beginning of the period.
The interest rate used to measure that change is the discount rate applied to measure the liability at the beginning of the period.
That amount is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and an expense.
The expense is classified as an operating item in the income statement, not as interest expense.
It is referred to in this Section as "accretion expense", but an entity may use any descriptor as long as it conveys the underlying nature of the expense.
Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows, or revisions to the discount rate, are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the carrying amount of the liability for an asset retirement obligation, and the related asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
When asset retirement costs change as a result of a revision to estimated cash flows, an entity adjusts the amount of asset retirement cost allocated to expense in the period of change if the change affects that period only, or in the period of change and future periods if the change affects more than one period (as required by ACCOUNTING CHANGES, Section 1506, for a change in estimate).
Changes in asset retirement costs that affect future periods will result in adjustments of capitalized asset retirement costs and will affect subsequent depreciation of the related asset.
Such adjustments are depreciated on a prospective basis.
EFFECTS OF FUNDING AND ASSURANCE PROVISIONS
Providing assurance that an entity will be able to satisfy its asset retirement obligation does not satisfy or extinguish the related liability.
Methods of providing assurance include surety bonds, insurance policies, letters of credit, guarantees by other entities, and establishment of trust funds or identification of other assets dedicated to satisfy the asset retirement obligation.
Setting assets aside to satisfy an asset retirement obligation does not satisfy the criteria for offsetting the assets and the liability on the balance sheet.
For a previously recognized asset retirement obligation, changes in funding and assurance provisions have no effect on the measurement of that liability.
Costs associated with complying with funding or assurance provisions are accounted for separately from the asset retirement obligation.
An entity shall disclose the following information about its asset retirement obligations:
a general description of the asset retirement obligations and the associated long-lived assets;
the amount of the asset retirement obligation at the end of the year;
the total amount paid towards the liability during the year; and
if readily determinable, the fair value of assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. If this is not readily determinable, the carrying amount of assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations.
When a reasonable estimate of the amount of an asset retirement obligation cannot be made, that fact and the reasons therefor shall be disclosed.
Uncertainties affecting the measurement of a liability for asset retirement obligations are disclosed in accordance with MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY, Section 1508.
Except as specified in paragraph 3110.26, this Section applies to annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011.
AGRICULTURE, Section 3041, issued in November 2019, amended paragraph 3110.02.

Presentation of cash flows — settlement of a liability
This Section applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset.
For purposes of this Section, a legal obligation can result from:
a government action, such as a law, statute or ordinance;
an agreement between entities, such as a written or oral contract; or
a promise conveyed to a third party that imposes a reasonable expectation of performance upon the promisor under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
An asset retirement obligation is a requirement to perform certain procedures rather than a promise to pay cash or other financial assets to the party to whom the obligation is owed.
Accordingly, an asset retirement obligation is not a financial liability and is not subject to FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, Section 3856.
The Supreme Court of Canada has described promissory estoppel as follows.
The principles of promissory estoppel are well settled.
The party relying on the doctrine must establish that the other party has, by words or conduct, made a promise or assurance which was intended to affect their legal relationship and to be acted on.
Furthermore, the representee must establish that, in reliance on the representation, he acted on it or in some way changed his position.
[Supreme Court of Canada judgment in Maracle v. Travellers Indemnity Company of Canada (1991) 2 S.C.R.
50, page 57]
The Quebec Civil Code does not recognize the doctrine of promissory estoppel but Quebec courts have developed a similar concept known as "la fin de non-recevoir".
In most cases involving an asset retirement obligation, the determination of whether a legal obligation exists is unambiguous.
However, when no obligation has been assumed previously but an entity makes a promise to a third party about its intention to perform retirement activities, facts and circumstances need to be considered carefully in determining whether that promise has imposed a legal obligation upon the promisor under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
A legal obligation may exist even though no party has taken any formal action.
In assessing whether a legal obligation exists, an entity is not permitted to forecast changes in the law or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations.
However, entities must recognize that laws differ from one jurisdiction to another and evolve from time to time within individual jurisdictions.
Preparers and their legal advisors are required to evaluate current circumstances to determine whether a legal obligation exists.
The following examples explain circumstances in which the doctrine of promissory estoppel may apply.
The lease requires the company to restore the land but the obligation is enforceable only if the company ceases to operate the facility before the end of the 25th year of the lease.
In the 23rd year of the lease, the company's chief executive officer announces publicly that it plans to retire the facility in five years.
In that case, under the terms of the lease, the company would not be required to restore the land.
If the announcement also states that the company intends nevertheless to demolish the facility and restore the land, and it is reasonable to expect that the lessor would be aware of the announcement, the Canadian courts might conclude that there has been a promissory estoppel.
A promissory estoppel may exist even though no one had relied on the announcement to their detriment.
The promissory estoppel would prevent the company later from standing on the letter of the lease by which its obligation would have expired at the end of the 25th year of the lease.
For example, assume a company operates a manufacturing facility in the United States and has plans to retire it within five years.
Members of the local press have begun to publicize the fact that when the company ceases operations at the plant, it plans to abandon the site without demolishing the building and restoring the underlying land.
Due to the significant negative publicity and demands by the public that the company commit to dismantling the plant upon retirement, the company's chief executive officer holds a press conference at city hall to announce that the company will demolish the building and restore the underlying land when the company ceases operations at the plant.
Although no law, statute, ordinance, or written contract exists requiring the company to perform any demolition or restoration activities and there is no pre-existing legal relationship between the company and the public at large, the promise made by the company's chief executive officer may have created a legal obligation under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
In each of these circumstances, the company's management (and legal counsel, if necessary) would have to evaluate the particular facts and circumstances to determine whether a legal obligation exists.
Contracts between entities may contain an option or a provision that requires one party to the contract to perform retirement activities when an asset is retired.
The other party may decide in the future not to exercise the option or to waive the provision to perform retirement activities, or that party may have a history of waiving similar provisions in other contracts.
Even when there is an expectation of a waiver or non-enforcement, the contract still imposes a legal obligation.
That obligation is included in the scope of this Section.
The likelihood of a waiver or non-enforcement will affect the measurement of the liability.
In some circumstances, an entity may have doubts as to the existence of an asset retirement obligation because of uncertainty as to the meaning or application of a law, regulation or contract.
These circumstances do not involve conditional obligations of the type discussed in paragraphs 3110.A19-.A20 and 3110.A27-.A28.
They may arise when, for example, an entity is uncertain whether it has assumed an obligation through the operation of the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
The existence of any liability in such cases is contingent on a future determination by a court, a regulator or some other competent authority, or a future determination by the entity that it would be held liable.
Any such future determination by the entity would be based on future events or new information coming to light that would remove the current uncertainty, such as the receipt of an opinion from legal counsel.
In these circumstances, the guidance in CONTINGENCIES, Section 3290, applies in determining whether to recognize an asset retirement obligation.
In this Section, the term "retirement" is defined as the other-than-temporary removal of a long-lived asset from service.
As used in this Section, that term encompasses sale, abandonment, or disposal in some other manner.
However, it does not encompass the temporary idling of a long-lived asset.
After an entity retires an asset, that asset is no longer under the control of that entity, no longer in existence, or no longer capable of being used in the manner for which the asset was originally acquired, constructed, or developed.
Activities necessary to prepare an asset for an alternative use are not associated with the retirement of the asset and are not within the scope of this Section.
Typically, settlement of an asset retirement obligation is not required until the associated asset is retired.
However, certain circumstances may exist in which partial settlement of an asset retirement obligation is required or performed before the asset is fully retired.
The fact that partial settlement of an obligation is required or performed prior to full retirement of an asset does not remove that obligation from the scope of this Section.
Consider an entity that owns and operates a landfill, for example.
Regulations require that the entity perform capping, closure and post-closure activities.
Capping activities involve covering the land with topsoil and planting vegetation.
Closure activities include drainage, engineering and demolition and must be performed prior to commencing the post-closure activities.
Post-closure activities, the final retirement activities, include maintaining the landfill once final certification of closure has been received and monitoring the ground and surface water, gas emissions and air quality.
Closure and post-closure activities are performed after the entire landfill ceases receiving waste (i.e., after the landfill is retired).
However, capping activities are performed as sections of the landfill become full and are effectively retired.
The fact that some of the capping activities are performed while the landfill continues to accept waste does not remove the obligation to perform those intermediate capping activities from the scope of this Section.
Obligations associated with maintenance, rather than retirement, of a long-lived asset are excluded from the scope of this Section.
The cost of a replacement part that is a component of a long-lived asset is not within the scope of this Section.
Any legal obligations that require disposal of the replaced part are within the scope of this Section.
Paragraph 3110.02 limits the scope of this Section to those legal obligations that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of a long-lived asset.
In most circumstances, whether an obligation results from the acquisition, construction, or development of a long-lived asset is clear.
For example, if an entity acquires a landfill that is already in operation, an obligation to perform capping, closure and post-closure activities results from the acquisition and assumption of obligations related to past normal operations of the landfill.
Additional obligations will likely be incurred as a result of future operations of the landfill.
Whether an obligation results from the normal operation of a long-lived asset may require judgment.
Obligations that result from the normal operation of an asset are predictable and likely to occur.
For example, consider a company that owns and operates a nuclear power plant.
That company has a legal obligation to perform decontamination activities when the plant ceases operations.
Contamination, which gives rise to the obligation, is predictable and likely to occur and is unavoidable as a result of operating the plant.
Therefore, the obligation to perform decontamination activities at that plant results from the normal operation of the plant.
An environmental remediation liability that results from the improper operation of a long-lived asset does not fall within the scope of this Section.
Obligations resulting from improper operations do not represent costs that are an integral part of the tangible long-lived asset and, therefore, are not accounted for as part of the cost basis of the asset.
For example, a certain amount of spillage may be inherent in the normal operations of a fuel storage facility, but a catastrophic accident caused by non-compliance with a company's safety procedures is not.
The obligation to clean up after the catastrophic accident does not result from the normal operation of the facility and is not within the scope of this Section.
An environmental remediation liability that results from the normal operation of a long-lived asset, and is associated with the retirement of that asset, is accounted for under the provisions of this Section.
An asset retirement obligation may result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of a long-lived asset that has an indeterminate useful life and thereby an indeterminate settlement date for the asset retirement obligation.
Uncertainty about the timing of settlement of the asset retirement obligation does not remove that obligation from the scope of this Section but will affect the measurement of a liability for that obligation and possibly the timing of recognition of the liability (see paragraph 3110.A18).
An asset retirement obligation may exist for component parts of a larger system.
In some circumstances, the retirement of the component parts may be required before the retirement of the larger system to which the component parts belong.
For example, consider an aluminum smelter that owns and operates several kilns lined with a special type of brick.
The kilns have a long useful life, but the bricks wear out after approximately five years of use and are replaced on a periodic basis to maintain optimal efficiency of the kilns.
Because the bricks become contaminated with hazardous chemicals while in the kiln, a law requires that when the bricks are removed, they must be disposed of at a special hazardous waste site.
The obligation to dispose of those bricks is within the scope of this Section.
The cost of the replacement bricks and their installation are not part of that obligation.
An asset retirement obligation may arise in connection with a tangible long-lived asset that is not recognized on an entity's balance sheet.
For example, a lessee that has acquired a plant under an operating lease may, by statute or regulation or by the terms of its contract with the lessor, incur an obligation to dispose of hazardous waste and remediate any environmental damage upon the termination of the lease.
That obligation is within the scope of this Section.
Accordingly, the obligation and related asset retirement cost are recognized even though the asset itself is not recognized.
LIABILITY RECOGNITION
Instances may occur in which sufficient information to estimate the amount of an asset retirement obligation is not available.
For example, when an asset has an indeterminate useful life, sufficient information to estimate a range of potential settlement dates for the obligation might not be available.
In such cases, the liability is initially recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to estimate a range of potential settlement dates that is needed to employ a present value technique to estimate the amount of the obligation.
A conditional obligation to perform a retirement activity is within the scope of this Section.
For example, if a government unit retains the right (an option) to decide whether to require a retirement activity, there is some uncertainty about whether that retirement activity will be required or waived.
Regardless of the uncertainty attributable to the option, a legal obligation to stand ready to perform a retirement activity still exists, and the governmental unit might require it to be performed.
Uncertainty about whether performance will be required does not defer the recognition of a retirement obligation; rather, that uncertainty is factored into the measurement of the amount of the asset retirement obligation through assignment of probabilities to cash flows.
Uncertainty about performance of conditional obligations does not prevent the determination of a reasonable estimate of the amount of the obligation.
A past history of non-enforcement of an unambiguous obligation does not defer recognition of a liability, but its measurement is affected by the uncertainty over the requirement to perform retirement activities.
Uncertainty about the requirement to perform retirement activities does not prevent the determination of a reasonable estimate of the amount of the asset retirement obligation.
A newly enacted statute or new regulation may impose a new asset retirement obligation on an entity as a result of its past activities.
In such circumstances, the liability and related asset retirement cost are recognized when the obligation is first imposed, and the financial statements of prior periods presented for comparative purposes are not restated.
An entity may be entitled to recover asset retirement costs from another party.
In such circumstances, the asset retirement obligation is accounted for without regard to the recovery.
MEASUREMENT OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION
A present value technique is often the best available technique for estimating the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
It can be determined using the following elements:
an estimate of the future cash outflows expected with regard to the obligation;
expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those cash outflows; and
the time value of money, represented by the current market risk-free rate of interest, for maturity dates that coincide with the expected cash flows.
In determining the best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the present asset retirement obligation at the balance sheet date, an entity begins by estimating the future cash outflows that reflect an assessment of the cost and timing of performing the required retirement activities.
Considerations in estimating those cash outflows include developing and incorporating explicit assumptions, to the extent possible, about:
the costs that will be incurred in performing the tasks necessary to retire the asset; and
other amounts, such as inflation, overhead, equipment charges, and the effects of advances in technology.
There are two approaches to computing present value.
Under the traditional approach, adjustments for uncertainties as to the amount and timing of cash outflows are embedded in the discount rate.
Under the expected cash flow approach, uncertainties as to the amount and timing of cash outflows are reflected in risk-adjusted cash flows.
Uncertainties about the amount and timing of future cash flows can usually be accommodated in the present value calculation and, therefore, will not prevent the determination of a reasonable estimate of the amount of the asset retirement obligation.
When assets with asset retirement obligations are components of a larger group of assets (for example, a number of oil wells that make up an entire oil field operation), aggregation techniques may be necessary to derive a collective asset retirement obligation.
This Section does not preclude the use of estimates and computational shortcuts that are consistent with the measurement objective when computing an aggregate asset retirement obligation for assets that are components of a larger group of assets.
This Section requires recognition of the best estimate of a conditional asset retirement obligation before the event that either requires or waives performance occurs.
Uncertainty surrounding conditional performance of the retirement obligation is factored into its measurement by assessing the likelihood that performance will be required.
When the conditional aspect has only two outcomes and there is no information about which outcome is more probable, a 50 percent likelihood for each outcome is used until additional information is available.
As the time for notification approaches, more information and a better perspective about the ultimate outcome will likely be obtained.
Consequently, reassessment of the timing, amount and probabilities associated with the expected cash flows may change the amount of the liability recognized.
When, as time progresses, it becomes apparent that retirement activities will not be required, the liability and the remaining unamortized asset retirement cost are reduced to zero.
In summary, an unambiguous requirement that gives rise to an asset retirement obligation coupled with a low likelihood of required performance still requires recognition of a liability.
Uncertainty about the conditional outcome of the obligation is incorporated into the measurement of the amount of that liability, not the recognition decision.
SUBSEQUENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
In periods subsequent to initial measurement, an entity recognizes the effect of the passage of time on the amount of a liability for an asset retirement obligation.
A period-to-period increase in the carrying amount of the liability is recognized as an operating item (accretion expense) in the income statement.
An equivalent amount is added to the carrying amount of the liability.
To calculate accretion expense, an entity multiplies the beginning of the period liability balance by the discount rate used to measure the liability at the beginning of the period.
The liability is adjusted for accretion prior to adjusting for revisions in estimated cash flows.
Revisions to a previously recognized asset retirement obligation will result from changes in the assumptions used to estimate the cash flows required to settle the obligation, including changes in estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlement, as well as changes in the legal requirements of the obligation and changes in the discount rate.
Revisions to the asset retirement obligation result in adjustments of capitalized asset retirement costs and will affect subsequent depreciation of the related asset.
PRESENTATION OF CASH FLOWS — SETTLEMENT OF A LIABILITY
Cash payments made to settle an asset retirement obligation are classified in the statement of cash flows as an operating cash flow.

DISCLOSURES

Money loses purchasing power at such a rate that comparison of amounts from transactions and other events that have occurred at different times, even within the same accounting period, is misleading.
It is a matter of judgement when restatement of financial statements in accordance with this Standard becomes necessary.
Hyperinflation is indicated by characteristics of the economic environment of a country which include, but are not limited to, the following:
the general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency.
Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power;
the general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency.
Prices may be quoted in that currency;
sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;
interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index; and
the cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100%.
Nevertheless, this Standard applies to the financial statements of any entity from the beginning of the reporting period in which it identifies the existence of hyperinflation in the country in whose currency it reports.
The restatement of financial statements
Specific forces such as changes in supply and demand and technological changes may cause individual prices to increase or decrease significantly and independently of each other.
In addition, general forces may result in changes in the general level of prices and therefore in the general purchasing power of money.
The exceptions to this are those assets and liabilities that the entity is required, or chooses, to measure at fair value.
For example, property, plant and equipment may be revalued to fair value and biological assets are generally required to be measured at fair value.
Some entities, however, present financial statements that are based on a current cost approach that reflects the effects of changes in the specific prices of assets held.
As a result, this Standard applies to the financial statements of entities reporting in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy.
Presentation of the information required by this Standard as a supplement to unrestated financial statements is not permitted.
Furthermore, separate presentation of the financial statements before restatement is discouraged.
The corresponding figures for the previous period required by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (as revised in 2007) and any information in respect of earlier periods shall also be stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period.
For the purpose of presenting comparative amounts in a different presentation currency, paragraphs 42(b) and 43 of IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates apply.
The consistent application of these procedures and judgements from period to period is more important than the precise accuracy of the resulting amounts included in the restated financial statements.
Monetary items are money held and items to be received or paid in money.
These items are carried at this adjusted amount in the restated statement of financial position.
Some non-monetary items are carried at amounts current at the end of the reporting period, such as net realisable value and fair value, so they are not restated.
All other non-monetary assets and liabilities are restated.
The restated cost, or cost less depreciation, of each item is determined by applying to its historical cost and accumulated depreciation the change in a general price index from the date of acquisition to the end of the reporting period.
For example, property, plant and equipment, inventories of raw materials and merchandise, goodwill, patents, trademarks and similar assets are restated from the dates of their purchase.
Inventories of partly-finished and finished goods are restated from the dates on which the costs of purchase and of conversion were incurred.
In these rare circumstances, it may be necessary, in the first period of application of this Standard, to use an independent professional assessment of the value of the items as the basis for their restatement.
In these circumstances, it may be necessary to use an estimate based, for example, on the movements in the exchange rate between the functional currency and a relatively stable foreign currency.
In these cases, the carrying amounts are restated from the date of the revaluation.
For example, restated amounts of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, patents and trademarks are reduced to recoverable amount and restated amounts of inventories are reduced to net realisable value.
The statement of financial position and statement of comprehensive income of such an investee are restated in accordance with this Standard in order to calculate the investor's share of its net assets and profit or loss.
It is not appropriate both to restate the capital expenditure financed by borrowing and to capitalise that part of the borrowing costs that compensates for the inflation during the same period.
This part of the borrowing costs is recognised as an expense in the period in which the costs are incurred.
Where it is impracticable to impute the amount of interest, such assets are restated from the payment date and not the date of purchase.
Any revaluation surplus that arose in previous periods is eliminated.
The movements for the period in owners' equity are disclosed in accordance with IAS 1.
Therefore all amounts need to be restated by applying the change in the general price index from the dates when the items of income and expenses were initially recorded in the financial statements.
This gain or loss on the net monetary position may be derived as the difference resulting from the restatement of non-monetary assets, owners' equity and items in the statement of comprehensive income and the adjustment of index linked assets and liabilities.
The gain or loss may be estimated by applying the change in a general price index to the weighted average for the period of the difference between monetary assets and monetary liabilities.
The adjustment to those assets and liabilities linked by agreement to changes in prices made in accordance with paragraph 13 is offset against the gain or loss on net monetary position.
Other income and expense items, such as interest income and expense, and foreign exchange differences related to invested or borrowed funds, are also associated with the net monetary position.
Although such items are separately disclosed, it may be helpful if they are presented together with the gain or loss on net monetary position in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other items in the statement of financial position are restated in accordance with paragraphs 11 to 25.
Cost of sales and depreciation are recorded at current costs at the time of consumption; sales and other expenses are recorded at their money amounts when they occurred.
Therefore all amounts need to be restated into the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period by applying a general price index.
These differences are accounted for in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.
Information that is disclosed in respect of earlier periods is also expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period.
For the purpose of presenting comparative amounts in a different presentation currency, paragraphs 42(b) and 43 of IAS 21 apply.
The financial statements of any such subsidiary need to be restated by applying a general price index of the country in whose currency it reports before they are included in the consolidated financial statements issued by its parent.
Where such a subsidiary is a foreign subsidiary, its restated financial statements are translated at closing rates.
The financial statements of subsidiaries that do not report in the currencies of hyperinflationary economies are dealt with in accordance with IAS 21.
It is preferable that all entities that report in the currency of the same economy use the same index.

The principal issues in accounting for property, plant and equipment are the recognition of the assets, the determination of their carrying amounts and the depreciation charges and impairment losses to be recognised in relation to them.
property, plant and equipment classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
biological assets related to agricultural activity other than bearer plants (see IAS 41 Agriculture).
This Standard applies to bearer plants but it does not apply to the produce on bearer plants.
the recognition and measurement of exploration and evaluation assets (see IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources).
mineral rights and mineral reserves such as oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources.
However, this Standard applies to property, plant and equipment used to develop or maintain the assets described in (b)–(d).
A bearer plant is a living plant that:
is used in the production or supply of agricultural produce;
is expected to bear produce for more than one period; and
has a remote likelihood of being sold as agricultural produce, except for incidental scrap sales.
(Paragraphs 5A–5B of IAS 41 elaborate on this definition of a bearer plant.)
Carrying amount is the amount at which an asset is recognised after deducting any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the other consideration given to acquire an asset at the time of its acquisition or construction or, where applicable, the amount attributed to that asset when initially recognised in accordance with the specific requirements of other IFRSs, eg IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
Depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value.
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.
Entity-specific value is the present value of the cash flows an entity expects to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life or expects to incur when settling a liability.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
(See IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.)
An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Property, plant and equipment are tangible items that:
are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and
are expected to be used during more than one period.
Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
The residual value of an asset is the estimated amount that an entity would currently obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.
Useful life is:
the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use by an entity; or
the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by an entity.
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity; and
the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Otherwise, such items are classified as inventory.
Thus, judgement is required in applying the recognition criteria to an entity's specific circumstances.
It may be appropriate to aggregate individually insignificant items, such as moulds, tools and dies, and to apply the criteria to the aggregate value.
These costs include costs incurred initially to acquire or construct an item of property, plant and equipment and costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment may include costs incurred relating to leases of assets that are used to construct, add to, replace part of or service an item of property, plant and equipment, such as depreciation of right-of-use assets.
The acquisition of such property, plant and equipment, although not directly increasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may be necessary for an entity to obtain the future economic benefits from its other assets.
Such items of property, plant and equipment qualify for recognition as assets because they enable an entity to derive future economic benefits from related assets in excess of what could be derived had those items not been acquired.
For example, a chemical manufacturer may install new chemical handling processes to comply with environmental requirements for the production and storage of dangerous chemicals; related plant enhancements are recognised as an asset because without them the entity is unable to manufacture and sell chemicals.
However, the resulting carrying amount of such an asset and related assets is reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Rather, these costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Costs of day-to-day servicing are primarily the costs of labour and consumables, and may include the cost of small parts.
The purpose of these expenditures is often described as for the 'repairs and maintenance' of the item of property, plant and equipment.
For example, a furnace may require relining after a specified number of hours of use, or aircraft interiors such as seats and galleys may require replacement several times during the life of the airframe.
Items of property, plant and equipment may also be acquired to make a less frequently recurring replacement, such as replacing the interior walls of a building, or to make a nonrecurring replacement.
Under the recognition principle in paragraph 7, an entity recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met.
The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with the derecognition provisions of this Standard (see paragraphs 67–72).
When each major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.
Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is derecognised.
This occurs regardless of whether the cost of the previous inspection was identified in the transaction in which the item was acquired or constructed.
If necessary, the estimated cost of a future similar inspection may be used as an indication of what the cost of the existing inspection component was when the item was acquired or constructed.
Measurement at recognition
its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates.
any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.
costs of employee benefits (as defined in IAS 19 Employee Benefits) arising directly from the construction or acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment;
costs of site preparation;
initial delivery and handling costs;
installation and assembly costs;
costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, after deducting the net proceeds from selling any items produced while bringing the asset to that location and condition (such as samples produced when testing equipment); and
professional fees.
The obligations for costs accounted for in accordance with IAS 2 or IAS 16 are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
costs of opening a new facility;
costs of introducing a new product or service (including costs of advertising and promotional activities);
costs of conducting business in a new location or with a new class of customer (including costs of staff training); and
administration and other general overhead costs.
Therefore, costs incurred in using or redeploying an item are not included in the carrying amount of that item.
For example, the following costs are not included in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment:
costs incurred while an item capable of operating in the manner intended by management has yet to be brought into use or is operated at less than full capacity;
initial operating losses, such as those incurred while demand for the item's output builds up; and
costs of relocating or reorganising part or all of an entity's operations.
These incidental operations may occur before or during the construction or development activities.
For example, income may be earned through using a building site as a car park until construction starts.
Because incidental operations are not necessary to bring an item to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the income and related expenses of incidental operations are recognised in profit or loss and included in their respective classifications of income and expense.
If an entity makes similar assets for sale in the normal course of business, the cost of the asset is usually the same as the cost of constructing an asset for sale (see IAS 2).
Therefore, any internal profits are eliminated in arriving at such costs.
Similarly, the cost of abnormal amounts of wasted material, labour, or other resources incurred in self-constructing an asset is not included in the cost of the asset.
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs establishes criteria for the recognition of interest as a component of the carrying amount of a self-constructed item of property, plant and equipment.
Bearer plants are accounted for in the same way as self-constructed items of property, plant and equipment before they are in the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Consequently, references to 'construction' in this Standard should be read as covering activities that are necessary to cultivate the bearer plants before they are in the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
If payment is deferred beyond normal credit terms, the difference between the cash price equivalent and the total payment is recognised as interest over the period of credit unless such interest is capitalised in accordance with IAS 23.
The following discussion refers simply to an exchange of one non-monetary asset for another, but it also applies to all exchanges described in the preceding sentence.
The cost of such an item of property, plant and equipment is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable.
The acquired item is measured in this way even if an entity cannot immediately derecognise the asset given up.
If the acquired item is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up.
An exchange transaction has commercial substance if:
the configuration (risk, timing and amount) of the cash flows of the asset received differs from the configuration of the cash flows of the asset transferred; or
the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity's operations affected by the transaction changes as a result of the exchange; and
the difference in (a) or (b) is significant relative to the fair value of the assets exchanged.
For the purpose of determining whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance, the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity's operations affected by the transaction shall reflect post-tax cash flows.
The result of these analyses may be clear without an entity having to perform detailed calculations.
If an entity is able to measure reliably the fair value of either the asset received or the asset given up, then the fair value of the asset given up is used to measure the cost of the asset received unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident.
Measurement after recognition
Revaluations shall be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period.
32–33
When the fair value of a revalued asset differs materially from its carrying amount, a further revaluation is required.
Some items of property, plant and equipment experience significant and volatile changes in fair value, thus necessitating annual revaluation.
Such frequent revaluations are unnecessary for items of property, plant and equipment with only insignificant changes in fair value.
Instead, it may be necessary to revalue the item only every three or five years.
At the date of the revaluation, the asset is treated in one of the following ways:
the gross carrying amount is adjusted in a manner that is consistent with the revaluation of the carrying amount of the asset.
For example, the gross carrying amount may be restated by reference to observable market data or it may be restated proportionately to the change in the carrying amount.
The accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is adjusted to equal the difference between the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount of the asset after taking into account accumulated impairment losses; or
the accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset.
The amount of the adjustment of accumulated depreciation forms part of the increase or decrease in carrying amount that is accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 39 and 40.
The following are examples of separate classes:
land;
land and buildings;
machinery;
ships;
aircraft;
motor vehicles;
furniture and fixtures;
office equipment; and
bearer plants.
However, a class of assets may be revalued on a rolling basis provided revaluation of the class of assets is completed within a short period and provided the revaluations are kept up to date.
However, the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
However, the decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset.
The decrease recognised in other comprehensive income reduces the amount accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus.
This may involve transferring the whole of the surplus when the asset is retired or disposed of.
However, some of the surplus may be transferred as the asset is used by an entity.
In such a case, the amount of the surplus transferred would be the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation based on the asset's original cost.
Transfers from revaluation surplus to retained earnings are not made through profit or loss.
For example, it may be appropriate to depreciate separately the airframe and engines of an aircraft.
Such parts may be grouped in determining the depreciation charge.
The remainder consists of the parts of the item that are individually not significant.
If an entity has varying expectations for these parts, approximation techniques may be necessary to depreciate the remainder in a manner that faithfully represents the consumption pattern and/or useful life of its parts.
However, sometimes, the future economic benefits embodied in an asset are absorbed in producing other assets.
In this case, the depreciation charge constitutes part of the cost of the other asset and is included in its carrying amount.
For example, the depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment is included in the costs of conversion of inventories (see IAS 2).
Similarly, depreciation of property, plant and equipment used for development activities may be included in the cost of an intangible asset recognised in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Repair and maintenance of an asset do not negate the need to depreciate it.
In practice, the residual value of an asset is often insignificant and therefore immaterial in the calculation of the depreciable amount.
If it does, the asset's depreciation charge is zero unless and until its residual value subsequently decreases to an amount below the asset's carrying amount.
Depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with IFRS 5 and the date that the asset is derecognised.
Therefore, depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated.
However, under usage methods of depreciation the depreciation charge can be zero while there is no production.
However, other factors, such as technical or commercial obsolescence and wear and tear while an asset remains idle, often result in the diminution of the economic benefits that might have been obtained from the asset.
Consequently, all the following factors are considered in determining the useful life of an asset:
expected usage of the asset.
Usage is assessed by reference to the asset's expected capacity or physical output.
expected physical wear and tear, which depends on operational factors such as the number of shifts for which the asset is to be used and the repair and maintenance programme, and the care and maintenance of the asset while idle.
technical or commercial obsolescence arising from changes or improvements in production, or from a change in the market demand for the product or service output of the asset.
Expected future reductions in the selling price of an item that was produced using an asset could indicate the expectation of technical or commercial obsolescence of the asset, which, in turn, might reflect a reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
legal or similar limits on the use of the asset, such as the expiry dates of related leases.
The asset management policy of the entity may involve the disposal of assets after a specified time or after consumption of a specified proportion of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
Therefore, the useful life of an asset may be shorter than its economic life.
The estimation of the useful life of the asset is a matter of judgement based on the experience of the entity with similar assets.
With some exceptions, such as quarries and sites used for landfill, land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated.
Buildings have a limited useful life and therefore are depreciable assets.
An increase in the value of the land on which a building stands does not affect the determination of the depreciable amount of the building.
In some cases, the land itself may have a limited useful life, in which case it is depreciated in a manner that reflects the benefits to be derived from it.
Such a change shall be accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8.
These methods include the straight-line method, the diminishing balance method and the units of production method.
Straight-line depreciation results in a constant charge over the useful life if the asset's residual value does not change.
The diminishing balance method results in a decreasing charge over the useful life.
The units of production method results in a charge based on the expected use or output.
The entity selects the method that most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
That method is applied consistently from period to period unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits.
A depreciation method that is based on revenue that is generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset is not appropriate.
The revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits of the asset.
For example, revenue is affected by other inputs and processes, selling activities and changes in sales volumes and prices.
The price component of revenue may be affected by inflation, which has no bearing upon the way in which an asset is consumed.
That Standard explains how an entity reviews the carrying amount of its assets, how it determines the recoverable amount of an asset, and when it recognises, or reverses the recognition of, an impairment loss.
64
impairments of items of property, plant and equipment are recognised in accordance with IAS 36;
derecognition of items of property, plant and equipment retired or disposed of is determined in accordance with this Standard;
compensation from third parties for items of property, plant and equipment that were impaired, lost or given up is included in determining profit or loss when it becomes receivable; and
the cost of items of property, plant and equipment restored, purchased or constructed as replacements is determined in accordance with this Standard.
on disposal; or
when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Gains shall not be classified as revenue.
However, an entity that, in the course of its ordinary activities, routinely sells items of property, plant and equipment that it has held for rental to others shall transfer such assets to inventories at their carrying amount when they cease to be rented and become held for sale.
The proceeds from the sale of such assets shall be recognised as revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
IFRS 5 does not apply when assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business are transferred to inventories.
The date of disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 applies to disposal by a sale and leaseback.
If it is not practicable for an entity to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, it may use the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of the replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed.
Subsequent changes to the estimated amount of the consideration included in the gain or loss shall be accounted for in accordance with the requirements for changes in the transaction price in IFRS 15.
the measurement bases used for determining the gross carrying amount;
the depreciation methods used;
the useful lives or the depreciation rates used;
the gross carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation (aggregated with accumulated impairment losses) at the beginning and end of the period; and
a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period showing:
additions;
assets classified as held for sale or included in a disposal group classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 and other disposals;
(iii) acquisitions through business combinations;
(iv) increases or decreases resulting from revaluations under paragraphs 31, 39 and 40 and from impairment losses recognised or reversed in other comprehensive income in accordance with IAS 36;
impairment losses recognised in profit or loss in accordance with IAS 36;
(vi) impairment losses reversed in profit or loss in accordance with IAS 36;
(vii) depreciation;
(viii) the net exchange differences arising on the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency into a different presentation currency, including the translation of a foreign operation into the presentation currency of the reporting entity; and
(ix) other changes.
the existence and amounts of restrictions on title, and property, plant and equipment pledged as security for liabilities;
the amount of expenditures recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment in the course of its construction;
the amount of contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment; and
if it is not disclosed separately in the statement of comprehensive income, the amount of compensation from third parties for items of property, plant and equipment that were impaired, lost or given up that is included in profit or loss.
Therefore, disclosure of the methods adopted and the estimated useful lives or depreciation rates provides users of financial statements with information that allows them to review the policies selected by management and enables comparisons to be made with other entities.
For similar reasons, it is necessary to disclose:
depreciation, whether recognised in profit or loss or as a part of the cost of other assets, during a period; and
accumulated depreciation at the end of the period.
For property, plant and equipment, such disclosure may arise from changes in estimates with respect to:
residual values;
the estimated costs of dismantling, removing or restoring items of property, plant and equipment;
useful lives; and
depreciation methods.
the effective date of the revaluation;
whether an independent valuer was involved;
for each revalued class of property, plant and equipment, the carrying amount that would have been recognised had the assets been carried under the cost model; and
the revaluation surplus, indicating the change for the period and any restrictions on the distribution of the balance to shareholders.
the carrying amount of temporarily idle property, plant and equipment;
the gross carrying amount of any fully depreciated property, plant and equipment that is still in use;
the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment retired from active use and not classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5; and
when the cost model is used, the fair value of property, plant and equipment when this is materially different from the carrying amount.
Therefore, entities are encouraged to disclose these amounts.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors
IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates
Such foreign operations may be subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures or branches.
IAS 21 requires an entity to determine the functional currency of each of its foreign operations as the currency of the primary economic environment of that operation.
When translating the results and financial position of a foreign operation into a presentation currency, the entity is required to recognise foreign exchange differences in other comprehensive income until it disposes of the foreign operation.
IFRS 9 requires the designation of an eligible hedged item and eligible hedging instruments in a hedge accounting relationship.
If there is a designated hedging relationship, in the case of a net investment hedge, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge of the net investment is recognised in other comprehensive income and is included with the foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the results and financial position of the foreign operation.
This Interpretation provides guidance on identifying the foreign currency risks that qualify as a hedged risk in the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
IFRS 9 allows an entity to designate either a derivative or a non-derivative financial instrument (or a combination of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments) as hedging instruments for foreign currency risk.
This Interpretation provides guidance on how an entity should determine the amounts to be reclassified from equity to profit or loss for both the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
For convenience this Interpretation refers to such an entity as a parent entity and to the financial statements in which the net assets of foreign operations are included as consolidated financial statements.
All references to a parent entity apply equally to an entity that has a net investment in a foreign operation that is a joint venture, an associate or a branch.
Issues
The issues addressed in this Interpretation are:
the nature of the hedged risk and the amount of the hedged item for which a hedging relationship may be designated:
whether the parent entity may designate as a hedged risk only the foreign exchange differences arising from a difference between the functional currencies of the parent entity and its foreign operation, or whether it may also designate as the hedged risk the foreign exchange differences arising from the difference between the presentation currency of the parent entity's consolidated financial statements and the functional currency of the foreign operation;
if the parent entity holds the foreign operation indirectly, whether the hedged risk may include only the foreign exchange differences arising from differences in functional currencies between the foreign operation and its immediate parent entity, or whether the hedged risk may also include any foreign exchange differences between the functional currency of the foreign operation and any intermediate or ultimate parent entity (ie whether the fact that the net investment in the foreign operation is held through an intermediate parent affects the economic risk to the ultimate parent).
where in a group the hedging instrument can be held:
whether a qualifying hedge accounting relationship can be established only if the entity hedging its net investment is a party to the hedging instrument or whether any entity in the group, regardless of its functional currency, can hold the hedging instrument;
whether the nature of the hedging instrument (derivative or non-derivative) or the method of consolidation affects the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
what amounts should be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as reclassification adjustments on disposal of the foreign operation:
when a foreign operation that was hedged is disposed of, what amounts from the parent entity's foreign currency translation reserve in respect of the hedging instrument and in respect of that foreign operation should be reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the parent entity's consolidated financial statements;
whether the method of consolidation affects the determination of the amounts to be reclassified from equity to profit or loss.
Consensus
The carrying amount of the net assets of a foreign operation that may be designated as the hedged item in the consolidated financial statements of a parent depends on whether any lower level parent of the foreign operation has applied hedge accounting for all or part of the net assets of that foreign operation and that accounting has been maintained in the parent's consolidated financial statements.
Therefore, if the same net assets of a foreign operation are hedged by more than one parent entity within the group (for example, both a direct and an indirect parent entity) for the same risk, only one hedging relationship will qualify for hedge accounting in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent.
A hedging relationship designated by one parent entity in its consolidated financial statements need not be maintained by another higher level parent entity.
However, if it is not maintained by the higher level parent entity, the hedge accounting applied by the lower level parent must be reversed before the higher level parent's hedge accounting is recognised.
In particular, the hedging strategy of the group should be clearly documented because of the possibility of different designations at different levels of the group.
Depending on where the hedging instrument is held, in the absence of hedge accounting the total change in value might be recognised in profit or loss, in other comprehensive income, or both.
However, the assessment of effectiveness is not affected by whether the change in value of the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income.
As part of the application of hedge accounting, the total effective portion of the change is included in other comprehensive income.
The assessment of effectiveness is not affected by whether the hedging instrument is a derivative or a non-derivative instrument or by the method of consolidation.
That amount is the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that was determined to be an effective hedge.
In the ultimate parent's consolidated financial statements, the aggregate net amount recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in respect of all foreign operations is not affected by the consolidation method.
However, whether the ultimate parent uses the direct or the step-by-step method of consolidation {§2} 2 may affect the amount included in its foreign currency translation reserve in respect of an individual foreign operation.
The use of the step-by-step method of consolidation may result in the reclassification to profit or loss of an amount different from that used to determine hedge effectiveness.
This difference may be eliminated by determining the amount relating to that foreign operation that would have arisen if the direct method of consolidation had been used.
Making this adjustment is not required by IAS 21.
However, it is an accounting policy choice that should be followed consistently for all net investments.
An entity shall apply the amendment to paragraph 14 made by Improvements to IFRSs issued in April 2009 for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
Earlier application of both is permitted.
If an entity applies this Interpretation for a period beginning before 1 October 2008, or the amendment to paragraph 14 before 1 July 2009, it shall disclose that fact.
18B
IFRS 9, as issued in July 2014, amended paragraphs 3, 5–7, 14, 16, AG1 and AG8 and deleted paragraph 18A.
Transition
IAS 8 specifies how an entity applies a change in accounting policy resulting from the initial application of an Interpretation.
An entity is not required to comply with those requirements when first applying the Interpretation.
If an entity had designated a hedging instrument as a hedge of a net investment but the hedge does not meet the conditions for hedge accounting in this Interpretation, the entity shall apply IAS 39 to discontinue that hedge accounting prospectively.
This appendix is an integral part of the Interpretation.
AG1
This appendix illustrates the application of the Interpretation using the corporate structure illustrated below.
In all cases the hedging relationships described would be tested for effectiveness in accordance with IFRS 9, although this testing is not discussed in this appendix.
Parent, being the ultimate parent entity, presents its consolidated financial statements in its functional currency of euro (EUR).
Each of the subsidiaries is wholly owned.
Parent's £500 million net investment in Subsidiary B (functional currency pounds sterling (GBP)) includes the £159 million equivalent of Subsidiary B's US$300 million net investment in Subsidiary C (functional currency US dollars (USD)).
In other words, Subsidiary B's net assets other than its investment in Subsidiary C are £341 million.
Nature of hedged risk for which a hedging relationship may be designated (paragraphs 10–13)
AG2
Parent can hedge its net investment in each of Subsidiaries A, B and C for the foreign exchange risk between their respective functional currencies (Japanese yen (JPY), pounds sterling and US dollars) and euro.
In addition, Parent can hedge the USD / GBP foreign exchange risk between the functional currencies of Subsidiary B and Subsidiary C. In its consolidated financial statements, Subsidiary B can hedge its net investment in Subsidiary C for the foreign exchange risk between their functional currencies of US dollars and pounds sterling.
In the following examples the designated risk is the spot foreign exchange risk because the hedging instruments are not derivatives.
If the hedging instruments were forward contracts, Parent could designate the forward foreign exchange risk.
Amount of hedged item for which a hedging relationship may be designated (paragraphs 10–13)
AG3
Parent wishes to hedge the foreign exchange risk from its net investment in Subsidiary C. Assume that Subsidiary A has an external borrowing of US$300 million.
The net assets of Subsidiary A at the start of the reporting period are ¥400,000 million including the proceeds of the external borrowing of US$300 million.
AG4
The hedged item can be an amount of net assets equal to or less than the carrying amount of Parent's net investment in Subsidiary C (US$300 million) in its consolidated financial statements.
In its consolidated financial statements Parent can designate the US$300 million external borrowing in Subsidiary A as a hedge of the EUR / USD spot foreign exchange risk associated with its net investment in the US$300 million net assets of Subsidiary C. In this case, both the EUR / USD foreign exchange difference on the US$300 million external borrowing in Subsidiary A and the EUR / USD foreign exchange difference on the US$300 million net investment in Subsidiary C are included in the foreign currency translation reserve in Parent's consolidated financial statements after the application of hedge accounting.
AG5
In the absence of hedge accounting, the total USD / EUR foreign exchange difference on the US$300 million external borrowing in Subsidiary A would be recognised in Parent's consolidated financial statements as follows:
USD / JPY spot foreign exchange rate change, translated to euro, in profit or loss, and
JPY / EUR spot foreign exchange rate change in other comprehensive income.
Instead of the designation in paragraph AG4, in its consolidated financial statements Parent can designate the US$300 million external borrowing in Subsidiary A as a hedge of the GBP / USD spot foreign exchange risk between Subsidiary C and Subsidiary B. In this case, the total USD / EUR foreign exchange difference on the US$300 million external borrowing in Subsidiary A would instead be recognised in Parent's consolidated financial statements as follows:
the GBP / USD spot foreign exchange rate change in the foreign currency translation reserve relating to Subsidiary C,
GBP / JPY spot foreign exchange rate change, translated to euro, in profit or loss, and
AG6
Parent cannot designate the US$300 million external borrowing in Subsidiary A as a hedge of both the EUR / USD spot foreign exchange risk and the GBP / USD spot foreign exchange risk in its consolidated financial statements.
A single hedging instrument can hedge the same designated risk only once.
Subsidiary B cannot apply hedge accounting in its consolidated financial statements because the hedging instrument is held outside the group comprising Subsidiary B and Subsidiary C.
Where in a group can the hedging instrument be held (paragraphs 14 and 15)?
AG7
As noted in paragraph AG5, the total change in value in respect of foreign exchange risk of the US$300 million external borrowing in Subsidiary A would be recorded in both profit or loss (USD / JPY spot risk) and other comprehensive income (EUR / JPY spot risk) in Parent's consolidated financial statements in the absence of hedge accounting.
Both amounts are included for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of the hedge designated in paragraph AG4 because the change in value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are computed by reference to the euro functional currency of Parent against the US dollar functional currency of Subsidiary C, in accordance with the hedge documentation.
The method of consolidation (ie direct method or step-by-step method) does not affect the assessment of the effectiveness of the hedge.
Amounts reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of a foreign operation (paragraphs 16 and 17)
AG8
in respect of the US$300 million external borrowing of Subsidiary A, the amount that IFRS 9 requires to be identified, ie the total change in value in respect of foreign exchange risk that was recognised in other comprehensive income as the effective portion of the hedge; and
in respect of the US$300 million net investment in Subsidiary C, the amount determined by the entity's consolidation method.
If Parent uses the direct method, its FCTR in respect of Subsidiary C will be determined directly by the EUR / USD foreign exchange rate.
If Parent uses the step-by-step method, its FCTR in respect of Subsidiary C will be determined by the FCTR recognised by Subsidiary B reflecting the GBP / USD foreign exchange rate, translated to Parent's functional currency using the EUR / GBP foreign exchange rate.
Parent's use of the step-by-step method of consolidation in prior periods does not require it to or preclude it from determining the amount of FCTR to be reclassified when it disposes of Subsidiary C to be the amount that it would have recognised if it had always used the direct method, depending on its accounting policy.
Hedging more than one foreign operation (paragraphs 11, 13 and 15)
AG9
The following examples illustrate that in the consolidated financial statements of Parent, the risk that can be hedged is always the risk between its functional currency (euro) and the functional currencies of Subsidiaries B and C. No matter how the hedges are designated, the maximum amounts that can be effective hedges to be included in the foreign currency translation reserve in Parent's consolidated financial statements when both foreign operations are hedged are US$300 million for EUR / USD risk and £341 million for EUR / GBP risk.
Other changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates are included in Parent's consolidated profit or loss.
Of course, it would be possible for Parent to designate US$300 million only for changes in the USD / GBP spot foreign exchange rate or £500 million only for changes in the GBP / EUR spot foreign exchange rate.
Parent holds both USD and GBP hedging instruments
AG10
Parent may wish to hedge the foreign exchange risk in relation to its net investment in Subsidiary B as well as that in relation to Subsidiary C. Assume that Parent holds suitable hedging instruments denominated in US dollars and pounds sterling that it could designate as hedges of its net investments in Subsidiary B and Subsidiary C. The designations Parent can make in its consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the following:
AG11
The EUR / USD risk from Parent's net investment in Subsidiary C is a different risk from the EUR / GBP risk from Parent's net investment in Subsidiary B. However, in the case described in paragraph AG10(a), by its designation of the USD hedging instrument it holds, Parent has already fully hedged the EUR / USD risk from its net investment in Subsidiary C. If Parent also designated a GBP instrument it holds as a hedge of its £500 million net investment in Subsidiary B, £159 million of that net investment, representing the GBP equivalent of its USD net investment in Subsidiary C, would be hedged twice for GBP / EUR risk in Parent's consolidated financial statements.
AG12
In the case described in paragraph AG10(b), if Parent designates the hedged risk as the spot foreign exchange exposure (GBP / USD) between Subsidiary B and Subsidiary C, only the GBP / USD part of the change in the value of its US$300 million hedging instrument is included in Parent's foreign currency translation reserve relating to Subsidiary C. The remainder of the change (equivalent to the GBP / EUR change on £159 million) is included in Parent's consolidated profit or loss, as in paragraph AG5.
Because the designation of the USD / GBP risk between Subsidiaries B and C does not include the GBP / EUR risk, Parent is also able to designate up to £500 million of its net investment in Subsidiary B with the risk being the spot foreign exchange exposure (GBP / EUR) between Parent and Subsidiary B.
Subsidiary B holds the USD hedging instrument
AG13
Assume that Subsidiary B holds US$300 million of external debt the proceeds of which were transferred to Parent by an inter-company loan denominated in pounds sterling.
Because both its assets and liabilities increased by £159 million, Subsidiary B's net assets are unchanged.
Subsidiary B could designate the external debt as a hedge of the GBP / USD risk of its net investment in Subsidiary C in its consolidated financial statements. Parent could maintain Subsidiary B's designation of that hedging instrument as a hedge of its US$300 million net investment in Subsidiary C for the GBP / USD risk (see paragraph 13) and Parent could designate the GBP hedging instrument it holds as a hedge of its entire £500 million net investment in Subsidiary B. The first hedge, designated by Subsidiary B, would be assessed by reference to Subsidiary B's functional currency (pounds sterling) and the second hedge, designated by Parent, would be assessed by reference to Parent's functional currency (euro).
In this case, only the GBP / USD risk from Parent's net investment in Subsidiary C has been hedged in Parent's consolidated financial statements by the USD hedging instrument, not the entire EUR / USD risk.
Therefore, the entire EUR / GBP risk from Parent's £500 million net investment in Subsidiary B may be hedged in the consolidated financial statements of Parent.
AG14
However, the accounting for Parent's £159 million loan payable to Subsidiary B must also be considered. If Parent's loan payable is not considered part of its net investment in Subsidiary B because it does not satisfy the conditions in IAS 21 paragraph 15, the GBP / EUR foreign exchange difference arising on translating it would be included in Parent's consolidated profit or loss.
If the £159 million loan payable to Subsidiary B is considered part of Parent's net investment, that net investment would be only £341 million and the amount Parent could designate as the hedged item for GBP / EUR risk would be reduced from £500 million to £341 million accordingly.
AG15
If Parent reversed the hedging relationship designated by Subsidiary B, Parent could designate the US$300 million external borrowing held by Subsidiary B as a hedge of its US$300 million net investment in Subsidiary C for the EUR / USD risk and designate the GBP hedging instrument it holds itself as a hedge of only up to £341 million of the net investment in Subsidiary B. In this case the effectiveness of both hedges would be computed by reference to Parent's functional currency (euro).
Consequently, both the USD / GBP change in value of the external borrowing held by Subsidiary B and the GBP / EUR change in value of Parent's loan payable to Subsidiary B (equivalent to USD / EUR in total) would be included in the foreign currency translation reserve in Parent's consolidated financial statements.
Because Parent has already fully hedged the EUR / USD risk from its net investment in Subsidiary C, it can hedge only up to £341 million for the EUR / GBP risk of its net investment in Subsidiary B.
1 This will be the case for consolidated financial statements, financial statements in which investments such as associates or joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and financial statements that include a branch or a joint operation as defined in IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
2 The direct method is the method of consolidation in which the financial statements of the foreign operation are translated directly into the functional currency of the ultimate parent.

These standards apply to all pension plans, including defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.
They establish requirements for measurement and presentation of information in general purpose financial statements of pension plans, as well as financial statement disclosures.
Such financial statements provide information about the pension plan including net assets available for benefits and pension obligations.
A pension plan is a reporting entity separate from a sponsor and the plan participants.
These standards apply to pension plan financial statements prepared for participants as a group and for other interested parties.
They do not deal with reporting to individual participants about their individual pension benefits.
One of the uses of general purpose financial statements of pension plans is to assess the ability of the pension plan to meet future benefit payments.
Such financial statements cannot provide all the information that is needed to fully assess benefit security.
In addition to pension plan financial statements prepared in accordance with these standards, participants may also need to review, amongst other things, actuarial reports, and to take into account the financial health of the sponsor.
Such additional information is beyond the scope of these standards.
Some benefit plans have characteristics similar to pension plans and provide benefits other than pensions (for example, retiree health care and life insurance benefit plans, health and welfare plans providing benefits during active service, and long-term disability plans).
These standards also apply to general purpose financial statements of such plans.
However, certain adaptations may be necessary to take into account the specific nature of such plans.
The following terms are used in these standards with the meanings specified.
An accrued benefit obligation is the amount determined by the plan sponsor to be the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee services rendered to a particular date.
Accrued pension benefits are the benefits attributed to services rendered up to a particular date.
Actuarial asset value of a pension plan's investment portfolio is the value the pension plan uses for funding purposes.
In most cases, this value is different from fair value.
An example is an adjusted market value method that recognizes changes in the fair value of a pension plan's investment portfolio over a period of five years.
Actuarial present value is the discounted value of an amount or series of amounts payable or receivable at various times, determined as of a particular date by the application of a particular set of actuarial assumptions.
An actuarial valuation is an assessment of the financial status of a pension plan. It consists of the valuation of the pension plan's investment portfolio and the calculation of the actuarial present value of benefits to be paid under the terms of the plan.
A benefit plan is any arrangement whereby an entity undertakes to provide employees with benefits during and/or after active service in exchange for their services.
For the purposes of determining the pension obligation of a defined benefit pension plan, best estimate assumptions are a set of actuarial assumptions each of which reflects the judgment of the administrator (the person or group of persons responsible for the content and issuance of a pension plan's financial statements) about the most likely set of conditions affecting future events.
A defined benefit pension plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution pension plan.
A defined contribution pension plan is a pension plan that specifies how an entity's contributions to the plan are determined rather than the benefits to be received by an employee or the method of determining those benefits.
A derivative is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:
its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract (sometimes called the "underlying");
it requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors; and
(iii) it is settled at a future date.
(deleted)
A financial asset is any asset that is:
an equity instrument of another entity; or
(iii) a contractual right:
to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity; or
to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the pension plan.
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
A financial liability is any liability that is a contractual obligation:
to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity; or
to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the pension plan.
A funding valuation is an actuarial valuation that provides the plan sponsor with a funding schedule to enable accumulation of sufficient funds over employees' working careers for the plan to be in a position to pay pension benefits as they become due.
An investment portfolio consists of investment assets and investment liabilities defined as follows:
Examples include equity and debt instruments, loans, real estate, infrastructure, royalty agreements, private equity, hedges and other derivatives in an asset position, an interest in a master trust, and insurance contracts related to the plan's pension obligation of which the plan is the beneficiary.
Investment assets do not include other assets relating to the administration of the pension plan (for example, prepaid rent for offices or office equipment).
Examples include hedges and other derivatives in a liability position, real estate mortgages, repurchase agreements, financial instruments sold but not yet purchased, and cash collateral received from counterparties.
Investment liabilities do not include other liabilities relating to the administration of the pension plan (for example, employee salaries or rent for offices).
A master trust is a pool of assets into which contributions from pension plans of an employer or a group of employers are deposited for investment.
Each plan has an undivided interest in the assets held in the trust and ownership is represented by the proportionate dollar interest or by units of participation.
A multiemployer pension plan is a pension plan to which two or more unrelated employers contribute, usually pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements.
Net assets available for benefits is the difference between a plan's assets and its liabilities.
For the purposes of this definition, a plan's liabilities do not include accrued pension benefits.
A participant is any employee or former employee, or any member or former member of a trade or other association, or the beneficiaries of those individuals, for whom there are accrued pension benefits in the pension plan.
A pension obligation of a defined benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of accrued pension benefits determined by applying best estimate assumptions and the projected benefit method prorated on services.
This is a commonly used accrued benefit method. Under this method an equal portion of the total estimated benefit (i.e., with salary projection, when appropriate) is attributed to each year of service.
The actuarial present value of accrued pension benefits is derived after the benefits are attributed to the years of service up to the date of determination.
Related parties exist when one party has the ability to exercise, directly or indirectly, control, joint control or significant influence over the other.
Related parties also include management and immediate family members.
A related party transaction is a transfer of economic resources or obligations between related parties, or the provision of services by one party to a related party, regardless of whether any consideration is exchanged.
When the relationship arises as a result of the transaction, the transaction is not one between related parties.
(aa) Sponsor
In the case of a single employer pension plan, the sponsor is the employer. In the case of a multiemployer pension plan, the sponsor is the association, committee, board of trustees, or other group representatives of the employees and employers or other parties who have established the pension plan.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
A pension plan shall follow the requirements set out in these standards for the measurement, presentation and disclosure of its investment portfolio and pension obligations.
In selecting or changing accounting policies that do not relate to its investment portfolio or pension obligations, a pension plan shall comply on a consistent basis with either International Financial Reporting Standards in Part I of the Handbook, or accounting standards for private enterprises in Part II of the Handbook, to the extent that those standards do not conflict with the requirements of this Section.
A pension plan shall also apply the general financial statement presentation requirements of the basis of accounting chosen in accordance with paragraph 4600.07 with respect to:
fair presentation;
comparative information; and
materiality.
Pension plan financial statements shall be prepared using the accrual basis of accounting.
PENSION PLAN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Pension plan financial statements shall consist of:
a statement of financial position;
a statement of changes in net assets available for benefits; and
a statement of changes in pension obligations.
Information about the net assets available for benefits, combined with information about the pension obligations, assists users of the financial statements to assess the plan's present and future ability to pay benefits when due.
The statement of financial position shall distinguish at least the following:
investment assets;
investment liabilities;
participants' contributions receivable;
sponsor's contributions receivable;
other assets and liabilities;
net assets available for benefits (total of items (a)-(e));
pension obligations; and
the resulting surplus or deficit (item (f) less item (g)).
Details of investment assets and investment liabilities shall be presented either on the face of the statement or in the notes to the financial statements.
Investment assets and investment liabilities are distinguished by type because that information is useful to users in understanding the risks associated with a pension plan's investments.
Types of investment assets and investment liabilities include, but are not limited to, those identified in paragraph 4600.05(q).
Investment assets are presented on a non-consolidated basis even when the investment is in an entity over which the pension plan has control or can exercise significant influence.
A pension plan may also have other assets and liabilities such as assets relating to the administration of the pension plan (for example, prepaid rent for offices or office equipment) and liabilities relating to the administration of the pension plan (for example, employee salaries or rent for offices).
A pension plan may present an unclassified statement of financial position.
All financial assets and financial liabilities shall be recognized and derecognized in accordance with the recognition and derecognition requirements in either Part I of the Handbook, or Part II of the Handbook, consistent with the basis of accounting chosen in accordance with paragraph 4600.07.
All investment assets and investment liabilities shall be measured at fair value at the date of the statement of financial position.
In determining fair value, a pension plan shall refer to the guidance on fair value measurement in Part I of the Handbook.
Transaction costs are not included in the fair value of investment assets and investment liabilities either on initial recognition or on subsequent remeasurement.
Transaction costs are included in the statement of changes in net assets available for benefits as part of expenses incurred in the period.
Assets held primarily for use in plan operations (for example, land and buildings, equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization and any impairment loss.
A pension plan shall measure the pension obligation required by paragraph 4600.12(g) in accordance with paragraph 4600.05(v).
For this purpose, a pension plan may measure the pension obligation at the defined benefit obligation amount determined by the plan's sponsor.
Guidance on determining the defined benefit obligation can be found in EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS, Section 3462, in Part II of the Handbook, and in IAS 19 Employee Benefits in Part I of the Handbook.
For a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan, the funding valuation is generally the only actuarial valuation available, and it provides the relevant pension obligation information for the purposes of these standards.
The statement of changes in net assets available for benefits shall distinguish at least the following:
investment income, excluding changes in fair values of investment assets and investment liabilities;
changes during the period in the fair values of investment assets and investment liabilities;
contributions from the sponsor;
contributions from participants;
administrative expenses;
benefit payments;
refunds and transfers; and
net assets available for benefits at the beginning and the end of the period.
Details of investment income by type shall be presented either on the face of the statement or in the notes to the financial statements.
.25B
Investment income is distinguished by type on a basis consistent with that used for investment assets and investment liabilities (see paragraph 4600.14).
Changes in fair value include both realized and unrealized gains and losses.
The statement of changes in net assets available for benefits shall present the following, either on the face of the statement, or in the notes to the financial statements:
details of contributions showing separately voluntary and required contributions from participants, past service contributions from participants, past service contributions from the sponsor, current service contributions from the sponsor, and special contributions;
details of administrative expenses showing separately actuarial fees, audit fees, trustee and custodial fees, investment management fees, and any other significant administrative expenses;
details of benefit payments showing separately retirement benefit payments, disability benefit payments, termination benefit payments and death benefit payments.
Changes in pension obligations may affect the adequacy of plan assets to pay benefits when due and shall be provided to portray the consequences of transactions and events affecting the pension plan.
The statement of changes in pension obligations of a defined benefit plan shall present separately on the face of the statement the effects of the following:
amendments to the plan;
changes in the nature of the plan (e.g., a merger with another plan);
changes in actuarial assumptions;
interest accrued on benefits;
experience gains and losses;
benefits accrued; and
benefits paid.
A pension plan shall disclose the following information:
a summary description of the plan;
the significant accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements (i.e., those that are relevant to an understanding of the financial statements);
the funding policy and any changes in funding policy during the period;
the amounts and types of investments in the plan sponsor or in related parties of the plan sponsor; and
transactions between the pension plan and the plan sponsor, and any other related party transactions of the pension plan.
Additional investments by the plan in existing investees, dividends and interest paid to the plan by investees, and similar transactions are not required to be disclosed for purposes of this subparagraph.
A summary description of the plan provides information concerning matters such as the type of plan and a description of major terms and benefits (for example, pension formula, retirement age, death benefits, vesting provisions, survivor benefits, and withdrawal provisions).
A pension plan that prepares its financial statements in accordance with Canadian accounting standards for pension plans shall state this basis of presentation prominently in the notes to its financial statements.
A pension plan shall provide the following information about its investment portfolio:
for those investments that are financial instruments:
the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures in Part I of the Handbook; and
the fair value disclosures required by the Appendix to this Section; and
for all other investments, a description of how fair values have been determined.
In some defined contribution plans, members direct the investment decisions for the assets in their accounts.
A defined benefit pension plan may measure its investment portfolio on an actuarial asset value basis for funding and internal management purposes.
When a plan chooses to disclose the actuarial asset value, it discloses the amount of any difference between the actuarial asset value and the asset value determined in accordance with paragraph 4600.19, together with an explanation of that difference.
That difference, commonly referred to as an actuarial asset value adjustment, shall not be included in the amount presented in the statement of financial position as net assets available for benefits (see paragraph 4600.12(f)), or for the resulting surplus or deficit (see paragraph 4600.12(h)).
A defined benefit pension plan shall disclose the following information:
the effective date of the actuarial valuation used to determine the pension obligation;
the effective date of the next required actuarial valuation;
the name of the actuarial firm that performed the valuation; and
the significant assumptions used in determining the pension obligation including the rate of compensation increase and the discount rate.
For a defined contribution pension plan, pension benefits are determined by the sponsor's and employees' contributions and the performance of the plan.
Actuarial valuations are normally not required as the pension obligation equals the net assets available for benefits.
Where amounts allocated to participants are less than the net assets available for benefits, it is appropriate to disclose the basis of allocation and the amount of unallocated assets.
A pension plan shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the pension plan's objectives, policies and processes for managing capital in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs 135-136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements in Part I of the Handbook.
A pension plan shall apply these standards for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011, except as specified in paragraphs 4600.40-.41.
A pension plan shall apply these standards retrospectively to all prior periods presented.
In satisfying the fair value measurement requirements in paragraph 4600.19, a pension plan applies IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement in Part I of the Handbook to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
Earlier application of IFRS 13 is permitted provided that the pension plan discloses that fact and the measurement requirements are applied to the fair value of all investment assets and investment liabilities.
IFRS 13 is applied prospectively as of the beginning of the annual period in which it is initially applied.
A pension plan that has adopted IFRS 13 is not required to provide the disclosures included in that IFRS.
Prior to adopting IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement in Part I of the Handbook, a pension plan refers to the guidance on fair value measurement in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in Part I of the Handbook.
FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
The fair value disclosures formerly in paragraphs 27-27B of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures in Part I of the Handbook were deleted as a consequence of incorporating IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement into the Handbook. Paragraph 4600.32(a)(ii) requires the fair value disclosures in this Appendix, which are the same as those deleted from IFRS 7.
The required disclosures are:
For example, if applicable, an entity discloses information about the assumptions relating to prepayment rates, rates of estimated credit losses, and interest rates or discount rates.
If there has been a change in valuation technique, the entity shall disclose that change and the reasons for making it.
To make the disclosures required by paragraph 27B an entity shall classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The fair value hierarchy shall have the following levels:
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices) (Level 2); and
inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.
If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgement, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.
27B
For fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position an entity shall disclose for each class of financial instruments:
the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements are categorised in their entirety, segregating fair value measurements in accordance with the levels defined in paragraph 27A.
any significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers.
Transfers into each level shall be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of each level.
For this purpose, significance shall be judged with respect to profit or loss, and total assets or total liabilities.
for fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, a reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances, disclosing separately changes during the period attributable to the following:
total gains or losses for the period recognised in profit or loss, and a description of where they are presented in the statement of comprehensive income or the separate income statement (if presented);
total gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income;
(iii) purchases, sales, issues and settlements (each type of movement disclosed separately); and
(iv) transfers into or out of Level 3 (eg transfers attributable to changes in the observability of market data) and the reasons for those transfers.
For significant transfers, transfers into Level 3 shall be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of Level 3.
the amount of total gains or losses for the period in (c)(i) above included in profit or loss that are attributable to gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period and a description of where those gains or losses are presented in the statement of comprehensive income or the separate income statement (if presented).
for fair value measurements in Level 3, if changing one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would change fair value significantly, the entity shall state that fact and disclose the effect of those changes.
The entity shall disclose how the effect of a change to a reasonably possible alternative assumption was calculated.
For this purpose, significance shall be judged with respect to profit or loss, and total assets or total liabilities, or, when changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income, total equity.
An entity shall present the quantitative disclosures required by this paragraph in tabular format unless another format is more appropriate.

This Section establishes standards for investments in arrangements in which the investor has joint control.
However, this Section does not deal with accounting by joint arrangements themselves.
This Section applies when economic activities meet the definitions and criteria outlined in paragraphs 3056.03-.15, even though such activities may not be referred to as joint arrangements.
However, this Section does not apply when economic activities do not meet the definitions and criteria set out in paragraphs 3056.03-.15 even though they may sometimes be referred to as joint arrangements.
Accounting for investments in such activities is governed by the nature of the investments (see SUBSIDIARIES, Section 1591, INVESTMENTS, Section 3051, and FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, Section 3856).
A distinctive characteristic common to all joint arrangements is that two or more investors are bound by a contractual arrangement that establishes that the investors have joint control over the joint arrangement, regardless of the difference that may exist in their ownership interest.
None of the individual investors is in a position to exercise unilateral control over the joint arrangement.
Decisions in all areas essential to the accomplishment of the joint arrangement require the consent of the investors in such manner as defined in the terms of the contractual arrangement.
This characteristic of joint control distinguishes interests in joint arrangements from investments in other activities over which an investor may exercise control or significant influence (see SUBSIDIARIES, Section 1591, and INVESTMENTS, Section 3051).
Activities conducted with no formal contractual arrangements that are jointly controlled in substance are joint arrangements for the purposes of this Section.
Interests in an economic activity as described above may exist without entitling all the investors to share in joint control.
In such cases, this would not be considered an interest in a joint arrangement for those investors who do not share in joint control, even though the economic activity may be viewed as a joint arrangement by those investors who do have joint control.
The interest of an investor who does not have joint control over the joint arrangement qualifies as an investment and is subject to the requirements of INVESTMENTS, Section 3051, or FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, Section 3856.
An investor that has joint control over a joint arrangement has the right and ability to obtain future economic benefits from the resources of the joint arrangement and is exposed to related risks.
Future economic benefits normally include cash flows or other form of output generated by the joint arrangement, and related risks normally include exposure to losses of the joint arrangement or the direct exposure of the investor to loss.
An investor who has made a loan to a joint arrangement does not have similar exposure to the benefits and related risks of the joint arrangement.
For example, an arrangement whereby an investor is not entitled to share in the net income of the joint arrangement and has recourse to assets of the other investors would suggest that the risks and rewards of the investor are similar to those associated with a loan.
Accordingly, the investor would account for the arrangement as a loan.
The contractual arrangement that binds the investors may take different forms.
For example, it may be evidenced by a contract between the investors or, in some cases, the arrangement may be incorporated in the articles or other by-laws of the joint arrangement.
Whatever its form, the contractual arrangement is usually in writing and covers matters such as the purpose, activities, duration, policies and procedures of the joint arrangement, the allocation of ownership, the decision-making process, the capital contributions by the investors, and the sharing by the investors of the output, revenue, expenses or results of the joint arrangement.
The contractual arrangement may designate an investor as the manager or the operator of the joint arrangement.
The operator does not control the joint arrangement but acts within the financing and operating policies that have been agreed to by the investors in accordance with the contractual arrangement and delegated to the operator.
If the operator has the continuing power to determine the strategic operating, investing and financing policies of the enterprise without the co-operation of the other investors, it controls the arrangement and the arrangement is a subsidiary of the operator and not a joint arrangement (see SUBSIDIARIES, Section 1591).
Often, the activities of a joint arrangement are an extension of, or complementary to, those of the investors.
For example, joint arrangements are often formed to access new markets, to gain economies of scale or to access new skills and resources.
Joint arrangements may take various forms and structures such as partnerships, co-tenancies, corporate or unincorporated enterprises or undivided interests.
Whatever the form, joint arrangements may fall into one of the following broad categories, which are commonly described as, and meet the definition of, joint arrangements: jointly controlled operations, jointly controlled assets and jointly controlled enterprises.
The operations of some joint arrangements involve the use of the assets and other resources of the investors, rather than the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other enterprise, or a financial structure that is separate from the investors themselves.
Each investor uses its own property, plant and equipment and carries its own inventories for the purposes of the joint arrangement activities.
The assets remain under the ownership and control of each investor.
Each investor also incurs its own expenses and liabilities and raises its own financing, which represents its own obligations.
The joint arrangement activities may be carried out by the investor's employees alongside the investor's similar activities.
The contractual arrangement usually provides a means by which the revenue from the sale of goods or services by the joint arrangement and any expenses incurred in common are shared among the investors.
An example of jointly controlled operations is when two or more investors combine their operations, resources and expertise in order to manufacture, market and distribute jointly a particular product.
Different parts of the manufacturing process are carried out by each of the investors using their own assets and other resources.
Each investor bears its own costs and takes a share of the revenue from the sale of the product, such share being determined in accordance with the contractual arrangement.
Some joint arrangements involve the joint control, and often the joint ownership, by the investors of one or more assets contributed to, or acquired for the purpose of, the joint arrangement and dedicated to the purposes of the joint arrangement.
Jointly controlled assets are used to obtain benefits for the investors.
Each investor may take a share of the output from the assets and each bears an agreed share of the expenses incurred.
Such a joint arrangement does not involve the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other enterprise, or a financial structure that is separate from the investors themselves.
A jointly controlled enterprise is a joint arrangement that involves the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other enterprise in which each investor has an interest.
The enterprise operates in the same way as other enterprises, except that a contractual arrangement between the investors establishes joint control over the economic activity of the enterprise.
In a jointly controlled enterprise, each investor usually contributes cash or other resources to the joint arrangement.
The jointly controlled enterprise owns the assets of the joint arrangement, incurs liabilities and expenses and earns revenue.
It may enter into contracts in its own name and raise financing for the purposes of the joint arrangement activity.
Each investor is entitled to a share of the income of the jointly controlled enterprise, although some jointly controlled enterprises also involve a sharing of the output of the joint arrangement.
An example of a jointly controlled enterprise is when two or more enterprises combine their activities in a particular line of business by transferring the relevant assets and liabilities into a jointly controlled enterprise.
JOINTLY CONTROLLED OPERATIONS AND JOINTLY CONTROLLED ASSETS
An investor in jointly controlled operations or jointly controlled assets has rights to the individual assets and obligations for the individual liabilities relating to the joint arrangement.
An investor in a jointly controlled operation in which the investor has joint control shall recognize:
in its balance sheet, the assets that it controls and the liabilities that it incurs; and
in its income statement, its share of the revenue of the joint arrangement and its share of the expenses incurred by the joint arrangement.
An investor in jointly controlled assets in which the investor has joint control shall recognize:
in its balance sheet, its share of the jointly controlled assets and its share of any liabilities incurred jointly with the other investors in relation to the joint arrangement; and
in its income statement, any revenue from the sale or use of its share of the output of the joint arrangement, and its share of any expenses incurred by the joint arrangement.
When an investor transfers assets to a joint arrangement that consists of jointly controlled operations or jointly controlled assets and receives in exchange an interest in the joint arrangement that includes joint control, or sells assets in the normal course of operations to such a joint arrangement in which the investor has joint control, any gain or loss that occurs shall be recognized in income at the time of the transfer or sale to the extent of the interests of the other non-related investors.
When such a transaction provides evidence of a reduction in the net realizable value or a decline in the carrying amount of the relevant assets, the investor shall recognize this decline by writing down that portion of the assets retained through its interest in the joint arrangement and recognize the full amount of any loss in income.
When an investor transfers assets such as property, plant or equipment in the normal course of operations to a joint arrangement that consists of jointly controlled operations or jointly controlled assets in place of, or in addition to, any other contribution in exchange for an interest in the joint arrangement that includes joint control, and perhaps other assets, the investor gives up control over the assets transferred and acquires joint control over these assets.
The joint control arrangement binding the investors is an arm's length arrangement between the investors that establishes the sharing of control over the joint arrangement. Accordingly, the contributing investor is considered to be dealing at arm's length with the other non-related investors.
On this basis, an investor's contribution to such a joint arrangement is an arm's length transaction measured at fair value between the investor and the other non-related investors.
On these grounds, the contributing investor shall recognize that portion of the gain or loss attributable to the interest of the other non-related investors.
That portion of the gain or loss recognized is accounted for in accordance with paragraph 3056.19.
However, the existence of a loss at the time of the transfer would usually provide evidence of an impairment loss in the portion of the relevant assets retained by the investor through its interest in the joint arrangement and this decline in value is recognized by writing down that portion of the assets retained.
For example, when a loss occurs at the time of the transfer of capital assets to a joint arrangement that consists of jointly controlled operations or jointly controlled assets, any write-down of the portion of the capital assets retained by the investor through its interest in the joint arrangement shall be determined in accordance with GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, Section 3064, and IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, Section 3063.
Except as required in paragraph 3056.19, the portion of the gain or loss attributable to the investor's interest in the arrangement or to the interest of other related investors is recognized by the investor when the asset is sold by the joint arrangement to a third party or realized through the operations of the joint arrangement.
When a new investor and existing investors are not related parties (see RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, Section 3840) prior to the contribution to a joint arrangement of non-monetary assets, other than product or property held for sale in the normal course of operations to facilitate sales to customers, the change in control of the assets generally constitutes a change in the risk of the cash flows the investors expect to receive.
Accordingly, the contribution has commercial substance and is measured at fair value provided the fair value is reliably measurable (see NON-MONETARY TRANSACTIONS, Section 3831).
When the investors are related parties, the contribution is accounted for as a non-monetary transaction in accordance with Section 3840 or FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, Section 3856.
The substance of a transaction in the normal course of operations between an investor and a joint arrangement that consists of jointly controlled operations or jointly controlled assets and in which it has joint control would be examined to determine if the criteria for revenue recognition have been satisfied, such as the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership (see REVENUE, Section 3400).
An investor may sell assets in the normal course of operations to a joint arrangement that consists of jointly controlled operations or jointly controlled assets and in which the investor has joint control. If a gain or loss results to the investor, the gain or loss is considered to have been realized to the extent of the interest of the other non-related investors and recognition of that proportion is appropriate.
The portion of the gain or loss attributable to the investor's interest in the arrangement or to the interest of other related investors is recognized when the asset is sold to a third party.
However, when a sale of an asset to a joint arrangement has given rise to a loss, the investor recognizes the full loss in income immediately when the transaction provides evidence of a reduction in the net realizable value, or a decline in the value, of the relevant assets.
When an investor purchases assets in the normal course of operations from a joint arrangement that consists of jointly controlled operations or jointly controlled assets and in which it has joint control, the investor shall not recognize its share of the profit or loss of the joint arrangement on the transaction until the assets are sold to a third party.
However, when the transaction provides evidence of a reduction in the net realizable value, or a decline in the value of the relevant assets, the investor shall recognize its share of the loss in income immediately.
When an investor purchases assets in the normal course of operations from a joint arrangement that consists of jointly controlled operations or jointly controlled assets and in which it has joint control, the investor cannot recognize a profit on a transaction with itself.
Therefore, the investor does not recognize the portion of the joint arrangement profit that relates to its interest in the joint arrangement until the assets are sold to a third party.
When a transaction has given rise to a loss, the investor recognizes its share of the loss in the same way as profits, except that losses are recognized in income immediately when the transaction provides evidence of a reduction in the net realizable value, or a decline in the value, of the relevant assets.
JOINTLY CONTROLLED ENTERPRISES
An investor in a jointly controlled enterprise generally has rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement rather than rights to the individual assets and obligations for the individual liabilities.
Some jointly controlled enterprises are similar in substance to those joint arrangements referred to as jointly controlled operations or jointly controlled assets.
For example, the investors may transfer a jointly controlled asset, such as an oil pipeline, into a jointly controlled enterprise, for tax or other reasons.
Similarly, the investors may transfer into a jointly controlled enterprise assets that will be operated jointly.
An investor with an interest in a jointly controlled enterprise shall make an accounting policy choice to:
account for all such interests using the equity method (as defined in INVESTMENTS, Section 3051);
account for all such interests using the cost method (as defined in INVESTMENTS, Section 3051);or
perform an analysis of each such interest and determine whether it represents a right to the net assets or to the individual assets and obligations for the individual liabilities relating to the joint arrangement and:
account for all interests in the net assets of a jointly controlled enterprise in accordance with either paragraph 3056.29(a) or (b); and
account for all interests representing rights to the individual assets and obligations for the individual liabilities relating to a joint arrangement in accordance with paragraphs 3056.17-.18.
An investor shall account for all interests in jointly controlled enterprises using the same method (i.e., in accordance with paragraph 3056.29(a), (b) or (c)).
In making this accounting policy choice, the investor need not meet the criterion in ACCOUNTING CHANGES, paragraph 1506.06(b).
When a jointly controlled enterprise becomes a subsidiary of the investor because the investor has acquired control over the enterprise, the requirements of SUBSIDIARIES, Section 1591, apply.
When an investor ceases to have joint control over a jointly controlled enterprise (for example, when severe long-term restrictions are imposed on the ability of the jointly controlled enterprise to distribute its earnings to the investors), the investor accounts for its interest in accordance with INVESTMENTS, Section 3051, or FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, Section 3856, as appropriate.
An interest in a jointly controlled enterprise that is intended for disposal would continue to be recognized in the financial statements of the investor in accordance with paragraph 3056.29 until such time as the investor ceases to have joint control over the jointly controlled enterprise.
The provisions of DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, Section 3475, would apply if the interest to be disposed of meets the criteria in that Section to be classified as held for sale.
An investor with an interest in a jointly controlled enterprise shall account for its contributions to, and transactions with, the joint arrangement:
in accordance with INVESTMENTS, Section 3051, if the investor has applied paragraphs 3056.29(a), (b) or (c)(i); or
in accordance with paragraphs 3056.19-.26, if the investor has applied paragraph 3056.29(c)(ii).
The following shall be presented separately in the balance sheet:
subsidiaries and interests in joint arrangements accounted for using the equity method;
subsidiaries and interests in joint arrangements accounted for at cost;
other investments accounted for at cost.
Income from investments in the following shall be presented separately in the income statement:
A significant factor in evaluating the investment income is the relationship of the income reported to the investments from which such income is derived.
For this reason, investments reported in the balance sheet and investment income reported in the income statement are grouped in the same way.
The basis used to account for an investor's interest in a jointly controlled enterprise shall be disclosed.
An investor shall disclose its share of any contingencies and commitments of joint arrangements and those contingencies that exist when the investor is contingently liable for the liabilities of the other investors of the joint arrangements.
Separate disclosure of the investor's share of any contingencies and commitments of joint arrangements would include, as appropriate, the investor's share of any contingencies and commitments of joint arrangements and the investor's responsibility for the other investors' share of the contingencies of joint arrangements.
If an investor guarantees more than its share of a joint arrangement's liabilities, such a guarantee would be disclosed (see CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, Section 3280, and CONTINGENCIES, Section 3290).
For joint arrangements accounted for using the cost or equity method, an investor shall also provide the disclosures required by INVESTMENTS, Section 3051.
Other disclosure requirements are contained in other Sections, such as RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, Section 3840.
Except as specified in paragraphs 3056.43A and 3056.43C, this Section applies to annual financial statements for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
If an investor applies this Section before January 1, 2016, it discloses that fact and applies paragraphs 3051.14-.17 at the same time.
New paragraph 3056.43B, issued in December 2016, applies to annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
.43B
An enterprise can only apply paragraphs 3056.44-.49 when preparing its annual financial statements relating to the first fiscal year in which Section 3056 is effective.
.43C
Amendments to paragraph 3056.22, issued in December 2018, apply to annual financial statements related to periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021.
When changing from proportionate consolidation to the cost or equity method, an investor recognizes its investment in the joint arrangement as at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
That initial investment is measured as the aggregate of the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities that the investor had previously proportionately consolidated, including any goodwill arising from acquisition.
The investor allocates any goodwill to the joint arrangement on the basis of the relative carrying amounts of the joint arrangement and the reporting unit to which it belonged.
This approach is consistent with that for the allocation of goodwill on the disposal of a portion of a reporting unit in GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, Section 3064.
An investor assesses whether the opening balance of the investment is impaired in accordance with the impairment provisions in INVESTMENTS, Section 3051.
Any impairment loss is recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
If aggregating all previously proportionately consolidated assets and liabilities results in negative net assets, an investor assesses whether it has legal or constructive obligations in relation to the negative net assets and, if so, the investor recognizes the corresponding liability.
If the investor concludes that it does not have legal or constructive obligations in relation to the negative net assets, it does not recognize the corresponding liability but it adjusts opening retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
After initial recognition, an investor accounts for its investment in the joint arrangement using the cost or equity method in accordance with INVESTMENTS, Section 3051.
An investor discloses a breakdown of the assets and liabilities that have been aggregated into the single line investment balance as at the beginning of the earliest period presented, together with any adjustment to opening retained earnings made in accordance with paragraphs 3056.45-.46.
That disclosure is prepared in an aggregated manner for all joint arrangements for which an investor applies the transition requirements referred to in paragraphs 3056.44-.47.
This Appendix provides additional guidance for applying paragraph 3056.29(c) to determine whether an investor has rights to the net assets or to the individual assets and obligations for the individual liabilities in a jointly controlled enterprise.
Assessing the terms of the contractual arrangement
Assessing other facts and circumstances
Decision tree – Classification of an investor's interest in a jointly controlled enterprise
Paragraph 3056.29(c) provides an investor that has an interest in a jointly controlled enterprise an accounting policy choice to perform an analysis to determine whether its interest represents:
a right to the net assets, which is accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 3056.29(a) or (b); or
a right to the individual assets and obligations for the individual liabilities, which is accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 3056.17-.18 and is consistent with the accounting for a jointly controlled operation or jointly controlled asset.
A jointly controlled enterprise generally confers separation between the investors and the assets and obligations of the joint arrangement, so that the investors have rights to the net assets of the jointly controlled enterprise rather than rights to the individual assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement.
The legal form of the enterprise is relevant when assessing the investors' rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement.
However, the terms agreed to by the investors in their contractual arrangement (see paragraphs 3056.A3-.A6) and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances (see paragraphs 3056.A7-.A11) can override the assessment of the rights and obligations conferred upon the investors by the legal form of the jointly controlled enterprise.
In many cases, the rights and obligations agreed to by the investors in their contractual arrangements are consistent, or do not conflict, with the rights and obligations conferred on the investors by the legal form of the jointly controlled enterprise in which the arrangement has been structured.
In other cases, the investors use the contractual arrangement to override or modify the rights and obligations conferred by the legal form of the jointly controlled enterprise in which the arrangement has been structured.
The following table compares common terms in contractual arrangements that provide investors with rights to the net assets of jointly controlled enterprises and those that provide rights to the individual assets and obligations for the individual liabilities of jointly controlled enterprises.
The examples of the contractual terms provided in the following table are not exhaustive.
Investor has rights to the individual assets and obligations for the individual liabilities of a jointly controlled enterprise
Investor has rights to the net assets of a jointly controlled enterprise
The terms of the contractual arrangement
The contractual arrangement provides investors in the jointly controlled enterprise with rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the jointly controlled enterprise.
The contractual arrangement provides investors in the jointly controlled enterprise with rights to the net assets of the jointly controlled enterprise (i.e., it is the jointly controlled enterprise, not the investors, that has rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the jointly controlled enterprise).
Rights to assets
The contractual arrangement establishes that the investors in the jointly controlled enterprise share all interests (for example, rights, title or ownership) in the assets relating to the jointly controlled enterprise in a specified proportion (for example, in proportion to the investors' ownership interest in the jointly controlled enterprise or in proportion to the activity carried out through the jointly controlled enterprise that is directly attributed to them).
The contractual arrangement establishes that the assets brought into the jointly controlled enterprise or subsequently acquired by the jointly controlled enterprise are the jointly controlled enterprise's assets.
The investors have no interests (i.e., no rights, title or ownership) in the assets of the jointly controlled enterprise.
Obligations for liabilities
The contractual arrangement establishes that the investors in the jointly controlled enterprise share all liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses in a specified proportion (for example, in proportion to the investors' ownership interest in the jointly controlled enterprise or in proportion to the activity carried out through the jointly controlled enterprise that is directly attributed to them).
The contractual arrangement establishes that the jointly controlled enterprise is liable for its own debts and obligations.
The contractual arrangement establishes that the investors in the jointly controlled enterprise are liable to the jointly controlled enterprise only to the extent of their respective investments in the jointly controlled enterprise or to their respective obligations to contribute any unpaid or additional capital to the jointly controlled enterprise, or both.
The contractual arrangement establishes that the investors in the jointly controlled enterprise are liable for claims raised by third parties.
The contractual arrangement states that creditors of the jointly controlled enterprise do not have rights of recourse against any investor with respect to debts or obligations of the jointly controlled enterprise.
Revenues, expenses, profit or loss
The contractual arrangement establishes the allocation of revenues and expenses on the basis of the relative performance of each investor in the jointly controlled enterprise.
For example, the contractual arrangement might establish that revenues and expenses are allocated on the basis of the capacity that each investor uses in a plant operated jointly, which could differ from their ownership interest in the jointly controlled enterprise.
In other instances, the investors might have agreed to share the profit or loss relating to the arrangement on the basis of a specified proportion such as the investors' ownership interest in the arrangement.
This would not change an investor's assessment of its rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the jointly controlled enterprise.
The contractual arrangement establishes each investor's share in the profit or loss relating to the activities of the jointly controlled enterprise.
Guarantees
The investors in jointly controlled enterprises are often required to provide guarantees to third parties that, for example, receive a service from, or provide financing to, the jointly controlled enterprise.
The provision of such guarantees, or the commitment by the investors to provide them, does not, by itself, determine that the investor has obligations for the liabilities relating to the jointly controlled enterprise.
When the contractual arrangement specifies that the investors have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the jointly controlled enterprise, they account for their interests in accordance with paragraphs 3056.17-.18 and do not need to consider other facts and circumstances (see paragraphs 3056.A7-.A11) for the purposes of determining their rights in the jointly controlled enterprise.
When the terms of the contractual arrangement do not specify that the investors have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the jointly controlled enterprise, the investors should consider other facts and circumstances to assess their rights in the jointly controlled enterprise.
The contractual terms agreed among the investors might not specify the investors' rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, yet consideration of other facts and circumstances can lead to such investors having rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
When the activities of a jointly controlled enterprise are primarily designed for the provision of output to the investors, this indicates that the investors have rights to substantially all the economic benefits of the assets of the jointly controlled enterprise.
The investors to such arrangements often ensure their access to the outputs provided by the jointly controlled enterprise by preventing the arrangement from selling output to third parties.
The effect of a jointly controlled enterprise with such a design and purpose is that the liabilities incurred by the jointly controlled enterprise are, in substance, satisfied by the cash flows received from the investors through their purchases of the output.
When the investors are substantially the only source of cash flows contributing to the continuity of the operations of the jointly controlled enterprise, this indicates that the investors have an obligation for the liabilities relating to the jointly controlled enterprise.
The following decision tree reflects the assessment an investor follows to determine the type of interest it has in a jointly controlled enterprise:

Benefit Plans and Fair Value Disclosure by Pension Plans — Amendments to Section 4600 — Background Information and Basis for Conclusions
Foreword
In May 2012 and July 2012, the Accounting Standards Board (AcSB) amended PENSION PLANS, Section 4600, in Part IV of the CICA Handbook – Accounting, to make clarifications with respect to benefit plans and fair value disclosures, respectively.
The AcSB has approved for publication the contents of this document setting out its rationale for the amendments.
Background Information and Basis for Conclusions documents are intended to help readers understand how the AcSB reached its conclusions, but they do not include explanations of requirements or guidance on the application of the Handbook.

INTRODUCTION
It sets out the reasons the AcSB undertook the project to develop these amendments, the process of research and deliberation, the key decisions made, and the principal reasons for adopting the positions taken and rejecting others.
Individual AcSB members gave greater weight to some factors than to others.
However, the discussion may help readers understand how the AcSB reached its conclusions in developing the amendments and the AcSB's intent with respect to its interpretation and application.
BENEFIT PLANS
"A benefit plan is any arrangement whereby an entity undertakes to provide its employees with benefits after active service in exchange for their services." [Emphasis added.]
"The Exposure Draft [AcSB's July 2009 Exposure Draft, "Pension Plans"] proposed to permit benefit plans with characteristics similar to pension plans to apply the standards.
The AcSB decided that such plans should be required to do so.
This change enhances the comparability between financial statements of different benefit plans and between financial statements of pension plans and benefit plans other than pension plans.
Stakeholders also suggested that the scope not be limited to "retirement benefit plans" but be expanded to include non-retirement benefit plans that have characteristics similar to pension plans (for example, long-term disability plans).
The AcSB agreed with this suggestion."
The AcSB's intent, as described in the Background Information and Basis for Conclusions for Pension Plans, was to include plans providing benefits to employees during and after active service.
They also noted that some plans provide benefits both during and after active service.
See paragraphs 3-5 of the Background Information and Basis for Conclusions for Pension Plans for the rationale for that decision.
Thus, the AcSB decided to retain benefit plans within the scope of Section 4600.
It did so for the same reasons noted during the development of Part IV of the Handbook:
to ensure that these plans present their obligation on the face of their financial statements, similar to pension plans; and
to alert financial statement users to their funded status because most benefit plans are unfunded.
Therefore, the AcSB decided to amend the definition of a benefit plan to clarify that benefit plans providing benefits to employees during their active service are within the scope of Section 4600.
The AcSB made a corresponding amendment to the definition of a benefit plan in the Preface.
Earlier application was permitted to allow plans that had not yet completed their financial statements for 2011 to apply this amendment.
The AcSB also made provision for annual reporting periods that differ from calendar years.
However, the AcSB decided to forgo exposure for the following reasons:
Consequently, the AcSB decided that it had already received sufficient feedback on including benefit plans that provide benefits during active service within the scope of Part IV of the Handbook.
IFRS 13 includes consequential amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures that deleted the fair value disclosure requirements in that standard.
That deletion was made because similar fair value disclosures are required by IFRS 13.
However, the transition paragraph in Section 4600 for application of IFRS 13 specifies that a pension plan {§2} 2 that has adopted IFRS 13 is not required to provide the disclosures included in that standard.
That provision was included because the AcSB intends to undertake a comprehensive review of the disclosure requirements of Section 4600 and did not wish to add any new disclosure requirements until that review was completed.
Thus, some disclosures about fair value for a pension plan's investments that are financial instruments should be made by a pension plan applying Section 4600.
Other pension plans may agree that some fair value disclosures are required but decide that not all the fair value disclosures formerly in paragraphs 27-27B of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures are necessary for fair presentation.
Accordingly, the AcSB decided to amend Section 4600 to clarify that the fair value disclosures in paragraphs 27-27B of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures that were deleted from that standard as a consequence of incorporating IFRS 13 into Part I of the Handbook will continue to be required for pension plans that have adopted the measurement requirements of IFRS 13.
This decision is consistent with the AcSB's previous decisions:
not to amend the disclosure requirements when it amended Section 4600 for fair value measurement; and
that a pension plan that adopts IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement should not be required to provide the disclosures required by that standard.
The Appendix to Section 4600 simply reproduces those disclosures.
That project would reconsider the disclosure requirements in Section 4600 as a result of the issuance of IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, as well as clarifications to the disclosure requirements for defined contribution plans.
1. In this document, the term "benefit plan" does not include pension plans.
Section 4600 also applies to general purpose financial  statements of benefit plans that have characteristics similar to pension plans and provide benefits other than pensions.

Discontinued Operations
Amendments to Section 3475 —
Background Information and Basis for Conclusions
In May 2013, the Accounting Standards Board (AcSB) amended DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, Section 3475 in Part II of the CICA Handbook – Accounting, to amend the definition of a discontinued operation.
Background Information and Basis for Conclusions documents are sources of generally accepted accounting principles, as described in GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, Section 1100 in Part II of the Handbook.
These documents are intended to help readers understand how the AcSB reached its conclusions, but they do not include explanations of requirements or guidance on the application of the relevant Section or Accounting Guideline.

It sets out the reasons the AcSB undertook the project to develop the amendments, the process of research and deliberation, the key decisions made, and the principal reasons for adopting the positions taken and rejecting others.
However, the discussion may help readers understand how the AcSB reached its conclusions in developing the amendments and the AcSB's intent with respect to its interpretation and application.
BACKGROUND AND EFFECTS ANALYSIS
The AcSB noted that these criteria were often difficult to apply, resulting in divergence in practice.
Consequently, the AcSB considered the effect on financial statement users of limiting the disposals classified as discontinued operations to those required by IFRS 5.
Those disclosures ensured that users are aware of disposals, enabling them to ask for additional information, if necessary.
The information provided by presenting discontinued operations separately in the financial statements, including data for comparative years, is useful for large disposals that represent a shift in strategy or tactics.
However, the inclusion of many less significant disposals, often made for ongoing operational reasons, does not provide significant additional value to users.
Therefore, users agreed with changing the criteria to focus on more significant disposals.
This amendment would provide users with the information that they require while reducing the costs for preparers.
Respondents were primarily from public accounting firms and generally expressed agreement with the proposals set out in the Exposure Draft.
EXPOSURE DRAFT COMMENTS
The AcSB felt that the definition of a discontinued operation, which refers to "a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations" provided sufficient guidance.
Professional judgment would have to be applied to the facts and circumstances of specific situations to determine if a single geographic location were to meet the definition of a discontinued operation.
The AcSB noted that the previous standard was clear that such components are discontinued operations and it did not intend to change the standard on that issue.
