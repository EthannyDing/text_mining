Hedges of portions of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities for risk other than foreign currency risk (paragraph 82)
Whether to permit hedge accounting using cash instruments
Whether to treat hedges of forecast transactions as fair value hedges
Fair value hedge accounting for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk
Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting
The Board's decisions with regard to these issues are presented in the following paragraphs.
Qualification for hedge accounting is based on expectations of future effectiveness (prospective) and evaluation of actual effectiveness (retrospective).
The Board noted that an undesirable consequence of such an amendment could be that entities would deliberately underhedge a hedged item in a cash flow hedge so as to reduce recognised ineffectiveness.
The Board noted that the objective of the test was to ensure there was firm evidence to support an expectation of high effectiveness.
Therefore, the Board decided to amend the Standard to clarify that an expectation of high effectiveness may be demonstrated in various ways, including a comparison of past changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk with past changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument, or by demonstrating a high statistical correlation between the fair value of cash flows of the hedged item and those of the hedging instrument.
Moreover, the Board noted that permitting portions of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities to be designated as the hedged item for risk other than foreign currency risk would compromise the principles of identification of the hedged item and effectiveness testing that the Board has confirmed because the portion could be designated so that no ineffectiveness would ever arise.
The Board confirmed that non-financial items may be hedged in their entirety when the item the entity is hedging is not the standard item underlying contracts traded in the market.
The Board considered the argument that interest rate risk can be separately identified and measured in loan servicing rights, and that changes in market interest rates have a predictable and separately measurable effect on the value of loan servicing rights.
The Board also considered the possibility of treating loan servicing rights as financial assets (rather than non-financial assets).
However, the Board concluded that no exceptions should be permitted for this matter.
The Board noted that (a) the interest rate risk and prepayment risk in loan servicing rights are interdependent, and thus inseparable, (b) the fair values of loan servicing rights do not change in a linear fashion as interest rates increase or decrease, and (c) concerns exist about how to isolate and measure the interest rate risk portion of a loan servicing right.
Moreover, the Board expressed concern that in jurisdictions in which loan servicing right markets are not developed, the interest rate risk portion may not be measurable.
The Exposure Draft did not propose a change to this limitation.
However, some commentators suggested a change, noting that entities do not distinguish between derivative and non-derivative financial instruments in their hedging and other risk management activities and that entities may have to use a non-derivative financial instrument to hedge risk if no suitable derivative financial instrument exists.
The Board acknowledged that some entities use non-derivatives to manage risk.
However, it decided to retain the restriction against designating non-derivatives as hedging instruments in hedges of risks other than foreign currency risk.
It noted the following arguments in support of this conclusion
Without hedge accounting, an entity might recognise volatility in profit or loss for matched positions.
For non-derivative items that are not measured at fair value or for which changes in fair value are not recognised in profit or loss, there is generally no need to adjust the accounting of the hedging instrument or the hedged item to achieve matched recognition of gains and losses in profit or loss.
More financial instruments would be measured at an amount that represents neither amortised cost nor fair value.
Hedge accounting is, and should be, an exception to the normal measurement requirements.
The Board considered a suggestion made in some of the comment letters received on the Exposure Draft that a hedge of a forecast transaction should be treated as a fair value hedge, rather than as a cash flow hedge.
It noted that removing either type of hedge accounting would narrow the range of hedging strategies that could qualify for hedge accounting.
The Board also noted that treating a hedge of a forecast transaction as a fair value hedge is not appropriate for the following reasons: (a) it would result in the recognition of an asset or liability before the entity has become a party to the contract; (b) amounts would be recognised in the balance sheet that do not meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Framework; and (c) transactions in which there is no fair value exposure would be treated as if there were a fair value exposure.
Some believe this is appropriate because cash flow hedge accounting for hedges of firm commitments avoids partial recognition of the firm commitment that would otherwise not be recognised.
Moreover, some believe it is conceptually incorrect to recognise the hedged fair value exposure of a firm commitment as an asset or liability merely because it has been hedged.
The Board noted that, in concept, a hedge of a firm commitment is a fair value hedge.
This is because the fair value of the item being hedged (the firm commitment) changes with changes in the hedged risk.
The Board was not persuaded by the argument that it is conceptually incorrect to recognise an asset or liability for a firm commitment merely because it has been hedged.
It noted that for all fair value hedges, applying hedge accounting has the effect that amounts are recognised as assets or liabilities that would otherwise not be recognised.
For example, assume an entity hedges a fixed rate loan asset with a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap.
If there is a loss on the swap, applying fair value hedge accounting requires the offsetting gain on the loan to be recognised, ie the carrying amount of the loan is increased.
Thus, applying hedge accounting has the effect of recognising a part of an asset (the increase in the loan's value attributable to interest rate movements) that would otherwise not have been recognised.
However, the Board clarified that a hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment may be treated as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge because foreign currency risk affects both the cash flows and the fair value of the hedged item.
Accordingly a foreign currency cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction need not be re-designated as a fair value hedge when the forecast transaction becomes a firm commitment.
The question of basis adjustment arises when an entity hedges the future purchase of an asset or the future issue of a liability.
The entity enters into a derivative to hedge against possible future changes in the US dollar / euro exchange rate.
In its deliberations on this issue, the Board discussed the following approaches
In future periods, the hedging gain or loss is automatically recognised in profit or loss by being included in amounts such as depreciation expense (for a fixed asset), interest income or expense (for a financial asset or financial liability), or cost of sales (for inventories).
This treatment is commonly referred to as 'basis adjustment'.
This recycling requires a separate adjustment and is not automatic.
It should be noted that both approaches have the same effect on profit or loss and net assets for all periods affected, so long as the hedge is accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
The difference relates to balance sheet presentation and, possibly, the line item in the income statement.
In the Exposure Draft, the Board proposed that the 'basis adjustment' approach for forecast transactions (approach (a)) should be eliminated and replaced by approach (b) above.
Many of the comments received from constituents disagreed with the proposal in the Exposure Draft.
Those responses argued that it would unnecessarily complicate the accounting to leave the hedging gain or loss in equity when the hedged forecast transaction occurs.
They particularly noted that tracking the effects of cash flow hedges after the asset or liability is acquired would be complicated and would require systems changes.
They also pointed out that treating hedges of firm commitments as fair value hedges has the same effect as a basis adjustment when the firm commitment results in the recognition of an asset or liability.
For example, for a perfectly effective hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment to buy a machine, the effect is to recognise the machine initially at its foreign currency price translated at the forward rate in effect at the inception of the hedge rather than the spot rate.
Therefore, they questioned whether it is consistent to treat a hedge of a firm commitment as a fair value hedge while precluding basis adjustments for hedges of forecast transactions.
Others believe that a basis adjustment is difficult to justify in principle for forecast transactions, and also argue that such basis adjustments impair comparability of financial information.
Basis adjustments for hedges of forecast transactions that will result in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability
For hedges of forecast transactions that will result in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the Board concluded that basis adjustments are not appropriate.
The occurrence of the forecast cash flows is deemed to be highly probable and all the other relevant hedge accounting criteria are met.
Basis adjustments for hedges of forecast transactions that will result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability
For hedges of forecast transactions that will result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the Board decided to permit entities a choice of whether to apply basis adjustment.
The Board considered the argument that changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are appropriately included in the initial carrying amount of the recognised asset or liability because such changes represent a part of the 'cost' of that asset or liability.
Although the Board has not yet considered the broader issue of what costs may be capitalised at initial recognition, the Board believes that its decision to provide an option for basis adjustments in the case of non-financial items will not pre-empt that future discussion.
The Board also recognised that financial items and non-financial items are not necessarily measured at the same amount on initial recognition, because financial items are measured at fair value and non-financial items are measured at cost.
The Board concluded that, on balance, providing entities with a choice in this case was appropriate.
The Board took the view that allowing basis adjustments addresses the concern that precluding basis adjustments complicates the accounting for hedges of forecast transactions.
The Board also noted that US GAAP precludes basis adjustments and that applying a basis adjustment is inconsistent with the accounting for hedges of forecast transactions that will result in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability.
The Board acknowledged the merits of these arguments, and recognised that by permitting a choice in IAS 39, entities could apply the accounting treatment required by US GAAP.
The reason is the fundamental requirement of consolidation that the accounting effects of internal contracts should be eliminated in consolidated financial statements, including any internally generated gains or losses.
Designating internal contracts as hedging instruments could result in non-elimination of internal gains and losses and have other accounting effects.
The Exposure Draft did not propose any change in this area.
To illustrate, assume the banking book division of Bank A enters into an internal interest rate swap with the trading book division of the same bank.
The purpose is to hedge the net interest rate risk exposure in the banking book of a group of similar fixed rate loan assets funded by floating rate liabilities.
Under the swap, the banking book pays fixed interest payments to the trading book and receives variable interest rate payments in return.
The bank wants to designate the internal interest rate swap in the banking book as a hedging instrument in its consolidated financial statements.
If the internal swap in the banking book is designated as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge of the liabilities, and the internal swap in the trading book is classified as held for trading, internal gains and losses on that internal swap would not be eliminated.
If the internal swap in the banking book is designated as a hedging instrument in a fair value hedge of the loan assets and the internal swap in the trading book is classified as held for trading, the changes in the fair value of the internal swap would offset both in total net assets in the balance sheet and profit or loss.
However, without elimination of the internal swap, there would be an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged loan asset in the banking book to reflect the change in the fair value attributable to the risk hedged by the internal contract.
Moreover, to reflect the effect of the internal swap the bank would in effect recognise the fixed rate loan at a floating interest rate and recognise an offsetting trading gain or loss in the income statement.
Hence the internal swap would have accounting effects.
Some respondents to the Exposure Draft and some participants in the round-tables objected to not being able to obtain hedge accounting in the consolidated financial statements for internal contracts between subsidiaries or between a subsidiary and the parent (as illustrated above).
Among other things, they emphasised that the use of internal contracts is a key risk management tool and that the accounting should reflect the way in which risk is managed.
In considering these comments, the Board noted that the following principles apply to consolidated financial statements
Permitting the designation of internal contracts as hedging instruments would require a change to the consolidation principles.
It is not the purpose of accounting standards to prescribe how entities should manage and control risks.
In that case, the effect from the entity's perspective is to designate a hedging relationship between the net external derivative and a net position of an asset and a liability.
(iii) the option to fair value assets and liabilities does not extend to portions of assets and liabilities.
The Board believes that that is a better way to address the concerns raised about symmetry with risk management systems than permitting the designation of internal contracts as hedging instruments.
This enables an entity to measure matching asset / liability positions at fair value without a need for hedge accounting.
The Board reaffirmed that it is a fundamental principle of consolidation that any accounting effect of internal contracts is eliminated on consolidation.
In doing so, they used a segment as an example of a reporting entity.
This followed a request by the IFRIC for guidance.
the designation of inflation as a hedged risk or portion in particular situations.
BC172E After considering the responses to the exposure draft, the Board confirmed that the designation set out in paragraph BC172D is not permitted.
The Board noted that the forecast transaction contained no separately identifiable risk that affects profit or loss that is equivalent to the time value of a purchased option hedging instrument (with the same principal terms as the designated risk).
The Board then considered a purchased option designated in its entirety as the hedging instrument.
The Board noted that hedge accounting is based on a principle of offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
Designation of inflation in particular situations
However, the Board also noted that hedge accounting is an exception to normal accounting principles for the hedged item (fair value hedges) or hedging instrument (cash flow hedges).
To ensure a disciplined use of hedge accounting the Board noted that restrictions regarding eligible hedged items are necessary, especially if something other than the entire fair value or cash flow variability of a hedged item is designated.
For example, an entity may designate some (but not all) risks of a financial instrument, or some (but not all) cash flows of a financial instrument (a 'portion').
BC172J The Board noted that, to be eligible for hedge accounting, the designated risks and portions must be separately identifiable components of the financial instrument, and changes in the fair value or cash flows of the entire financial instrument arising from changes in the designated risks and portions must be reliably measurable.
The Board also noted that deciding whether designated risks and portions are separately identifiable and reliably measurable requires judgement.
However, the Board confirmed that unless the inflation portion is a contractually specified portion of cash flows and other cash flows of the financial instrument are not affected by the inflation portion, inflation is not separately identifiable and reliably measurable and is not eligible for designation as a hedged risk or portion of a financial instrument.
However, some of the comment letters on the Exposure Draft and participants in the round-table discussions raised this issue.
not qualified for hedge accounting at all, with the result that reported profit or loss would be volatile; or
qualified only for cash flow hedge accounting, with the result that reported equity would be volatile.
Paragraphs BC135A–BC136B and BC175–BC220 summarise the Board's considerations in reaching conclusions on the issues raised.
In making this decision it noted that
the issues that arise for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk are different from those that arise for hedges of individual items and for hedges of other risks.
Such assets contain a prepayment option whose fair value changes as interest rates change.
However, the derivative that is used as the hedging instrument typically is not prepayable, ie it does not contain a prepayment option.
However, for risk management purposes, entities often seek to hedge the net position.
This net position changes each period as items are repriced or derecognised and as new items are originated.
Hence, the individual items designated as the hedged item also need to be changed each period.
This requires de- and redesignation of the individual items that constitute the hedged item, which gives rise to significant systems needs.
derivatives should be measured at fair value;
only items that are assets and liabilities should be recognised as such in the balance sheet.
Deferred losses are not assets and deferred gains are not liabilities.
However, if an asset or liability is hedged, any change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk should be recognised in the balance sheet.
In considering the issue described in paragraph BC176(a), the Board noted that a prepayable item can be viewed as a combination of a non-prepayable item and a prepayment option.
the fair value of the contracted cash flows to the contractual repricing date changes (because the rate used to discount them changes); and
the fair value of the prepayment option changes (reflecting, among other things, that the likelihood of prepayment is affected by interest rates).
Instead they incorporate the effect of prepayments by grouping the hedged portfolio into repricing time periods based on expected repayment dates (rather than contractual repayment dates).
The entity schedules all other items contained in its portfolio in a similar way (ie on the basis of expected repayment dates) and hedges all or part of the resulting overall net position in each repricing time period.
The Board decided to permit the scheduling that is used for risk management purposes, ie on the basis of expected repayment dates, to be used as a basis for the designation necessary for hedge accounting.
As a result, an entity would not be required to compute the effect that a change in interest rates has on the fair value of the prepayment option embedded in a prepayable item.
Instead, it could incorporate the effect of a change in interest rates on prepayments by grouping the hedged portfolio into repricing time periods based on expected repayment dates.
The Board noted that this approach has significant practical advantages for preparers of financial statements, because it allows them to use the data they use for risk management.
However, as discussed further in paragraphs BC193–BC206, the Board also concluded that if the entity changes its estimates of the time periods in which items are expected to repay (eg in the light of recent prepayment experience), ineffectiveness will arise, regardless of whether the revision in estimates results in more or less being scheduled in a particular time period.
Instead, the financial assets or financial liabilities included in a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk need only share the risk being hedged.
Designation of the hedged item and liabilities with a demand feature
Management's decisions about additional hedging focus on the entity's remaining net exposure.
They observe that designation based on a portion of either the assets or the liabilities is not consistent with existing ALM systems and would entail additional systems costs.
In considering questions of designation, the Board was also concerned about questions of measurement.
In particular, the Board observed that fair value hedge accounting requires measurement of the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged.
Designation based on the net position would require the assets and the liabilities in a portfolio each to be measured at fair value (for the risk being hedged) in order to compute the fair value of the net position.
Although statistical and other techniques can be used to estimate these fair values, the Board concluded that it is not appropriate to assume that the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is equal to the change in fair value of the net position.
This includes items such as demand deposits and some types of time deposits.
The Board was informed that, when managing interest rate risk, many entities that have demandable liabilities include them in a portfolio hedge by scheduling them to the date when they expect the total amount of demandable liabilities in the portfolio to be due because of net withdrawals from the accounts in the portfolio.
The Board was also informed that some entities wish to apply fair value hedge accounting based on this scheduling, ie they wish to include demandable liabilities in a fair value portfolio hedge by scheduling them on the basis of their expected repayment dates.
Interest rate risk management involves hedging the interest rate margin resulting from assets and liabilities and not the fair value of all or part of the assets and liabilities included in the hedged portfolio.
The interest rate margin of a specific period is subject to variability as soon as the amount of fixed rate assets in that period differs from the amount of fixed rate liabilities in that period.
Hence, entities regard this base level as a long-term fixed rate item and include it as such in the scheduling that is used for risk management purposes.
The portfolio behaves like a long-term item even if individual liabilities do not.
The Board noted that this issue is related to that of how to measure the fair value of a demandable liability.
Put another way, the balance of the portfolio is relatively stable only because withdrawals on some accounts (which usually occur relatively quickly) are offset by new deposits into others.
Thus, the liability being hedged is actually the forecast replacement of existing deposits by the receipt of new deposits.
Also, for both, there is an amount—the base level—that is expected to be stable and present indefinitely.
That fair value is unaffected by interest rates and does not change when interest rates move.
For these reasons, the Board concluded that demandable liabilities should not be included in a portfolio hedge on the basis of the expected repayment date of the total balance of a portfolio of demandable liabilities, ie including expected rollovers or replacements of existing deposits by new ones.
However, as part of its consideration of comments received on the Exposure Draft, the Board also considered whether a demandable liability, such as a demand deposit, could be included in a portfolio hedge based on the expected repayment date of the existing balance of individual deposits, ie ignoring any rollovers or replacements of existing deposits by new deposits.
The Board noted the following.
However, for other demandable liabilities, such as fixed term deposits that can be withdrawn only by the depositor incurring a significant penalty, it might imply an expected repayment date that is closer to that assumed for risk management.
The Board noted that it would be inconsistent to permit fair value hedge accounting to be based on the expected repayment date, but to measure the fair value of the liability on initial recognition on a different basis.
The Board did not reach a conclusion on what the difference represents, but agreed that if it were to require such differences to be recognised, this would apply to all demandable liabilities, not only to those included in a portfolio hedge.
Such a requirement would represent a significant change from present practice.
Hence, the fair value of the deposit will be significantly less sensitive to interest rate changes than that of the hedging instrument.
The Board's discussions in these other projects are continuing and it would be premature to reach a conclusion in the context of portfolio hedging without considering the implications for these other projects.
consequently, that a demandable liability cannot qualify for fair value hedge accounting for any time period beyond the shortest period in which the counterparty can demand payment.
The Board noted that, depending on the outcome of its discussions in other projects (principally Insurance (phase II), Revenue Recognition, Leases and Measurement), it might reconsider these decisions at some time in the future.
The Board also noted that what is designated as the hedged item in a portfolio hedge affects the relevance of this issue, at least to some extent.
In particular, if the hedged item is designated as a portion of the assets in a portfolio, this issue is irrelevant.
Also assume that all of the liabilities are demandable liabilities and the time period is later than that containing the earliest date on which the items can be repaid.
In such a case, whether the demandable liabilities can be designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge is irrelevant.
Given the above points, the Board decided that a portion of assets or liabilities (rather than an overall net position) may be designated as the hedged item, to overcome part of the demandable liabilities issue.
However, the Board also recognised that this method of designation would not fully resolve the demandable liabilities issue.
In particular, the issue is still relevant if, in a particular repricing time period, the entity has so many demandable liabilities whose earliest repayment date is before that time period that (a) they comprise nearly all of what the entity regards as its fixed rate liabilities and (b) its fixed rate liabilities (including the demandable liabilities) exceed its fixed rate assets in this repricing time period.
In this case, the entity is in a net liability position.
Thus, it needs to designate an amount of the liabilities as the hedged item.
But unless it has sufficient fixed rate liabilities other than those that can be demanded before that time period, this implies designating the demandable liabilities as the hedged item.
Consistently with the Board's decision discussed above, such a hedge does not qualify for fair value hedge accounting.
(If the liabilities are non-interest bearing, they cannot be designated as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge because their cash flows do not vary with changes in interest rates, ie there is no cash flow exposure to interest rates.
What portion of assets should be designated and the impact on ineffectiveness
Having decided that a portion of assets (or liabilities) could be designated as the hedged item, the Board considered how to overcome the systems problems noted in paragraph BC176(b) and (c).
The Board noted that these problems arise from designating individual assets (or liabilities) as the hedged item.
Accordingly, the Board decided that the hedged item could be expressed as an amount (of assets or liabilities) rather than as individual assets or liabilities.
The Board noted that this decision—that the hedged item may be designated as an amount of assets or liabilities rather than as specified items—gives rise to the issue of how the amount designated should be specified.
The Board considered comments received on the Exposure Draft that it should not specify any method for designating the hedged item and hence measuring effectiveness.
However, the Board concluded that if it provided no guidance, entities might designate in different ways, resulting in little comparability between them.
The Board also noted that its objective, when permitting an amount to be designated, was to overcome the systems problems associated with designating individual items whilst achieving a very similar accounting result.
Accordingly, it concluded that it should require a method of designation that closely approximates the accounting result that would be achieved by designating individual items.
Additionally, the Board noted that designation determines how much, if any, ineffectiveness arises if actual repricing dates in a particular repricing time period vary from those estimated or if the estimated repricing dates are revised.
The Board noted that the layer approach does not result in the recognition of ineffectiveness in all cases when the estimated amount of assets (or liabilities) changes.
Thus, if the bottom layer is designated as the hedged item, it is unlikely that the hedged (bottom) layer will be reached and that any ineffectiveness will arise.
Arguments for and against the layer approach
The arguments for the layer approach are as follows
Any changes to the portfolio because of changes in prepayments do not affect how effective the hedge was in mitigating interest rate risk.
So long as assets equal to the hedged layer remain, there is no ineffectiveness and upward revisions of the amount in a repricing time period do not affect the hedged layer.
The designation of a bottom layer can be viewed as hedging a part of the life of the non-prepayable item, but none of the prepayment option.
If the position is viewed in this way, no ineffectiveness arises when interest rate changes cause the value of the prepayment option to change (unless the option is exercised and the asset prepaid) because the prepayment option was not hedged.
The arguments against the layer approach are as follows
When interest rates change, the fair value of both of these components changes.
If individual prepayable assets had been designated as the hedged item, the change in both the components noted in (c) above (to the extent they are attributable to the hedged risk) would be recognised in profit or loss, both when interest rates increase and when they decrease.
Accordingly, the change in the fair value of the hedged asset would differ from the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative (unless that derivative includes an equivalent prepayment option) and ineffectiveness would be recognised for the difference.
It follows that in the simplified approach of designating the hedged item as an amount, ineffectiveness should similarly arise.
Accordingly, when interest rates change, the fair value of the hedged assets (which include a prepayment option whose fair value has changed) will change by an amount different from that of the hedging derivative (which typically does not contain a prepayment option), and ineffectiveness will arise.
This effect occurs regardless of whether interest rates increase or decrease—ie regardless of whether re-estimates of prepayments result in the amount in a time period being more or less.
Often the biggest single cause of changes in prepayment rates is changes in interest rates.
Rather, they incorporate the prepayment option by scheduling amounts based on expected maturities.
However, using a layer approach, this difference would not be recognised—if both portfolios were hedged to the same extent, both would be recognised in the balance sheet at the same amount.
In particular, the Board concluded that the hedged item should be designated in such a way that if the entity changes its estimates of the repricing time periods in which items are expected to repay or mature (eg in the light of recent prepayment experience), ineffectiveness arises.
It also concluded that ineffectiveness should arise both when estimated prepayments decrease, resulting in more assets in a particular repricing time period, and when they increase, resulting in fewer.
The Board also considered comments on the Exposure Draft that
In considering these arguments, the Board noted that the percentage approach described in paragraph AG126(b) is a proxy for measuring the change in the fair value of the entire asset (or liability)—including any embedded prepayment option—that is attributable to changes in interest rates.
The Board had developed this proxy in the Exposure Draft because it had been informed that most entities (a) do not separate interest rate risk and prepayment risk for risk management purposes and hence (b) were unable to value the change in the value of the entire asset (including any embedded prepayment option) that is attributable to changes in the hedged interest rates.
However, the comments described in paragraph BC203 indicated that in some cases, entities may be able to measure this change in value directly.
The Board noted that such a direct method of measurement is conceptually preferable to the proxy described in paragraph AG126(b) and, accordingly, decided to recognise it explicitly.
Thus, for example, if an entity that hedges prepayable assets using a combination of interest rate swaps and swaptions is able to measure directly the change in fair value of the entire asset, it could measure effectiveness by comparing the change in the value of the swaps and swaptions with the change in the fair value of the entire asset (including the change in the value of the prepayment option embedded in them) that is attributable to changes in the hedged interest rate.
However, the Board also decided to permit the proxy proposed in the Exposure Draft for those entities that are unable to measure directly the change in the fair value of the entire asset.
Finally, the Board was informed that, to be practicable in terms of systems needs, any approach should not require tracking of the amount in a repricing time period for multiple periods.
Therefore it decided that ineffectiveness should be calculated by determining the change in the estimated amount in a repricing time period between one date on which effectiveness is measured and the next, as described more fully in paragraphs AG126 and AG127.
The Board also noted that the amount of tracking required by the percentage approach is no more than what would be required by any of the layer approaches.
Thus, the Board concluded that none of the approaches was clearly preferable from the standpoint of systems needs.
The carrying amount of the hedged item
The Board considered dealing with this concern by permitting the change in value to be presented in a single line item in the balance sheet.
However, the Board noted that this could result in a decrease in the fair value of a financial asset (financial liability) being recognised as a financial liability (financial asset).
Furthermore, for some repricing time periods the hedged item may be an asset, whereas for others it may be a liability.
The Board concluded that it would be incorrect to present together the changes in fair value for such repricing time periods, because to do so would combine changes in the fair value of assets with changes in the fair value of liabilities.
for those repricing time periods for which the hedged item is an asset, the change in its fair value is presented in a single separate line item within assets; and
for those repricing time periods for which the hedged item is a liability, the change in its fair value is presented in a single separate line item within liabilities.
The Board noted that these line items represent changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
For this reason, the Board decided that they should be presented next to financial assets or financial liabilities.
Derecognition of amounts included in the separate line items
Derecognition of an asset (or liability) in the hedged portfolio
The Board discussed how and when amounts recognised in the separate balance sheet line items should be removed from the balance sheet.
The Board noted that the objective is to remove such amounts from the balance sheet in the same periods as they would have been removed had individual assets or liabilities (rather than an amount) been designated as the hedged item.
The Board noted that this objective could be fully met only if the entity schedules individual assets or liabilities into repricing time periods and tracks both for how long the scheduled individual items have been hedged and how much of each item was hedged in each time period.
In the absence of such scheduling and tracking, some assumptions would need to be made about these matters and, hence, about how much should be removed from the separate balance sheet line items when an asset (or liability) in the hedged portfolio is derecognised.
In addition, some safeguards would be needed to ensure that amounts included in the separate balance sheet line items are removed from the balance sheet over a reasonable period and do not remain in the balance sheet indefinitely.
With these points in mind, the Board decided to require that
The Board noted that for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, amortisation based on a recalculated effective interest rate could be complex to determine and could demand significant additional systems requirements.
Consequently, the Board decided that in the case of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk (and only in such a hedge), the line item balance may be amortised using a straight-line method when a method based on a recalculated effective interest rate is not practicable.
The Board was asked by commentators to clarify whether the hedging instrument may be a portfolio of derivatives containing offsetting risk positions.
The issue arises because the assets and liabilities in each repricing time period change over time as prepayment expectations change, as items are derecognised and as new items are originated.
Thus the net position, and the amount the entity wishes to designate as the hedged item, also changes over time.
If the hedged item decreases, the hedging instrument needs to be reduced.
However, entities do not normally reduce the hedging instrument by disposing of some of the derivatives contained in it.
Instead, entities adjust the hedging instrument by entering into new derivatives with an offsetting risk profile.
The Board decided to permit the hedging instrument to be a portfolio of derivatives containing offsetting risk positions for both individual and portfolio hedges.
It noted that all of the derivatives concerned are measured at fair value.
Hedge effectiveness for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk
The Board decided that if the entity's risk management strategy is to change the amount of the hedging instrument periodically to reflect changes in the hedged position, that strategy affects the determination of the term of the hedge.
Thus, the entity needs to demonstrate that the hedge is expected to be highly effective only for the period until the amount of the hedging instrument is next adjusted.
This is because the entire hedging instrument is designated (and not only some of its cash flows, for example, those to the time when the hedge is next adjusted).
However, expected effectiveness is assessed by considering the change in the fair value of the entire hedging instrument only for the period until it is next adjusted.
The Board decided that entities could use any method to assess retrospective effectiveness, but noted that the chosen method would form part of the documentation of the hedging relationship made at the inception of the hedge in accordance with paragraph 88(a) and hence could not be decided at the time the retrospective effectiveness test is performed.
Transition to fair value hedge accounting for portfolios of interest rate risk
In finalising the amendments to IAS 39, the Board considered whether to provide additional guidance for entities wishing to apply fair value hedge accounting to a portfolio hedge that had previously been accounted for using cash flow hedge accounting.
The Board noted that such entities could apply paragraph 101(d) to revoke the designation of a cash flow hedge and re-designate a new fair value hedge using the same hedged item and hedging instrument, and decided to clarify this in the Application Guidance.
The Board also considered whether to permit retrospective designation of a portfolio hedge.
The Board noted that this would conflict with the principle in paragraph 88(a) that 'at the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship' and accordingly, decided not to permit retrospective designation.
The IASB noted that through novation to a CCP, a party (Party A) to the original derivative has new contractual rights to cash flows from a (new) derivative with the CCP, and this new contract replaces the original contract with a counterparty (Party B).
The IASB noted that the novation to the CCP would release Party A from the responsibility to make payments to Party B and also would oblige Party A to make payments to the CCP.
BC220F Taking into account the conclusion of the assessment on the derecognition requirements, the IASB considered paragraphs 91(a) and 101(a) of IAS 39, which require an entity to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
The IASB noted that novation to a CCP would require the entity to discontinue hedge accounting because the derivative that was designated as a hedging instrument has been derecognised and consequently the hedging instrument in the existing hedging relationship no longer exists.
The IASB noted that the requirement to discontinue hedge accounting meant that although an entity could designate the new derivative as the hedging instrument in a new hedging relationship, this could result in more hedge ineffectiveness, especially for cash flow hedges, compared to a continuing hedging relationship.
This is because the derivative that would be newly designated as the hedging instrument would be on terms that would be different from a new derivative, ie it was unlikely to be 'at-market' (for example, a non-option derivative such as a swap or forward might have a significant fair value) at the time of the novation.
The IASB also considered the feedback from outreach that involved the members of the International Forum of Accounting Standard Setters (IFASS) and securities regulators and noted that this issue is not limited to a specific jurisdiction because many jurisdictions have introduced, or are expected to mandate, laws or regulations that encourage or require the novation of derivatives to a CCP.
Specifically, the G20 agreed to improve OTC derivatives markets so that all standardised OTC derivatives contracts are cleared through a CCP.
The IASB noted that those draft requirements also would require hedge accounting to be discontinued if the novation to a CCP occurs.
The IASB noted that the reduced comment period was necessary because the amendments should be completed urgently because the new laws or regulations to effect CCP clearing of OTC derivatives would come into force within a short period; the contents of the proposed amendments were short; and there was likely to be a broad consensus on the topic.
For example, in order to enter into a derivative with a CCP it may be necessary to make adjustments to the collateral arrangements.
Such narrow changes that are a direct consequence of or are incidental to the novation were acknowledged in the proposed amendments.
However, this would not include changes to, for example, the maturity of the derivatives, the payment dates, or the contractual cash flows or the basis of their calculation, except for charges that may arise as a consequence of transacting with a CCP.
The IASB tentatively decided that it was not appropriate to mandate specific disclosure in this situation because, from the perspective of a user of financial statements, the hedge accounting would be continuing.
The vast majority of respondents agreed that the proposed amendments are necessary.
However, a few respondents expressed disagreement with the proposal on the basis that they disagreed with the IASB's conclusion that hedge accounting would be required to be discontinued as a result of such novations.
The IASB questioned whether replacement of a contract as a result of unforeseen legislative changes (even if documented) fits the definition of a replacement that is part of a 'documented hedging strategy'.
In particular, they argued that voluntary novation to a CCP should be provided with the same relief as novation required by laws or regulations.
A few respondents further requested that the scope should not be limited to novation to a central counterparty and that novation in other circumstances should also be considered.
The IASB also noted that many jurisdictions would not require the existing stock of outstanding historical derivatives to be moved to CCPs, although this was encouraged by the G20 commitment.
BC220Q The IASB observed, however, that for hedge accounting to continue voluntary novation to a CCP should be associated with laws or regulations that are relevant to central clearing of derivatives.
The IASB noted that while a novation need not be required by laws or regulations for hedge accounting to be allowed to continue, allowing all novations to CCPs to be accommodated was broader than the IASB had intended.
In addition, the IASB agreed that hedge accounting should continue when novations are performed as a consequence of laws or regulations or the introduction of laws of regulations but noted that the mere possibility of laws or regulations being introduced was not a sufficient basis for the continuation of hedge accounting.
The IASB also noted that some jurisdictions are introducing a so-called 'indirect clearing' arrangement in their laws or regulations to effect clearing with a CCP, by which a client of a clearing member of a CCP provides a (indirect) clearing service to its client in the same way as a clearing member of a CCP provides a clearing service to its client.
In addition, the IASB observed that an intragroup novation also can occur in order to access a CCP; for example, if only particular group entities can transact directly with a CCP.
The IASB decided that in these circumstances the novation had occurred in order to effect clearing through a CCP, albeit indirectly.
The IASB thus decided also to include such novations in the scope of the amendments because they are consistent with the objective of the proposed amendments—they enable hedge accounting to continue when novations occur as a consequence of laws or regulations or the introduction of laws or regulations that increase the use of CCPs.
However, the IASB noted that when parties to a hedging instrument enter into novations with different counterparties (for example, with different clearing members), these amendments only apply if each of those parties ultimately effects clearing with the same central counterparty.
The IASB noted that this would have the effect of requiring an analysis of whether the general conditions for continuation of hedge accounting are satisfied in other cases (for example, as was raised by some respondents, in determining the effect of intragroup novations in consolidated financial statements).
The IASB confirmed that additional disclosures are not required.
The IASB noted that even with retrospective application, if an entity had previously discontinued hedge accounting, as a result of a novation, that (pre-novation) hedge accounting relationship could not be reinstated because doing so would be inconsistent with the requirements for hedge accounting (ie hedge accounting cannot be applied retrospectively).
Interest rate benchmarks such as interbank offered rates (IBORs) play an important role in global financial markets.
However, cases of attempted market manipulation of some interest rate benchmarks, together with the post-crisis decline in liquidity in interbank unsecured funding markets, have undermined confidence in the reliability and robustness of some interest rate benchmarks.
Against this background, the G20 asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to undertake a fundamental review of major interest rate benchmarks.
Following the review, the FSB published a report setting out its recommended reforms of some major interest rate benchmarks such as IBORs.
Public authorities in many jurisdictions have since taken steps to implement those recommendations.
In some jurisdictions, there is already clear progress towards the reform of interest rate benchmarks, or the replacement of interest rate benchmarks with alternative, nearly risk-free interest rates that are based, to a greater extent, on transaction data (alternative benchmark rates).
This has in turn led to uncertainty about the long-term viability of some interest rate benchmarks.
The same uncertainty arising from the reform regarding the timing and the amount of future cash flows will likely affect the changes in fair value of hedged items and hedging instruments in a fair value hedge of the interest rate benchmark exposure.
Until decisions are made about what the alternative benchmark rate is, and when and how the reform will occur, including specifying its effects on particular contracts, uncertainties will exist regarding the timing and the amount of future cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument.
In applying these requirements, the uncertainties about the timing and the amount of future cash flows could affect an entity's ability to meet those specific forward-looking hedge accounting requirements in the period when uncertainty is created by the reform.
In some cases, solely due to such uncertainties, entities could be required to discontinue hedge accounting for hedging relationships that would otherwise qualify for hedge accounting.
In some cases, discontinuation of hedge accounting would require an entity to recognise gains or losses in profit or loss.
In the Board's view, discontinuation of hedge accounting solely due to such uncertainties before the reform's economic effects on hedged items and hedging instruments are known would not provide useful information to users of financial statements.
The proposed exceptions applied only to the hedge accounting requirements specified in that Exposure Draft and were not intended to provide relief from all consequences arising from the reform.
Many highlighted the urgency of these issues, especially in some jurisdictions where there is already clear progress towards the reform or replacement of interest rate benchmarks with alternative benchmark rates.
The Board understands that a significant number of IFRS preparers—financial institutions in particular—have made such an accounting policy choice.
These respondents asked the Board to clarify whether the scope of the exceptions was meant to include such hedging relationships.
The Board agreed with respondents that other hedging relationships could be directly affected by the reform when the reform gives rise to uncertainties about the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or of the hedging instrument.
Therefore, the Board confirmed that the exceptions would apply to the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows in these situations.
The Board noted that many derivatives, designated in hedging relationships in which there is no uncertainty about the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows, could be indirectly affected by the reform.
For example, this would be the case when the valuation of the derivatives is affected by general uncertainty in the market caused by the reform.
The Board confirmed that the exceptions do not apply to these hedging relationships, despite the indirect effect the uncertainties arising from the reform could have on the valuation of derivatives.
The scope of the exceptions does not exclude hedging relationships in which interest rate risk is not the only hedged risk.
The Board noted that if an entity designates a forecast transaction as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge, applying paragraph 88(c) of IAS 39, that transaction must be highly probable (highly probable requirement).
This requirement is intended to ensure that changes in the fair value of designated hedging instruments are recognised in other comprehensive income only for those hedged forecast transactions that are highly probable to occur.
This requirement is an important discipline in applying hedge accounting to forecast transactions.
More specifically, applying the exception, if the hedged future cash flows are based on an interest rate benchmark that is subject to the reform, an entity assumes that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered when assessing whether the future cash flows are highly probable.
For example, for a future issuance of a London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-referenced debt instrument, the entity would assume that the LIBOR benchmark rate on which the hedged cash flows are based will not be altered as a result of the reform.
The Board noted that this exception does not necessarily result in an entity determining that the hedged cash flows are highly probable.
In the example described in paragraph BC236, the entity assumed that the interest rate benchmark in the future contract would not be altered as a result of the reform when determining whether that forecast transaction is highly probable.
However, if the entity decides not to issue the debt instrument because of uncertainty arising from the reform or for any other reason, the hedged future cash flows are no longer highly probable (and are no longer expected to occur).
The exception would not permit or require the entity to assume otherwise.
In this case, the entity would conclude that the LIBOR-based cash flows are no longer highly probable (and are no longer expected to occur).
The Board also included an exception for discontinued hedging relationships.
If, however, the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur for other reasons, the entity is required to immediately reclassify to profit or loss any amount remaining in other comprehensive income.
If either of these conditions is not met, paragraphs 91(b) and 101(b) require the entity to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.
Interest rate benchmark reform could affect this assessment for hedging relationships that may extend beyond the timing of the reform.
That is because entities would have to consider possible changes to the fair value or future cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments in determining whether a hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective.
Applying this exception, an entity shall assess whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting as required by IAS 39, based on the assumption that the hedged risk or the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged item or the hedging instrument is based is not altered as a result of the reform.
The exception addresses only the uncertainties arising from the reform.
The Board noted that existing IFRS Standards already provide an adequate basis for measuring ineffectiveness.
Most respondents disagreed with the Board's decision not to propose an exception to the retrospective assessment.
Respondents noted that due to the inherent interaction between the assessment of the forward-looking cash flows of the hedged item and its effect on both prospective and retrospective assessments, the proposed amendments would not achieve their intended effect unless an exception is also provided for the retrospective assessment.
In its redeliberations on the amendments to IAS 39, the Board considered the feedback received.
Applying this approach would require entities to separate the assessment of retrospective effectiveness from the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness.
The Board therefore rejected this approach.
The Board acknowledged that such an approach might provide less discipline compared to the approach described in paragraph BC248, which would introduce additional requirements to mitigate the risk of continuing hedge accounting for hedging relationships that failed the retrospective assessment for reasons other than the reform.
The Board noted that any exception to the retrospective assessment will apply only to a well-defined population of hedging relationships during the period of uncertainty on the hedged items and hedging instruments arising from the reform.
Furthermore, the Board noted that the risk of allowing hedge accounting to be applied for hedging relationships that would not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting is mitigated by the required prospective assessment as only the uncertainty arising from the reform is excluded from that assessment.
Any other sources of ineffectiveness would continue to be included in the assessment of whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective in future periods.
The Board noted that any high level of ineffectiveness arising in a hedging relationship is expected to be captured by the prospective assessment.
The Board also noted that all ineffectiveness would be recognised and measured and thus be transparent in financial reporting.
The Board noted that the exceptions were not intended to change the requirement that entities measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness.
The Board considered that the actual results of the hedging relationships would provide useful information to users of financial statements during the period of uncertainty arising from the reform.
Therefore, the Board decided that entities should continue to measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness as required by IFRS Standards.
The Board also considered whether any exceptions should be made to the measurement of hedged items or hedging instruments because of the uncertainty arising from the reform.
However, the Board noted that such an exception would be inconsistent with the decision not to change the requirements to measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness in the financial statements.
Therefore, the Board decided not to provide an exception from the measurement of hedging instruments and hedged items.
In doing so, the entity uses the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the hedged item for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk.
This would include a risk premium for uncertainty inherent in the hedged risk that market participants would consider.
For example, to measure changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk such as the IBOR component of a fixed-rate loan, an entity needs to reflect the uncertainty caused by the reform.
When applying a present value technique to calculate the changes in fair value attributable to the designated risk component, such measurement should reflect market participants' assumptions about the uncertainty arising from the reform.
As the Board decided that entities should continue to measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness as required by IFRS Standards, entities should continue to apply assumptions that are consistent with those applied to the hedged risk of the hedged item.
The hedging gain or loss on the hedged item should be measured using the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows (that is, the cash flows on which the hypothetical derivative is based) when applying a present value technique, discounted at a market-based discount rate that reflects market participants' assumptions about the uncertainty arising from the reform.
The Board concluded that reflecting market participants' assumptions when measuring hedge ineffectiveness provides useful information to users of financial statements about the effects of the uncertainty arising from the reform on an entity's hedging relationships.
Therefore, the Board decided that no exceptions are needed for the measurement of actual ineffectiveness.
For example, if the outcome of the reform affects the market structure of an interest rate benchmark, it could affect an entity's assessment of whether a non-contractually specified LIBOR portion is separately identifiable and, therefore, an eligible hedged item in a hedging relationship.
The Board considered only those designated portions that are implicit in the fair value or the cash flows of an item of which they are a part (referred to as non-contractually specified) because the same issue does not arise for designated portions that are explicitly specified in the contract.
The Board proposed not to extend the relief to allow entities to designate the benchmark portion of interest rate risk as the hedged item in a new hedging relationship if the designated portion is not separately identifiable at the inception of the hedging relationship.
In the Board's view, allowing hedge accounting for designated portions that are not separately identifiable at the inception would be inconsistent with the objective of the exception.
The Board noted that such circumstances are different from allowing continued designation as the hedged item for designated portions that had met the requirement at the inception of the hedging relationship.
Furthermore, the Board did not propose any exception from the requirement that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the designated portion must be reliably measurable.
However, some respondents noted that the proposed exception did not provide equivalent relief to hedging relationships that frequently reset (ie discontinue and restart).
In those hedging relationships both the hedging instrument and the hedged item frequently change (ie the entity uses a dynamic process in which both the hedged items and the hedging instruments used to manage that exposure do not remain the same for long).
As hedging instruments and hedged items are being added or removed from a portfolio, entities are de-designating and redesignating hedging relationships regularly to adjust the exposure.
For the same reasons as those noted in paragraph BC258, this could affect an entity's ability to conclude that a non-contractually specified risk component remains separately identifiable and, therefore, an eligible hedged item for hedge accounting purposes.
Thus, the Board confirmed the proposal that a designated portion is only required to be separately identifiable at the inception of the hedging relationship.
Applying that paragraph, an entity shall determine whether the designated portion is separately identifiable only when it initially designates an item as a hedged item in the hedging relationship.
The hedged item is not reassessed at any subsequent redesignation in the same hedging relationship.
At the inception of the relationship, the entity assesses whether LIBOR is a separately identifiable designated portion for all loans designated within the hedging relationship.
The Board considered but rejected alternatives that would have allowed entities to apply the exceptions voluntarily.
In the Board's view, voluntary application of these exceptions could give rise to selective discontinuation of hedge accounting and selective reclassification of the amounts recorded in other comprehensive income related to previously discontinued hedging relationships.
The Board does not expect that requiring entities to apply the exceptions would entail significant cost for preparers and other affected parties because the exceptions require entities to assume that the interest rate benchmark, on which the hedged risk and the hedged cash flows and cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, is not altered as a result of the reform.
For example, for a particular interest rate benchmark not subject to the reform or replacement with an alternative benchmark rate, there is no uncertainty affecting the timing or the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows arising from a hedged item or a hedging instrument.
Furthermore, for a particular hedging relationship the exceptions may be applicable to some but not all aspects of the hedging relationship.
Similarly, the exception applicable to non-contractually specified designated portions would not be relevant for hedging relationships that do not involve the designation of non-contractually specified portions.
The Board considered whether to provide an explicit end date for the exceptions but decided not to do so.
The reform is following different timelines in different markets and jurisdictions and contracts are being modified at different times and, therefore, at this stage, it is not possible to define a period of applicability for the exceptions.
In the Board's view, for uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount of cash flows arising from a change in an interest rate benchmark to be eliminated, the underlying contracts are generally required to be amended to specify the timing and the amount of cash flows based on the alternative benchmark rate (and any spread adjustment between the interest rate benchmark and the alternative benchmark rate).
The Board noted that, in some cases, a contract may be amended to include reference to the alternative benchmark rate without actually altering the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows in the contract.
Such an amendment may not eliminate the uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows in the contract.
The Board considered the following scenarios to assess the robustness of the end of application requirements.
However, these scenarios are not exhaustive and other scenarios may exist in which the uncertainties arising from the reform regarding the timing and the amount of cash flows would no longer be present.
Scenario A—a contract is amended to include a clause that specifies (a) the date the interest rate benchmark will be replaced by an alternative benchmark rate and (b) the alternative benchmark rate on which the cash flows will be based and the relevant spread adjustment between the interest rate benchmark and the alternative benchmark rate.
In this case, the uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount of cash flows for this contract is eliminated when the contract is amended to include this clause.
In this case, the uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount of cash flows for this contract has not been eliminated by amending the contract to include this clause.
But the clause does not specify those conditions.
In this case, the uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows for this contract has not been eliminated by including this clause in the contract.
Uncertainty regarding both the timing and the amount of cash flows for this contract will be present until the central authority specifies when the replacement of the benchmark will become effective and what the alternative benchmark rate and any related spread adjustment will be.
However, the amendment does not specify the alternative benchmark rate or the spread adjustment between the interest rate benchmark and the alternative benchmark rate on which the cash flows will be based.
In this scenario, by amending the contract to include this clause, uncertainty regarding the timing has been eliminated but uncertainty about the amount remains.
In this scenario, by amending the contract to include this clause, uncertainty about the amount has been eliminated but uncertainty with respect to timing remains.
The objective of the reform is to cease the publication of the current interest rate benchmark and replace it with an alternative benchmark rate.
As part of the reform, the administrator introduces an interim benchmark rate and determines a fixed spread adjustment based on the difference between the interim benchmark rate and the current interest rate benchmark.
For reasons similar to those described in paragraph BC269, the Board noted that there could be situations in which the uncertainty for particular elements of a single hedging relationship could end at different times.
For example, assume an entity is required to apply the relevant exceptions to both the hedged item and the hedging instrument.
The Board observed that continuing to apply the exception after the uncertainty was resolved would not faithfully represent the actual characteristics of the elements of the hedging relationship in which the uncertainty arising from the reform is eliminated.
The Board considered whether it should extend the relief provided such that the exceptions would apply at the hedging relationship level for as long as any element of that hedging relationship was affected by the uncertainties arising from the reform.
The Board agreed that doing so would be beyond the objective of addressing only those issues directly affected by the uncertainty arising from the reform.
Therefore, applying each exception at the hedging relationship level would be inconsistent with how the underlying requirements are applied.
The Board decided that the end of application requirement would also apply to hedges of a forecast transaction.
For example, if an entity designates a future issuance of a LIBOR-based debt instrument as the hedged item, although there may be no contract at the time of designation, the hedge documentation would refer specifically to LIBOR.
Consequently, the Board concluded that entities should be able to identify when the uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount of the resulting cash flows of a forecast transaction is no longer present.
If the Board included an end date for these exceptions, an entity may be required to immediately discontinue hedge accounting because, at some point, as the reform progresses, the designated portion based on the interest rate benchmark may no longer be separately identifiable (for example, as the market for the alternative benchmark rate is established).
Such immediate discontinuation of hedge accounting would be inconsistent with the objective of the exception.
The Board noted that linking the end of application for these exceptions to contract amendments would not achieve the Board's intention either because, by definition, non-contractually specified designated portions are not explicitly stated in a contract and, therefore, these contracts may not be amended for the reform.
This is particularly relevant for fair value hedges of a fixed-rate debt instrument.
The Board decided that the amendments apply retrospectively.
If an entity had not designated a hedging relationship, the exceptions, even though applied retrospectively, would not allow the entity to apply hedge accounting in prior periods to items that were not designated for hedge accounting.
Doing so would be inconsistent with the requirement that hedge accounting applies prospectively.
The Board observed that for information about the effects of the transition to alternative benchmark rates to be useful, the information has to be relevant to users of financial statements and faithfully represent the economic effects of that transition on the entity.
This objective assisted the Board in assessing whether it should amend IFRS Standards or whether the requirements in IFRS Standards already provided an adequate basis to account for such effects.
The Board observed that amending the formal designation of a hedging relationship to reflect the changes required by the reform would result in the discontinuation of the hedging relationship.
designating the alternative benchmark rate (contractually or non-contractually specified) as a hedged risk;
amending the description of how the entity will assess hedge effectiveness.
However, notwithstanding their general agreement with the proposed amendments, some respondents asked the Board to clarify the scope and timing of the required changes to the affected hedging relationships.
Regarding the scope of the required changes to the affected hedging relationships, the Board acknowledged it may be necessary to amend the designated hedged portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged when the hedging relationship is amended to reflect the changes required by the reform.
In considering the timing of when entities are required to amend an affected hedging relationship, the Board sought to balance the operational effort needed to amend the hedging relationships with maintaining the required discipline in the amendments to hedging relationships.
Specifically, it sought to address the challenges associated with specifying the timing of when entities have to amend hedging relationships as required in paragraph 102P of IAS 39—particularly in the context of the large volume of changes that entities may need to make in a relatively short time—while also ensuring that the amendments to hedging relationships are accounted for in the applicable reporting period.
As set out in paragraph BC5.318 of the Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 9, the Board considered that changes might be made to a financial asset or a financial liability, or to the formal designation of a hedging relationship, in addition to those changes required by the reform.
Replacement of hedging instruments in hedging relationships
The Board confirmed that, consistent with the rationale in paragraph BC5.298 of the Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 9, it is the substance of an arrangement, rather than its form, that determines the appropriate accounting treatment.
In this context, the Board noted that if these other approaches result in derivatives with substantially different terms from those of the original derivative, the change may not have been made on an economically equivalent basis.
The Board also noted that if a hedging instrument is derecognised, hedge accounting is required to be discontinued.
Therefore, the Board decided that for hedge accounting to continue it is also necessary that the original hedging instrument would not be derecognised.
The Board considered these approaches described by respondents
Under this approach the counterparty to the new derivatives is the same as to the original derivative, the original derivative has not been derecognised and the terms of the alternative benchmark rate derivative are not substantially different from that of the original derivative.
The Board disagreed with this view because the original derivative is extinguished and replaced with an alternative benchmark rate derivative with substantially different contractual terms.
The Board noted that, in principle, the combination of an interest rate benchmark-based derivative and an interest rate benchmark-alternative benchmark rate swap could achieve an outcome economically equivalent to amending the original interest rate benchmark-based derivative.
However, the Board observed that, in practice, basis swaps are generally entered into on an aggregated basis to economically hedge an entity's net exposure to basis risk, rather than on an individual derivative basis.
The Board therefore noted that for this approach to be consistent with the changes required by the reform as described in paragraph 102P of IAS 39, the basis swap must be coupled or linked with the original derivative, ie done on an individual derivative basis.
the original hedging instrument is not derecognised; and
Remeasurement of the hedged item and hedging instrument
The Board concluded that the most useful information would be provided to users of financial statements if requirements for recognition and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness remain unchanged (see paragraph BC253).
Applying the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39, a gain or loss arising from the remeasurement of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk or from remeasuring the hedging instrument is reflected in profit or loss when measuring and recognising hedge ineffectiveness.
The Board considered whether to provide an exception from the requirement to include in hedge ineffectiveness such fair value changes when they arise.
The Board considered, but rejected, these approaches
The Board rejected this approach because it would require an offsetting entry to be recognised either in the statement of financial position or as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item or hedging instrument.
However, the Board rejected this approach because the changes to the hedged risk might be driven by amendments to hedging relationships that may occur in different reporting periods.
Therefore, recognising adjustments to retained earnings over time would be inconsistent with the Board's previous decisions (throughout IFRS Standards) that an adjustment to retained earnings only applies on transition to new requirements in IFRS Standards.
Furthermore, the Board noted that the measurement adjustment would meet the definition of income or expense in the Conceptual Framework and therefore should be recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
The Board also noted that recognising measurement adjustments directly in retained earnings would be inconsistent with the decision that no exceptions should be made to the measurement of hedged items or hedging instruments.
The Board acknowledged these comments noting that, applying paragraph 102P of IAS 39, a significant change in fair value arising from the remeasurement of the hedged item or the hedging instrument indicates that the changes were not made on an economically equivalent basis.
The Board considered that accounting for such fair value changes in any other way would be inconsistent with the decision to continue applying hedge accounting for such amended hedging relationships (see paragraph 102P of IAS 39).
Accounting for qualifying hedging relationships
Specifically, it would be inconsistent with the objective of the exception to prevent the discontinuation of hedge accounting solely due to the effects of the uncertainties arising from the reform on the actual results of a hedge while recognising all ineffectiveness in the financial statements.
As required by IAS 39, the entity would continue to measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness by comparing the actual gains or losses on the hedged item to those on the hedging instrument.
For example, this could be the case when there is market volatility during the initial period following the transition to an alternative benchmark rate.
Considering the nature of this amendment, the Board decided this election is made on an individual hedging relationship basis.
As noted in paragraph 102L of IAS 39, this exception ceases to apply to the hedged item and the hedging instrument, respectively, at the earlier of, when there is no longer uncertainty about the hedged risk or the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows; and when the hedging relationship that the hedged item and the hedging instrument are a part of is discontinued.
Amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve
The Board considered that uncertainty about the timing and the amount of the hedged cash flows would no longer be present when the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is altered as required by the reform.
Thereafter, applying the requirement in paragraph 88(c) of IAS 39, the assessment of whether the hedged cash flows are still highly probable to occur would be based on the contractual cash flows determined by reference to the alternative benchmark rate.
Therefore, if an entity uses a hypothetical derivative—that is, a derivative that would have terms matching the critical terms of the designated cash flows and the hedged risk, commonly used in cash flow hedges to represent the forecast transaction—the entity may need to change the hypothetical derivative to calculate the change in the value of the hedged item to measure hedge ineffectiveness.
Consequently, as hedge accounting would not be discontinued when a hedging relationship is amended for changes required by the reform (see paragraph 102P of IAS 39), the Board decided that an entity would deem the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve at that point to be based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows are determined.
The approach described in paragraph BC330 is consistent with the Board's view that, when a hedging relationship is amended for changes required by the reform, more useful information is provided to users of financial statements if hedge accounting is not discontinued and amounts are not reclassified to profit or loss solely due to the changes required by the reform.
The Board observed that although a hedging relationship may have been discontinued, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve arising from that hedging relationship remains in the reserve if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur.
The Board noted that if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur, the previously designated hedged item will be subject to a change required by the reform, even if the hedging relationship has been discontinued.
The Board therefore considered that the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is not remeasured as if it had been based on the alternative benchmark rate since inception of the hedging relationship.
The general reference to cash flow hedges in these paragraphs reflects such scope, therefore, the Board considered that explicitly addressing open or closed hedged portfolios was unnecessary.
The Board considered that for groups of items designated as hedged items in a fair value or cash flow hedge, the hedged items could consist of items still referenced to the interest rate benchmark as well as items already referenced to the alternative benchmark rate.
Therefore, an entity could not amend the description of the hedged risk or the hedged item, including the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged with reference only to an alternative benchmark rate for the whole group.
In the Board's view, the same requirements and relief that apply to other hedging relationships should apply to groups of items designated as hedged items, including dynamic hedging relationships.
The Board concluded this accounting outcome is appropriate because the basis for designating the hedged item on a group basis is that the entity is managing the designated hedge for the group as a whole.
Therefore, the Board concluded that the benefits of avoiding the discontinuation of hedge accounting and the resulting accounting impacts outweigh the associated costs of this exception.
Therefore, the Board observed that new items designated as part of the group to replace interest rate benchmark-based items that have matured would be allocated to the relevant subgroup based on the benchmark rate being hedged.
The hypothetical derivative cannot include features in the value of the hedged item that exist only in the hedging instrument (but not in the hedged item).
Designating financial items as hedged items
An entity may designate an item in its entirety or a portion of an item as the hedged item in a hedging relationship.
The Board considered that including an end date for that exception could require an entity to immediately discontinue hedge accounting at a point in time because, as the reform progresses, a risk portion based on the interest rate benchmark may no longer be separately identifiable (for example, as the market for the alternative benchmark rate is established).
when the hedging relationship in which the non-contractually specified risk portion was designated is discontinued.
on a hedge-by-hedge basis—that is, to each hedging relationship individually, beginning from the date an alternative benchmark rate is designated as a risk portion in that relationship; or
However, in the Board's view, a clearly defined end point is necessary because of the temporary nature of the amendment.
However, the Board acknowledged the diversity in the approaches to the reform or replacement of interest rate benchmarks and the timing of the expected completion across various jurisdictions.
The Board emphasised that the amendments apply only for the separately identifiable requirement and not the reliably measurable requirement.
Therefore, if the risk portion is not reliably measurable, either when it is designated or thereafter, the alternative benchmark rate would not meet the qualifying criteria to be designated as a risk portion in a hedging relationship.
The Board decided that providing relief only for the separately identifiable requirement would achieve the objective described in paragraph BC292.
The Board also noted that the amendments are, to a large extent, interlinked and need to be applied consistently.
The Board also does not expect that mandatory application of these amendments would result in significant additional costs for preparers and other affected parties because these amendments are designed to ease the operational burden on preparers, while providing useful information to users of financial statements, and would not require significantly more effort by preparers in addition to what is already required to implement the changes required by the reform.
As noted in paragraph 102R of IAS 39, the Board considered that an entity may be required to amend the formal designation of its hedging relationships at different times, or to amend the formal designation of a hedging relationship more than once.
Thus, an entity could not apply this amendment in other circumstances in which the entity is not able to conclude that an alternative benchmark rate is a separately identifiable risk portion.
The Board therefore considered that discontinuation of hedge accounting solely because of amendments an entity made in hedge documentation to reflect appropriately the changes required by the reform, regardless of when those changes occurred, would not provide useful information to users of financial statements.
However, the Board considered that in the specific circumstances of the reform, an entity would typically be able to reinstate a discontinued hedging relationship without the use of hindsight.
However, the Board agreed with respondents' concerns that there could be other circumstances in which it would not be impracticable to reinstate the hedging relationship, but such reinstatement would be challenging or would have limited benefit.
He agrees with the objective of finding a macro hedging solution that would reduce systems demands without undermining the fundamental accounting principles related to derivative instruments and hedging activities.
Mr Smith believes some decisions made during the Board's deliberations result in an approach to hedge accounting for a portfolio hedge that does not capture what was originally intended, namely a result that is substantially equivalent to designating an individual asset or liability as the hedged item.
Mr Smith believes that the Amendments already go beyond their intended objective.
In particular, he believes that features of these Amendments can be applied to smooth out ineffectiveness and achieve results substantially equivalent to the other methods of measuring ineffectiveness that the Board considered when developing the Exposure Draft.
The Board rejected those methods because they did not require the immediate recognition of all ineffectiveness. He also believes those features could be used to manage earnings.
Subject to the same materiality considerations that apply in this context as throughout IFRSs.
For this purpose, a clearing counterparty is a central counterparty or an entity or entities, for example, a clearing member of a clearing organisation or a client of a clearing member of a clearing organisation, that are acting as counterparty in order to effect clearing by a central counterparty.
In this scenario, the entity would first consider the accounting consequences of amending the contractual terms of the hedging instrument.
The Board will consider the accounting consequences of the actual amendment of financial instruments as a result of interest rate benchmark reform in the next phase of this project (ie the replacement phase).
Information about profit or loss, assets and liabilities
Information about products and services
the separate or individual financial statements of an entity
whose debt or equity instruments are traded in a public market (a domestic or foreign stock exchange or an over-the-counter market, including local and regional markets), or
the consolidated financial statements of a group with a parent
that files, or is in the process of filing, the consolidated financial statements with a securities commission or other regulatory organisation for the purpose of issuing any class of instruments in a public market.
that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity)
for which discrete financial information is available.
For example, a corporate headquarters or some functional departments may not earn revenues or may earn revenues that are only incidental to the activities of the entity and would not be operating segments.
For the purposes of this IFRS, an entity's post-employment benefit plans are not operating segments.
That function is to allocate resources to and assess the performance of the operating segments of an entity.
Often the chief operating decision maker of an entity is its chief executive officer or chief operating officer but, for example, it may be a group of executive directors or others.
However, an entity may produce reports in which its business activities are presented in a variety of ways.
The term 'segment manager' identifies a function, not necessarily a manager with a specific title.
The chief operating decision maker also may be the segment manager for some operating segments.
That structure is sometimes referred to as a matrix form of organisation.
For example, in some entities, some managers are responsible for different product and service lines worldwide, whereas other managers are responsible for specific geographical areas.
The chief operating decision maker regularly reviews the operating results of both sets of components, and financial information is available for both.
In that situation, the entity shall determine which set of components constitutes the operating segments by reference to the core principle.
the nature of the products and services;
the nature of the production processes;
the type or class of customer for their products and services;
if applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment, for example, banking, insurance or public utilities.
Operating segments that do not meet any of the quantitative thresholds may be considered reportable, and separately disclosed, if management believes that information about the segment would be useful to users of the financial statements.
The sources of the revenue included in the 'all other segments' category shall be described.
Reconciliations of the amounts in the statement of financial position for reportable segments to the amounts in the entity's statement of financial position are required for each date at which a statement of financial position is presented.
factors used to identify the entity's reportable segments, including the basis of organisation (for example, whether management has chosen to organise the entity around differences in products and services, geographical areas, regulatory environments, or a combination of factors and whether operating segments have been aggregated);
types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues.
An entity shall report a measure of total assets and liabilities for each reportable segment if such amounts are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.
An entity shall also disclose the following about each reportable segment if the specified amounts are included in the measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, or are otherwise regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker even if not included in that measure of segment profit or loss
revenues from transactions with other operating segments of the same entity;
the entity's interest in the profit or loss of associates and joint ventures accounted for by the equity method;
material non-cash items other than depreciation and amortisation.
An entity shall report interest revenue separately from interest expense for each reportable segment unless a majority of the segment's revenues are from interest and the chief operating decision maker relies primarily on net interest revenue to assess the performance of the segment and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment.
In that situation, an entity may report that segment's interest revenue net of its interest expense and disclose that it has done so.
Adjustments and eliminations made in preparing an entity's financial statements and allocations of revenues, expenses, and gains or losses shall be included in determining reported segment profit or loss only if they are included in the measure of the segment's profit or loss that is used by the chief operating decision maker.
Similarly, only those assets and liabilities that are included in the measures of the segment's assets and segment's liabilities that are used by the chief operating decision maker shall be reported for that segment.
If amounts are allocated to reported segment profit or loss, assets or liabilities, those amounts shall be allocated on a reasonable basis.
At a minimum, an entity shall disclose the following
the basis of accounting for any transactions between reportable segments.
the nature of any differences between the measurements of the reportable segments' profits or losses and the entity's profit or loss before income tax expense or income and discontinued operations (if not apparent from the reconciliations described in paragraph 28).
Those differences could include accounting policies and policies for allocation of centrally incurred costs that are necessary for an understanding of the reported segment information.
the nature of any differences between the measurements of the reportable segments' assets and the entity's assets (if not apparent from the reconciliations described in paragraph 28).
Those differences could include accounting policies and policies for allocation of jointly used assets that are necessary for an understanding of the reported segment information.
the nature of any differences between the measurements of the reportable segments' liabilities and the entity's liabilities (if not apparent from the reconciliations described in paragraph 28).
Those differences could include accounting policies and policies for allocation of jointly utilised liabilities that are necessary for an understanding of the reported segment information.
the nature of any changes from prior periods in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss and the effect, if any, of those changes on the measure of segment profit or loss.
the nature and effect of any asymmetrical allocations to reportable segments.
For example, an entity might allocate depreciation expense to a segment without allocating the related depreciable assets to that segment.
the total of the reportable segments' revenues to the entity's revenue.
the total of the reportable segments' measures of profit or loss to the entity's profit or loss before tax expense (tax income) and discontinued operations.
However, if an entity allocates to reportable segments items such as tax expense (tax income), the entity may reconcile the total of the segments' measures of profit or loss to the entity's profit or loss after those items.
the total of the reportable segments' amounts for every other material item of information disclosed to the corresponding amount for the entity.
All material reconciling items shall be separately identified and described.
For example, the amount of each material adjustment needed to reconcile reportable segment profit or loss to the entity's profit or loss arising from different accounting policies shall be separately identified and described.
The determination of whether the information is not available and the cost to develop it would be excessive shall be made for each individual item of disclosure.
Following a change in the composition of its reportable segments, an entity shall disclose whether it has restated the corresponding items of segment information for earlier periods.
Some entities' business activities are not organised on the basis of differences in related products and services or differences in geographical areas of operations.
The amounts of revenues reported shall be based on the financial information used to produce the entity's financial statements.
revenues from external customers (i) attributed to the entity's country of domicile and (ii) attributed to all foreign countries in total from which the entity derives revenues.
If revenues from external customers attributed to an individual foreign country are material, those revenues shall be disclosed separately.
An entity shall disclose the basis for attributing revenues from external customers to individual countries.
If assets in an individual foreign country are material, those assets shall be disclosed separately.
The amounts reported shall be based on the financial information that is used to produce the entity's financial statements.
If the necessary information is not available and the cost to develop it would be excessive, that fact shall be disclosed.
An entity may provide, in addition to the information required by this paragraph, subtotals of geographical information about groups of countries.
The entity need not disclose the identity of a major customer or the amount of revenues that each segment reports from that customer.
For the purposes of this IFRS, a group of entities known to a reporting entity to be under common control shall be considered a single customer.
However, judgement is required to assess whether a government (including government agencies and similar bodies whether local, national or international) and entities known to the reporting entity to be under the control of that government are considered a single customer.
In assessing this, the reporting entity shall consider the extent of economic integration between those entities.
This appendix is an integral part of the IFRS.
An operating segment is a component of an entity
(a) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity)
(c) for which discrete financial information is available.

The Standard requires an entity to recognise
a liability when an employee has provided service in exchange for employee benefits to be paid in the future; and
an expense when the entity consumes the economic benefit arising from service provided by an employee in exchange for employee benefits.
under formal plans or other formal agreements between an entity and individual employees, groups of employees or their representatives;
under legislative requirements, or through industry arrangements, whereby entities are required to contribute to national, state, industry or other multi-employer plans; or
by those informal practices that give rise to a constructive obligation.
Informal practices give rise to a constructive obligation where the entity has no realistic alternative but to pay employee benefits.
(iv) non-monetary benefits (such as medical care, housing, cars and free or subsidised goods or services) for current employees;
post-employment benefits, such as the following
other post-employment benefits, such as post-employment life insurance and post-employment medical care;
other long-term employee benefits, such as the following
long-term paid absences such as long-service leave or sabbatical leave;
jubilee or other long-service benefits; and
For the purpose of this Standard, employees include directors and other management personnel.
Employee benefits are all forms of consideration given by an entity in exchange for service rendered by employees or for the termination of employment.
Post-employment benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefits and short-term employee benefits) that are payable after the completion of employment.
Other long-term employee benefits are all employee benefits other than short-term employee benefits, post-employment benefits and termination benefits.
Termination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of an employee's employment as a result of either
an entity's decision to terminate an employee's employment before the normal retirement date; or
an employee's decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment.
Definitions relating to classification of plans
Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans.
Multi-employer plans are defined contribution plans (other than state plans) or defined benefit plans (other than state plans) that
pool the assets contributed by various entities that are not under common control; and
Definitions relating to the net defined benefit liability (asset)
The net defined benefit liability (asset) is the deficit or surplus, adjusted for any effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling.
The deficit or surplus is
the fair value of plan assets (if any).
The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The present value of a defined benefit obligation is the present value, without deducting any plan assets, of expected future payments required to settle the obligation resulting from employee service in the current and prior periods.
assets held by a long-term employee benefit fund; and
are held by an entity (a fund) that is legally separate from the reporting entity and exists solely to pay or fund employee benefits; and
are available to be used only to pay or fund employee benefits, are not available to the reporting entity's own creditors (even in bankruptcy), and cannot be returned to the reporting entity, unless either
the remaining assets of the fund are sufficient to meet all the related employee benefit obligations of the plan or the reporting entity; or
the assets are returned to the reporting entity to reimburse it for employee benefits already paid.
can be used only to pay or fund employee benefits under a defined benefit plan; and
are not available to the reporting entity's own creditors (even in bankruptcy) and cannot be paid to the reporting entity, unless either
the proceeds represent surplus assets that are not needed for the policy to meet all the related employee benefit obligations; or
the proceeds are returned to the reporting entity to reimburse it for employee benefits already paid.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Definitions relating to defined benefit cost
current service cost, which is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current period;
past service cost, which is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods, resulting from a plan amendment (the introduction or withdrawal of, or changes to, a defined benefit plan) or a curtailment (a significant reduction by the entity in the number of employees covered by a plan); and
any gain or loss on settlement.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) is the change during the period in the net defined benefit liability (asset) that arises from the passage of time.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) comprise
the return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset); and
any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset).
Actuarial gains and losses are changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from
experience adjustments (the effects of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred); and
the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.
The return on plan assets is interest, dividends and other income derived from the plan assets, together with realised and unrealised gains or losses on the plan assets, less
any costs of managing plan assets; and
any tax payable by the plan itself, other than tax included in the actuarial assumptions used to measure the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
non-monetary benefits (such as medical care, housing, cars and free or subsidised goods or services) for current employees.
However, if the characteristics of the benefit change (such as a change from a non-accumulating benefit to an accumulating benefit) or if a change in expectations of the timing of settlement is not temporary, then the entity considers whether the benefit still meets the definition of short-term employee benefits.
as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any amount already paid.
If the amount already paid exceeds the undiscounted amount of the benefits, an entity shall recognise that excess as an asset (prepaid expense) to the extent that the prepayment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.
in the case of accumulating paid absences, when the employees render service that increases their entitlement to future paid absences.
in the case of non-accumulating paid absences, when the absences occur.
Accumulating paid absences may be either vesting (in other words, employees are entitled to a cash payment for unused entitlement on leaving the entity) or non-vesting (when employees are not entitled to a cash payment for unused entitlement on leaving).
An obligation arises as employees render service that increases their entitlement to future paid absences.
In many cases, an entity may not need to make detailed computations to estimate that there is no material obligation for unused paid absences.
This is commonly the case for sick pay (to the extent that unused past entitlement does not increase future entitlement), maternity or paternity leave and paid absences for jury service or military service.
An entity recognises no liability or expense until the time of the absence, because employee service does not increase the amount of the benefit.
the entity has a present legal or constructive obligation to make such payments as a result of past events; and
a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
A present obligation exists when, and only when, the entity has no realistic alternative but to make the payments.
Such plans create a constructive obligation as employees render service that increases the amount to be paid if they remain in service until the end of the specified period.
The measurement of such constructive obligations reflects the possibility that some employees may leave without receiving profit-sharing payments.
Nevertheless, in some cases, an entity has a practice of paying bonuses.
In such cases, the entity has a constructive obligation because the entity has no realistic alternative but to pay the bonus.
the formal terms of the plan contain a formula for determining the amount of the benefit;
the entity determines the amounts to be paid before the financial statements are authorised for issue; or
Therefore, an entity recognises the cost of profit-sharing and bonus plans not as a distribution of profit but as an expense.
Post-employment benefits: distinction between defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans
other post-employment benefits, such as post-employment life insurance and post-employment medical care.
Arrangements whereby an entity provides post-employment benefits are post-employment benefit plans.
An entity applies this Standard to all such arrangements whether or not they involve the establishment of a separate entity to receive contributions and to pay benefits.
Thus, the amount of the post-employment benefits received by the employee is determined by the amount of contributions paid by an entity (and perhaps also the employee) to a post-employment benefit plan or to an insurance company, together with investment returns arising from the contributions.
In consequence, actuarial risk (that benefits will be less than expected) and investment risk (that assets invested will be insufficient to meet expected benefits) fall, in substance, on the employee.
a plan benefit formula that is not linked solely to the amount of contributions and requires the entity to provide further contributions if assets are insufficient to meet the benefits in the plan benefit formula;
those informal practices that give rise to a constructive obligation.
For example, a constructive obligation may arise where an entity has a history of increasing benefits for former employees to keep pace with inflation even where there is no legal obligation to do so.
the entity's obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former employees; and
actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk fall, in substance, on the entity.
If actuarial or investment experience are worse than expected, the entity's obligation may be increased.
account for its proportionate share of the defined benefit obligation, plan assets and cost associated with the plan in the same way as for any other defined benefit plan; and
the plan is financed on a pay-as-you-go basis: contributions are set at a level that is expected to be sufficient to pay the benefits falling due in the same period; and future benefits earned during the current period will be paid out of future contributions; and
employees' benefits are determined by the length of their service and the participating entities have no realistic means of withdrawing from the plan without paying a contribution for the benefits earned by employees up to the date of withdrawal.
Therefore, such a plan is a defined benefit plan.
However, an entity may not be able to identify its share of the underlying financial position and performance of the plan with sufficient reliability for accounting purposes.
the entity does not have access to sufficient information about the plan to satisfy the requirements of this Standard.
It therefore accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan.
The entity recognises a liability for the contributions adjusted for the time value of money and an equal expense in profit or loss.
A group administration plan is merely an aggregation of single employer plans combined to allow participating employers to pool their assets for investment purposes and reduce investment management and administration costs, but the claims of different employers are segregated for the sole benefit of their own employees.
Group administration plans pose no particular accounting problems because information is readily available to treat them in the same way as any other single employer plan and because such plans do not expose the participating entities to actuarial risks associated with the current and former employees of other entities.
The definitions in this Standard require an entity to classify a group administration plan as a defined contribution plan or a defined benefit plan in accordance with the terms of the plan (including any constructive obligation that goes beyond the formal terms).
If there is a contractual agreement or stated policy for charging to individual group entities the net defined benefit cost for the plan as a whole measured in accordance with this Standard, the entity shall, in its separate or individual financial statements, recognise the net defined benefit cost so charged.
If there is no such agreement or policy, the net defined benefit cost shall be recognised in the separate or individual financial statements of the group entity that is legally the sponsoring employer for the plan.
The other group entities shall, in their separate or individual financial statements, recognise a cost equal to their contribution payable for the period.
Some plans established by an entity provide both compulsory benefits, as a substitute for benefits that would otherwise be covered under a state plan, and additional voluntary benefits.
Such plans are not state plans.
Many state plans are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis: contributions are set at a level that is expected to be sufficient to pay the required benefits falling due in the same period; future benefits earned during the current period will be paid out of future contributions.
For this reason, state plans are normally defined contribution plans.
The entity shall treat such a plan as a defined contribution plan unless the entity will have (either directly, or indirectly through the plan) a legal or constructive obligation either
to pay the employee benefits directly when they fall due; or
to pay further amounts if the insurer does not pay all future employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
If the entity retains such a legal or constructive obligation, the entity shall treat the plan as a defined benefit plan.
Post-employment benefit plans involving insurance policies are subject to the same distinction between accounting and funding as other funded plans.
The payment of fixed premiums under such contracts is, in substance, the settlement of the employee benefit obligation, rather than an investment to meet the obligation.
Consequently, the entity no longer has an asset or a liability.
Therefore, an entity treats such payments as contributions to a defined contribution plan.
Consequently, no actuarial assumptions are required to measure the obligation or the expense and there is no possibility of any actuarial gain or loss.
as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any contribution already paid.
If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for service before the end of the reporting period, an entity shall recognise that excess as an asset (prepaid expense) to the extent that the prepayment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.
Therefore, the entity is, in substance, underwriting the actuarial and investment risks associated with the plan.
Consequently, the expense recognised for a defined benefit plan is not necessarily the amount of the contribution due for the period.
determining amounts to be recognised in profit or loss
For practical reasons, an entity may request a qualified actuary to carry out a detailed valuation of the obligation before the end of the reporting period.
Nevertheless, the results of that valuation are updated for any material transactions and other material changes in circumstances (including changes in market prices and interest rates) up to the end of the reporting period.
Nevertheless, it is usually difficult for an entity to terminate its obligation under a plan (without payment) if employees are to be retained.
Therefore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, accounting for post-employment benefits assumes that an entity that is currently promising such benefits will continue to do so over the remaining working lives of employees.
An entity recognises a net defined benefit asset in such cases because
that control is a result of past events (contributions paid by the entity and service rendered by the employee); and
future economic benefits are available to the entity in the form of a reduction in future contributions or a cash refund, either directly to the entity or indirectly to another plan in deficit.
The asset ceiling is the present value of those future benefits.
The ultimate cost of the plan is uncertain and this uncertainty is likely to persist over a long period of time.
In order to measure the present value of the post-employment benefit obligations and the related current service cost, it is necessary
For simplicity, this example ignores the additional adjustment needed to reflect the probability that the employee may leave the entity at an earlier or later date.
the date when further service by the employee will lead to no material amount of further benefits under the plan, other than from further salary increases.
That obligation arises as employees render services in return for post-employment benefits that an entity expects to pay in future reporting periods.
Actuarial techniques allow an entity to measure that obligation with sufficient reliability to justify recognition of a liability.
If the benefit is payable immediately when the employee leaves the entity, the current service cost and the present value of the defined benefit obligation reflect the date at which the employee is expected to leave.
Thus, because of the effect of discounting, they are less than the amounts that would be determined if the employee left at the end of the reporting period.
The current service cost is the present value of that benefit.
Employee service before the vesting date gives rise to a constructive obligation because, at the end of each successive reporting period, the amount of future service that an employee will have to render before becoming entitled to the benefit is reduced.
In measuring its defined benefit obligation, an entity considers the probability that some employees may not satisfy any vesting requirements.
Similarly, although some post-employment benefits, for example, post-employment medical benefits, become payable only if a specified event occurs when an employee is no longer employed, an obligation is created when the employee renders service that will provide entitlement to the benefit if the specified event occurs.
The probability that the specified event will occur affects the measurement of the obligation, but does not determine whether the obligation exists.
Therefore, all benefit is attributed to periods ending on or before that date.
Benefit is attributed to individual accounting periods under the plan's benefit formula.
That is because the employee's service throughout the entire period will ultimately lead to benefit at that higher level.
The plan provides no further benefit for subsequent service.
Those benefits are conditional on further service.
For all employees, the current service cost and the present value of the obligation reflect the probability that the employee may not complete the necessary period of service.
For these employees, no benefit is attributed to service between the end of the tenth year and the estimated date of leaving.
the amount of benefit attributed to each period is a constant proportion of the salary to which the benefit is linked.
No benefit is attributed to service after that age.
demographic assumptions about the future characteristics of current and former employees (and their dependants) who are eligible for benefits.
Demographic assumptions deal with matters such as
rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement;
(iii) the proportion of plan members with dependants who will be eligible for benefits;
(iv) the proportion of plan members who will select each form of payment option available under the plan terms; and
claim rates under medical plans.
financial assumptions, dealing with items such as
(iv) taxes payable by the plan on contributions relating to service before the reporting date or on benefits resulting from that service.
For example, all assumptions that depend on a particular inflation level (such as assumptions about interest rates and salary and benefit increases) in any given future period assume the same inflation level in that period.
For currencies for which there is no deep market in such high quality corporate bonds, the market yields (at the end of the reporting period) on government bonds denominated in that currency shall be used.
The currency and term of the corporate bonds or government bonds shall be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations.
The discount rate reflects the time value of money but not the actuarial or investment risk.
In practice, an entity often achieves this by applying a single weighted average discount rate that reflects the estimated timing and amount of benefit payments and the currency in which the benefits are to be paid.
In such cases, an entity uses current market rates of the appropriate term to discount shorter-term payments, and estimates the discount rate for longer maturities by extrapolating current market rates along the yield curve.
The total present value of a defined benefit obligation is unlikely to be particularly sensitive to the discount rate applied to the portion of benefits that is payable beyond the final maturity of the available corporate or government bonds.
the benefits set out in the terms of the plan (or resulting from any constructive obligation that goes beyond those terms) at the end of the reporting period;
any estimated future salary increases that affect the benefits payable;
the effect of any limit on the employer's share of the cost of the future benefits;
those changes were enacted before the end of the reporting period; or
historical data, or other reliable evidence, indicate that those state benefits will change in some predictable manner, for example, in line with future changes in general price levels or general salary levels.
This is the case if, for example
the entity has a history of increasing benefits, for example, to mitigate the effects of inflation, and there is no indication that this practice will change in the future;
the entity is obliged, by either the formal terms of a plan (or a constructive obligation that goes beyond those terms) or legislation, to use any surplus in the plan for the benefit of plan participants (see paragraph 108(c)); or
benefits vary in response to a performance target or other criteria.
For example, the terms of the plan may state that it will pay reduced benefits or require additional contributions from employees if the plan assets are insufficient.
The measurement of the obligation reflects the best estimate of the effect of the performance target or other criteria.
Such changes will result in
past service cost, to the extent that they change benefits for service before the change; and
current service cost for periods after the change, to the extent that they change benefits for service after the change.
The ultimate cost of the benefits takes account of the effect of a limit on contributions.
The effect of a limit on contributions is determined over the shorter of
the estimated life of the entity; and
the estimated life of the plan.
Contributions by employees reduce the cost of the benefits to the entity.
An example of contributions that are not linked to service is when the contributions are required to reduce a deficit arising from losses on plan assets or from actuarial losses.
current and past service cost (if those changes are not set out in the formal terms of a plan and do not arise from a constructive obligation); or
actuarial gains and losses (if those changes are set out in the formal terms of a plan, or arise from a constructive obligation).
The measurement of such benefits reflects the best estimate of such variables, based on historical data and other reliable evidence.
An entity estimates future medical costs on the basis of historical data about the entity's own experience, supplemented where necessary by historical data from other entities, insurance companies, medical providers or other sources.
Estimates of future medical costs consider the effect of technological advances, changes in health care utilisation or delivery patterns and changes in the health status of plan participants.
Therefore, historical data are adjusted to the extent that the demographic mix of the population differs from that of the population used as a basis for the data.
They are also adjusted where there is reliable evidence that historical trends will not continue.
the benefits offered under the plan and the plan assets before the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement; and
In some cases, a plan amendment occurs before a settlement, such as when an entity changes the benefits under the plan and settles the amended benefits later.
However, the termination of a plan is not a settlement if the plan is replaced by a new plan that offers benefits that are, in substance, the same.
In doing so, an entity shall not consider the effect of the asset ceiling.
An entity shall then determine the effect of the asset ceiling after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement and shall recognise any change in that effect in accordance with paragraph 57(d).
when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and
A curtailment may arise from an isolated event, such as the closing of a plant, discontinuance of an operation or termination or suspension of a plan.
underestimates and overestimates of discretionary pension increases when an entity has a constructive obligation to grant such increases (there is no past service cost because actuarial assumptions allow for such increases);
the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the entity in connection with the settlement.
The acquisition of such a policy is not a settlement if the entity retains a legal or constructive obligation (see paragraph 46) to pay further amounts if the insurer does not pay the employee benefits specified in the insurance policy.
Plan assets are reduced by any liabilities of the fund that do not relate to employee benefits, for example, trade and other payables and liabilities resulting from derivative financial instruments.
Paragraph 140(b) requires the entity to disclose a brief description of the link between the reimbursement right and the related obligation.
However, the entity may transfer those amounts recognised in other comprehensive income within equity.
the net defined benefit liability (asset) determined in accordance with paragraph 99(b); and
the discount rate used to remeasure the net defined benefit liability (asset) in accordance with paragraph 99(b).
In applying paragraph 123A, the entity shall also take into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period resulting from contributions or benefit payments.
The difference between the interest income on plan assets and the return on plan assets is included in the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (asset).
The difference between interest on the effect of the asset ceiling and the total change in the effect of the asset ceiling is included in the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (asset).
Causes of actuarial gains and losses include, for example
unexpectedly high or low rates of employee turnover, early retirement or mortality or of increases in salaries, benefits (if the formal or constructive terms of a plan provide for inflationary benefit increases) or medical costs;
the effect of changes to assumptions concerning benefit payment options;
the effect of changes in estimates of future employee turnover, early retirement or mortality or of increases in salaries, benefits (if the formal or constructive terms of a plan provide for inflationary benefit increases) or medical costs; and
the effect of changes in the discount rate.
Such changes result in past service cost or gains or losses on settlement.
Other administration costs are not deducted from the return on plan assets.
This Standard does not specify whether an entity should distinguish current and non-current portions of assets and liabilities arising from post-employment benefits.
For example, an entity may present an analysis of the present value of the defined benefit obligation that distinguishes the nature, characteristics and risks of the obligation.
Such a disclosure could distinguish
between amounts owing to active members, deferred members, and pensioners.
between vested benefits and accrued but not vested benefits.
between conditional benefits, amounts attributable to future salary increases and other benefits.
different characteristics such as flat salary pension plans, final salary pension plans or post-employment medical plans.
different funding arrangements (eg wholly unfunded, wholly or partly funded).
information about the characteristics of its defined benefit plans, including
the nature of the benefits provided by the plan (eg final salary defined benefit plan or contribution-based plan with guarantee).
a description of the regulatory framework in which the plan operates, for example the level of any minimum funding requirements, and any effect of the regulatory framework on the plan, such as the asset ceiling (see paragraph 64).
(iii) a description of any other entity's responsibilities for the governance of the plan, for example responsibilities of trustees or of board members of the plan.
a description of the risks to which the plan exposes the entity, focused on any unusual, entity-specific or plan-specific risks, and of any significant concentrations of risk.
a description of any plan amendments, curtailments and settlements.
the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
(iii) the effect of the asset ceiling.
An entity shall also describe the relationship between any reimbursement right and the related obligation.
remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset), showing separately
the return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in interest in (b).
actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in demographic assumptions (see paragraph 76(a)).
(iv) changes in the effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in interest in (b).
An entity shall also disclose how it determined the maximum economic benefit available, ie whether those benefits would be in the form of refunds, reductions in future contributions or a combination of both.
past service cost and gains and losses arising from settlements.
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates.
contributions to the plan, showing separately those by the employer and by plan participants.
payments from the plan, showing separately the amount paid in respect of any settlements.
the effects of business combinations and disposals.
equity instruments (segregated by industry type, company size, geography etc);
debt instruments (segregated by type of issuer, credit quality, geography etc);
real estate (segregated by geography etc);
derivatives (segregated by type of underlying risk in the contract, for example, interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, equity contracts, credit contracts, longevity swaps etc);
investment funds (segregated by type of fund);
Such disclosure shall be in absolute terms (eg as an absolute percentage, and not just as a margin between different percentages and other variables).
When an entity provides disclosures in total for a grouping of plans, it shall provide such disclosures in the form of weighted averages or relatively narrow ranges.
the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses required by (a) and the limitations of those methods.
changes from the previous period in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses, and the reasons for such changes.
a description of any funding arrangements and funding policy that affect future contributions.

This will include the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation and may include other information about the distribution of the timing of benefit payments, such as a maturity analysis of the benefit payments.
a description of the funding arrangements, including the method used to determine the entity's rate of contributions and any minimum funding requirements.
a description of the extent to which the entity can be liable to the plan for other entities' obligations under the terms and conditions of the multi-employer plan.
a description of any agreed allocation of a deficit or surplus on
wind-up of the plan; or
the fact that the plan is a defined benefit plan.
the reason why sufficient information is not available to enable the entity to account for the plan as a defined benefit plan.
(iii) the expected contributions to the plan for the next annual reporting period.
(iv) information about any deficit or surplus in the plan that may affect the amount of future contributions, including the basis used to determine that deficit or surplus and the implications, if any, for the entity.
an indication of the level of participation of the entity in the plan compared with other participating entities.
Examples of measures that might provide such an indication include the entity's proportion of the total contributions to the plan or the entity's proportion of the total number of active members, retired members, and former members entitled to benefits, if that information is available.
the contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost or the fact that there is no such policy.
the policy for determining the contribution to be paid by the entity.
that group entity's financial statements separately identify and disclose the information required about the plan; and
related party transactions with post-employment benefit plans; and
post-employment benefits for key management personnel.
long-term paid absences such as long-service or sabbatical leave;
jubilee or other long-service benefits;
If the level of benefit depends on the length of service, an obligation arises when the service is rendered.
Measurement of that obligation reflects the probability that payment will be required and the length of time for which payment is expected to be made.
Termination benefits result from either an entity's decision to terminate the employment or an employee's decision to accept an entity's offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment.
Some entities provide a lower level of benefit for termination of employment at the request of the employee (in substance, a post-employment benefit) than for termination of employment at the request of the entity.
The difference between the benefit provided for termination of employment at the request of the employee and a higher benefit provided at the request of the entity is a termination benefit.
Termination benefits are typically lump sum payments, but sometimes also include
enhancement of post-employment benefits, either indirectly through an employee benefit plan or directly.
salary until the end of a specified notice period if the employee renders no further service that provides economic benefits to the entity.
the benefit is conditional on future service being provided (including benefits that increase if further service is provided).
the benefit is provided in accordance with the terms of an employee benefit plan.
For example, they may be specified by statute, employment contract or union agreement, or may be implied as a result of the employer's past practice of providing similar benefits.
As another example, if an entity makes an offer of benefits available for more than a short period, or there is more than a short period between the offer and the expected date of actual termination, the entity considers whether it has established a new employee benefit plan and hence whether the benefits offered under that plan are termination benefits or post-employment benefits.
Employee benefits provided in accordance with the terms of an employee benefit plan are termination benefits if they both result from an entity's decision to terminate an employee's employment and are not conditional on future service being provided.
The payment of such benefits is certain (subject to any vesting or minimum service requirements) but the timing of their payment is uncertain.
Although such benefits are described in some jurisdictions as termination indemnities or termination gratuities, they are post-employment benefits rather than termination benefits, and an entity accounts for them as post-employment benefits.
when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and
when the employee accepts the offer; and
when a restriction (eg a legal, regulatory or contractual requirement or other restriction) on the entity's ability to withdraw the offer takes effect.
This would be when the offer is made, if the restriction existed at the time of the offer.
Because the entity needs the expertise of the employees at the factory to complete some contracts, it announces a plan of termination as follows.
This is the amount that an entity would have to pay for terminating the employment regardless of whether the employees stay and render service until closure of the factory or they leave before closure.
Even though the employees can leave before closure, the termination of all employees' employment is a result of the entity's decision to close the factory and terminate their employment (ie all employees will leave employment when the factory closes).
Benefits provided in exchange for service
Any initial adjustment arising from the application of the amendment shall be recognised in retained earnings at the beginning of that period.
If an entity applies these amendments earlier, it shall disclose that fact.
(a) In this Standard monetary amounts are denominated in 'currency units (CU)'.
The IFRS Interpretations Committee received requests for guidance on the accounting for levies in the financial statements of the entity that is paying the levy.
It also addresses the accounting for a liability to pay a levy whose timing and amount is certain.
Entities should apply other Standards to decide whether the recognition of a liability to pay a levy gives rise to an asset or an expense.
fines or other penalties that are imposed for breaches of the legislation.
Government' refers to government, government agencies and similar bodies whether local, national or international.
For example, if the activity that triggers the payment of the levy is the generation of revenue in the current period and the calculation of that levy is based on the revenue that was generated in a previous period, the obligating event for that levy is the generation of revenue in the current period.
The generation of revenue in the previous period is necessary, but not sufficient, to create a present obligation.
For example, if the obligating event is the generation of revenue over a period of time, the corresponding liability is recognised as the entity generates that revenue.
As a result, in the interim financial report, a liability to pay a levy
shall not be recognised if there is no present obligation to pay the levy at the end of the interim reporting period; and
Therefore, in relation to non-monetary items measured at historical cost, the entity's opening statement of financial position at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements shall be restated to reflect the effect of inflation from the date the assets were acquired and the liabilities were incurred or assumed until the end of the reporting period.
However, the deferred tax figures in the opening statement of financial position for the reporting period shall be determined as follows
the deferred tax items remeasured in accordance with (a) are restated for the change in the measuring unit from the date of the opening statement of financial position of the reporting period to the end of that reporting period.
cumulative translation differences (paragraphs D12-D13A);
Instead of applying paragraph D12 or paragraph D13, a subsidiary that uses the exemption in paragraph D16(a) may elect, in its financial statements, to measure cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations at the carrying amount that would be included in the parent's consolidated financial statements, based on the parent's date of transition to IFRSs, if no adjustments were made for consolidation procedures and for the effects of the business combination in which the parent acquired the subsidiary.
A similar election is available to an associate or joint venture that uses the exemption in paragraph D16(a).

The lessee shall apply another systematic basis if that basis is more representative of the pattern of the lessee's benefit.
there is a lease modification; or
there is any change in the lease term (for example, the lessee exercises an option not previously included in its determination of the lease term).
A class of underlying asset is a grouping of underlying assets of a similar nature and use in an entity's operations.
The election for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value can be made on a lease-by-lease basis.
Identifying a lease (paragraphs B9–B33)
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Paragraphs B32–B33 set out guidance on separating components of a contract.
If an observable stand-alone price is not readily available, the lessee shall estimate the stand-alone price, maximising the use of observable information.

periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.
is within the control of the lessee; and
For example, the non-cancellable period of a lease will change if
the lessee exercises an option not previously included in the entity's determination of the lease term;
the lessee does not exercise an option previously included in the entity's determination of the lease term;
an event occurs that contractually obliges the lessee to exercise an option not previously included in the entity's determination of the lease term; or
an event occurs that contractually prohibits the lessee from exercising an option previously included in the entity's determination of the lease term.
Initial measurement of the right-of-use asset
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;
any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and
an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.
The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either at the commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period.
Initial measurement of the lease liability
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments as described in paragraph B42), less any lease incentives receivable;
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date (as described in paragraph 28);
amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;
the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option (assessed considering the factors described in paragraphs B37–B40); and
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.
Subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset
less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and
Subsequent measurement of the lease liability

reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and
interest on the lease liability; and
variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.
Reassessment of the lease liability
A lessee shall recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
A lessee shall determine the revised lease payments to reflect the change in amounts payable under the purchase option.
there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, including for example a change to reflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review.
The lessee shall remeasure the lease liability to reflect those revised lease payments only when there is a change in the cash flows (ie when the adjustment to the lease payments takes effect).
A lessee shall determine the revised lease payments for the remainder of the lease term based on the revised contractual payments.
In that case, the lessee shall use a revised discount rate that reflects changes in the interest rate.
the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.
remeasure the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.
The revised discount rate is determined as the interest rate implicit in the lease for the remainder of the lease term, if that rate can be readily determined, or the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of the modification, if the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined.
making a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset for all other lease modifications.
A lessee that makes this election shall account for any change in lease payments resulting from the rent concession the same way it would account for the change applying this Standard if the change were not a lease modification.
The practical expedient in paragraph 46A applies only to rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence of the covid-19 pandemic and only if all of the following conditions are met
the change in lease payments results in revised consideration for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change;
there is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease.
right-of-use assets separately from other assets.
If a lessee does not present right-of-use assets separately in the statement of financial position, the lessee shall
include right-of-use assets within the same line item as that within which the corresponding underlying assets would be presented if they were owned; and
disclose which line items in the statement of financial position include those right-of-use assets.
lease liabilities separately from other liabilities.

short-term lease payments, payments for leases of low-value assets and variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability within operating activities.
However, a lessee need not duplicate information that is already presented elsewhere in the financial statements, provided that the information is incorporated by cross-reference in the single note or separate section about leases.
depreciation charge for right-of-use assets by class of underlying asset;
interest expense on lease liabilities;
the expense relating to variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities;
income from subleasing right-of-use assets;
total cash outflow for leases;
gains or losses arising from sale and leaseback transactions; and
In that case, a lessee is not required to provide the disclosures in paragraph 53(a), (f), (h) or (j) for those right-of-use assets.
This additional information may include, but is not limited to, information that helps users of financial statements to assess
the nature of the lessee's leasing activities;
variable lease payments (as described in paragraph B49);
extension options and termination options (as described in paragraph B50);
(iii) residual value guarantees (as described in paragraph B51); and
(iv) leases not yet commenced to which the lessee is committed.
If a lessee applies the practical expedient in paragraph 46A, the lessee shall disclose
the amount recognised in profit or loss for the reporting period to reflect changes in lease payments that arise from rent concessions to which the lessee has applied the practical expedient in paragraph 46A.
Classification of leases (paragraphs B53–B58)
A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.
Examples of situations that individually or in combination would normally lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are
the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;
the lessee has the option to purchase the underlying asset at a price that is expected to be sufficiently lower than the fair value at the date the option becomes exercisable for it to be reasonably certain, at the inception date, that the option will be exercised;
the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the underlying asset even if title is not transferred;
at the inception date, the present value of the lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset; and
the underlying asset is of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use it without major modifications.
if the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessor's losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the lessee;
gains or losses from the fluctuation in the fair value of the residual accrue to the lessee (for example, in the form of a rent rebate equaling most of the sales proceeds at the end of the lease); and
the lessee has the ability to continue the lease for a secondary period at a rent that is substantially lower than market rent.
If it is clear from other features that the lease does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset, the lease is classified as an operating lease.
For example, this may be the case if ownership of the underlying asset transfers at the end of the lease for a variable payment equal to its then fair value, or if there are variable lease payments, as a result of which the lessor does not transfer substantially all such risks and rewards.
Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the underlying asset), or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee), do not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.
In the case of a sublease, if the interest rate implicit in the sublease cannot be readily determined, an intermediate lessor may use the discount rate used for the head lease (adjusted for any initial direct costs associated with the sublease) to measure the net investment in the sublease.
Initial measurement of the lease payments included in the net investment in the lease
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments as described in paragraph B42), less any lease incentives payable;
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option (assessed considering the factors described in paragraph B37); and
revenue being the fair value of the underlying asset, or, if lower, the present value of the lease payments accruing to the lessor, discounted using a market rate of interest;
the cost of sale being the cost, or carrying amount if different, of the underlying asset less the present value of the unguaranteed residual value; and
A finance lease of an asset by a manufacturer or dealer lessor gives rise to profit or loss equivalent to the profit or loss resulting from an outright sale of the underlying asset, at normal selling prices, reflecting any applicable volume or trade discounts.
The use of such a rate would result in a lessor recognising an excessive portion of the total income from the transaction at the commencement date.
Costs incurred by manufacturer or dealer lessors in connection with obtaining a finance lease are excluded from the definition of initial direct costs and, thus, are excluded from the net investment in the lease.
A lessor shall apply the lease payments relating to the period against the gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal and the unearned finance income.
A lessor shall review regularly estimated unguaranteed residual values used in computing the gross investment in the lease.
If there has been a reduction in the estimated unguaranteed residual value, the lessor shall revise the income allocation over the lease term and recognise immediately any reduction in respect of amounts accrued.
if the lease would have been classified as an operating lease had the modification been in effect at the inception date, the lessor shall
account for the lease modification as a new lease from the effective date of the modification; and
measure the carrying amount of the underlying asset as the net investment in the lease immediately before the effective date of the lease modification.
The lessor shall apply another systematic basis if that basis is more representative of the pattern in which benefit from the use of the underlying asset is diminished.
finance income on the net investment in the lease; and
for operating leases, lease income, separately disclosing income relating to variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate.
This additional information includes, but is not limited to, information that helps users of financial statements to assess
the nature of the lessor's leasing activities; and
how the lessor manages the risk associated with any rights it retains in underlying assets.
In particular, a lessor shall disclose its risk management strategy for the rights it retains in underlying assets, including any means by which the lessor reduces that risk.
Such means may include, for example, buy-back agreements, residual value guarantees or variable lease payments for use in excess of specified limits.
A lessor shall reconcile the undiscounted lease payments to the net investment in the lease.
The reconciliation shall identify the unearned finance income relating to the lease payments receivable and any discounted unguaranteed residual value.
In applying the disclosure requirements in IAS 16, a lessor shall disaggregate each class of property, plant and equipment into assets subject to operating leases and assets not subject to operating leases.
Accordingly, the seller-lessee shall recognise only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor.
the buyer-lessor shall account for the purchase of the asset applying applicable Standards, and for the lease applying the lessor accounting requirements in this Standard.
any below-market terms shall be accounted for as a prepayment of lease payments; and
any above-market terms shall be accounted for as additional financing provided by the buyer-lessor to the seller-lessee.
the difference between the fair value of the consideration for the sale and the fair value of the asset; and
the difference between the present value of the contractual payments for the lease and the present value of payments for the lease at market rates.

(d) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.
For the lessee, lease payments also include amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees.
Lease payments do not include payments allocated to non-lease components of a contract, unless the lessee elects to combine non-lease components with a lease component and to account for them as a single lease component.
(a) periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and

Terms defined in other Standards and used in this Standard with the same meaning
This Standard specifies the accounting for an individual lease.
However, as a practical expedient, an entity may apply this Standard to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics if the entity reasonably expects that the effects on the financial statements of applying this Standard to the portfolio would not differ materially from applying this Standard to the individual leases within that portfolio.
If accounting for a portfolio, an entity shall use estimates and assumptions that reflect the size and composition of the portfolio.
the contracts are negotiated as a package with an overall commercial objective that cannot be understood without considering the contracts together;
the rights to use underlying assets conveyed in the contracts (or some rights to use underlying assets conveyed in each of the contracts) form a single lease component as described in paragraph B32.
A lessee shall assess the value of an underlying asset based on the value of the asset when it is new, regardless of the age of the asset being leased.
The assessment of whether an underlying asset is of low value is performed on an absolute basis.
The assessment is not affected by the size, nature or circumstances of the lessee.
Accordingly, different lessees are expected to reach the same conclusions about whether a particular underlying asset is of low value.
An underlying asset can be of low value only if
the lessee can benefit from use of the underlying asset on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the lessee; and
the underlying asset is not highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with, other assets.
A lease of an underlying asset does not qualify as a lease of a low-value asset if the nature of the asset is such that, when new, the asset is typically not of low value.
For example, leases of cars would not qualify as leases of low-value assets because a new car would typically not be of low value.
If a lessee subleases an asset, or expects to sublease an asset, the head lease does not qualify as a lease of a low-value asset.
Examples of low-value underlying assets can include tablet and personal computers, small items of office furniture and telephones.
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset (see paragraphs B13–B20) for a period of time, an entity shall assess whether, throughout the period of use, the customer has both of the following
the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset (as described in paragraphs B21–B23); and
the right to direct the use of the identified asset (as described in paragraphs B24–B30).
If the customer has the right to control the use of an identified asset for only a portion of the term of the contract, the contract contains a lease for that portion of the term.
In this case, the joint arrangement is considered to be the customer in the contract.
Accordingly, in assessing whether such a contract contains a lease, an entity shall assess whether the joint arrangement has the right to control the use of an identified asset throughout the period of use.
An entity shall assess whether a contract contains a lease for each potential separate lease component.
Refer to paragraph B32 for guidance on separate lease components.
An asset is typically identified by being explicitly specified in a contract.
However, an asset can also be identified by being implicitly specified at the time that the asset is made available for use by the customer.
Even if an asset is specified, a customer does not have the right to use an identified asset if the supplier has the substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use.
A supplier's right to substitute an asset is substantive only if both of the following conditions exist
the supplier has the practical ability to substitute alternative assets throughout the period of use (for example, the customer cannot prevent the supplier from substituting the asset and alternative assets are readily available to the supplier or could be sourced by the supplier within a reasonable period of time); and
the supplier would benefit economically from the exercise of its right to substitute the asset (ie the economic benefits associated with substituting the asset are expected to exceed the costs associated with substituting the asset).
If the supplier has a right or an obligation to substitute the asset only on or after either a particular date or the occurrence of a specified event, the supplier's substitution right is not substantive because the supplier does not have the practical ability to substitute alternative assets throughout the period of use.
An entity's evaluation of whether a supplier's substitution right is substantive is based on facts and circumstances at inception of the contract and shall exclude consideration of future events that, at inception of the contract, are not considered likely to occur.
Examples of future events that, at inception of the contract, would not be considered likely to occur and, thus, should be excluded from the evaluation include
an agreement by a future customer to pay an above market rate for use of the asset;
the introduction of new technology that is not substantially developed at inception of the contract;
a substantial difference between the customer's use of the asset, or the performance of the asset, and the use or performance considered likely at inception of the contract; and
a substantial difference between the market price of the asset during the period of use, and the market price considered likely at inception of the contract.
If the asset is located at the customer's premises or elsewhere, the costs associated with substitution are generally higher than when located at the supplier's premises and, therefore, are more likely to exceed the benefits associated with substituting the asset.
The supplier's right or obligation to substitute the asset for repairs and maintenance, if the asset is not operating properly or if a technical upgrade becomes available does not preclude the customer from having the right to use an identified asset.
If the customer cannot readily determine whether the supplier has a substantive substitution right, the customer shall presume that any substitution right is not substantive.
A capacity portion of an asset is an identified asset if it is physically distinct (for example, a floor of a building).
A capacity or other portion of an asset that is not physically distinct (for example, a capacity portion of a fibre optic cable) is not an identified asset, unless it represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset and thereby provides the customer with the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset.
Right to obtain economic benefits from use
To control the use of an identified asset, a customer is required to have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use (for example, by having exclusive use of the asset throughout that period).
A customer can obtain economic benefits from use of an asset directly or indirectly in many ways, such as by using, holding or sub-leasing the asset.
When assessing the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of an asset, an entity shall consider the economic benefits that result from use of the asset within the defined scope of a customer's right to use the asset (see paragraph B30).
if a contract specifies that a customer can drive a motor vehicle only up to a particular number of miles during the period of use, an entity shall consider only the economic benefits from use of the motor vehicle for the permitted mileage, and not beyond.
If a contract requires a customer to pay the supplier or another party a portion of the cash flows derived from use of an asset as consideration, those cash flows paid as consideration shall be considered to be part of the economic benefits that the customer obtains from use of the asset.
For example, if the customer is required to pay the supplier a percentage of sales from use of retail space as consideration for that use, that requirement does not prevent the customer from having the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the retail space.
This is because the cash flows arising from those sales are considered to be economic benefits that the customer obtains from use of the retail space, a portion of which it then pays to the supplier as consideration for the right to use that space.
Right to direct the use
A customer has the right to direct the use of an identified asset throughout the period of use only if either
the customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use (as described in paragraphs B25–B30); or
the relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used are predetermined and
the customer has the right to operate the asset (or to direct others to operate the asset in a manner that it determines) throughout the period of use, without the supplier having the right to change those operating instructions; or
the customer designed the asset (or specific aspects of the asset) in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the asset will be used throughout the period of use.
How and for what purpose the asset is used
A customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used if, within the scope of its right of use defined in the contract, it can change how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use.
In making this assessment, an entity considers the decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use.
Decision-making rights are relevant when they affect the economic benefits to be derived from use.
The decision-making rights that are most relevant are likely to be different for different contracts, depending on the nature of the asset and the terms and conditions of the contract.
Examples of decision-making rights that, depending on the circumstances, grant the right to change how and for what purpose the asset is used, within the defined scope of the customer's right of use, include
rights to change the type of output that is produced by the asset (for example, to decide whether to use a shipping container to transport goods or for storage, or to decide upon the mix of products sold from retail space);
rights to change when the output is produced (for example, to decide when an item of machinery or a power plant will be used);
rights to change where the output is produced (for example, to decide upon the destination of a truck or a ship, or to decide where an item of equipment is used); and
rights to change whether the output is produced, and the quantity of that output (for example, to decide whether to produce energy from a power plant and how much energy to produce from that power plant).
Examples of decision-making rights that do not grant the right to change how and for what purpose the asset is used include rights that are limited to operating or maintaining the asset.
Such rights can be held by the customer or the supplier.
Although rights such as those to operate or maintain an asset are often essential to the efficient use of an asset, they are not rights to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used and are often dependent on the decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used.
However, rights to operate an asset may grant the customer the right to direct the use of the asset if the relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used are predetermined (see paragraph B24(b)(i)).
Decisions determined during and before the period of use
The relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used can be predetermined in a number of ways.
For example, the relevant decisions can be predetermined by the design of the asset or by contractual restrictions on the use of the asset.
In assessing whether a customer has the right to direct the use of an asset, an entity shall consider only rights to make decisions about the use of the asset during the period of use, unless the customer designed the asset (or specific aspects of the asset) as described in paragraph B24(b)(ii).
Consequently, unless the conditions in paragraph B24(b)(ii) exist, an entity shall not consider decisions that are predetermined before the period of use.
For example, if a customer is able only to specify the output of an asset before the period of use, the customer does not have the right to direct the use of that asset.
The ability to specify the output in a contract before the period of use, without any other decision-making rights relating to the use of the asset, gives a customer the same rights as any customer that purchases goods or services.
A contract may include terms and conditions designed to protect the supplier's interest in the asset or other assets, to protect its personnel, or to ensure the supplier's compliance with laws or regulations.
These are examples of protective rights.
For example, a contract may (i) specify the maximum amount of use of an asset or limit where or when the customer can use the asset, (ii) require a customer to follow particular operating practices, or (iii) require a customer to inform the supplier of changes in how an asset will be used.
Protective rights typically define the scope of the customer's right of use but do not, in isolation, prevent the customer from having the right to direct the use of an asset.
The following flowchart may assist entities in making the assessment of whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.
The right to use an underlying asset is a separate lease component if both
the underlying asset is neither highly dependent on, nor highly interrelated with, the other underlying assets in the contract.
For example, the fact that a lessee could decide not to lease the underlying asset without significantly affecting its rights to use other underlying assets in the contract might indicate that the underlying asset is not highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with, those other underlying assets.
A contract may include an amount payable by the lessee for activities and costs that do not transfer a good or service to the lessee.
For example, a lessor may include in the total amount payable a charge for administrative tasks, or other costs it incurs associated with the lease, that do not transfer a good or service to the lessee.
Such amounts payable do not give rise to a separate component of the contract, but are considered to be part of the total consideration that is allocated to the separately identified components of the contract.
In determining the lease term and assessing the length of the non-cancellable period of a lease, an entity shall apply the definition of a contract and determine the period for which the contract is enforceable.
A lease is no longer enforceable when the lessee and the lessor each has the right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty.
If only a lessee has the right to terminate a lease, that right is considered to be an option to terminate the lease available to the lessee that an entity considers when determining the lease term.
If only a lessor has the right to terminate a lease, the non-cancellable period of the lease includes the period covered by the option to terminate the lease.
The lease term begins at the commencement date and includes any rent-free periods provided to the lessee by the lessor.
At the commencement date, an entity assesses whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or to purchase the underlying asset, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease.
The entity considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise, or not to exercise, the option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option.
Examples of factors to consider include, but are not limited to
the amount of payments for the lease in any optional period;
the amount of any variable payments for the lease or other contingent payments, such as payments resulting from termination penalties and residual value guarantees; and
(iii) the terms and conditions of any options that are exercisable after initial optional periods (for example, a purchase option that is exercisable at the end of an extension period at a rate that is currently below market rates).
significant leasehold improvements undertaken (or expected to be undertaken) over the term of the contract that are expected to have significant economic benefit for the lessee when the option to extend or terminate the lease, or to purchase the underlying asset, becomes exercisable;
the importance of that underlying asset to the lessee's operations, considering, for example, whether the underlying asset is a specialised asset, the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives; and
conditionality associated with exercising the option (ie when the option can be exercised only if one or more conditions are met), and the likelihood that those conditions will exist.
In such cases, and notwithstanding the guidance on in-substance fixed payments in paragraph B42, an entity shall assume that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease.
The shorter the non-cancellable period of a lease, the more likely a lessee is to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease.
This is because the costs associated with obtaining a replacement asset are likely to be proportionately higher the shorter the non-cancellable period.
A lessee's past practice regarding the period over which it has typically used particular types of assets (whether leased or owned), and its economic reasons for doing so, may provide information that is helpful in assessing whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, or not to exercise, an option.
For example, if a lessee has typically used particular types of assets for a particular period of time or if the lessee has a practice of frequently exercising options on leases of particular types of underlying assets, the lessee shall consider the economic reasons for that past practice in assessing whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an option on leases of those assets.
Examples of significant events or changes in circumstances include
significant leasehold improvements not anticipated at the commencement date that are expected to have significant economic benefit for the lessee when the option to extend or terminate the lease, or to purchase the underlying asset, becomes exercisable;
a significant modification to, or customisation of, the underlying asset that was not anticipated at the commencement date;
the inception of a sublease of the underlying asset for a period beyond the end of the previously determined lease term; and
a business decision of the lessee that is directly relevant to exercising, or not exercising, an option (for example, a decision to extend the lease of a complementary asset, to dispose of an alternative asset or to dispose of a business unit within which the right-of-use asset is employed).
In-substance fixed lease payments (paragraphs 27(a), 36(c) and 70(a))
Lease payments include any in-substance fixed lease payments.
In-substance fixed lease payments are payments that may, in form, contain variability but that, in substance, are unavoidable.
In-substance fixed lease payments exist, for example, if
Examples of those types of payments include
payments that must be made only if an asset is proven to be capable of operating during the lease, or only if an event occurs that has no genuine possibility of not occurring; or
payments that are initially structured as variable lease payments linked to the use of the underlying asset but for which the variability will be resolved at some point after the commencement date so that the payments become fixed for the remainder of the lease term.
Those payments become in-substance fixed payments when the variability is resolved.
In this case, an entity shall consider the realistic set of payments to be lease payments.
Lessee involvement with the underlying asset before the commencement date
Costs of the lessee relating to the construction or design of the underlying asset
An entity may negotiate a lease before the underlying asset is available for use by the lessee.
For some leases, the underlying asset may need to be constructed or redesigned for use by the lessee.
Depending on the terms and conditions of the contract, a lessee may be required to make payments relating to the construction or design of the asset.
Legal title to the underlying asset
A lessee may obtain legal title to an underlying asset before that legal title is transferred to the lessor and the asset is leased to the lessee.
Obtaining legal title does not in itself determine how to account for the transaction.
However, if the lessee does not obtain control of the underlying asset before the asset is transferred to the lessor, the transaction is not a sale and leaseback transaction.
In this case, if the lessee obtains legal title to the underlying asset but does not obtain control of the asset before it is transferred to the lessor, the transaction is not accounted for as a sale and leaseback transaction, but as a lease.
(iv) exposure to other risks arising from leases.
the lessee's reasons for using variable lease payments and the prevalence of those payments;
the relative magnitude of variable lease payments to fixed payments;
key variables upon which variable lease payments depend and how payments are expected to vary in response to changes in those key variables; and
other operational and financial effects of variable lease payments.
the lessee's reasons for using extension options or termination options and the prevalence of those options;
the relative magnitude of optional lease payments to lease payments;
the prevalence of the exercise of options that were not included in the measurement of lease liabilities; and
other operational and financial effects of those options.
the lessee's reasons for providing residual value guarantees and the prevalence of those guarantees;
the magnitude of a lessee's exposure to residual value risk;
the nature of underlying assets for which those guarantees are provided; and
other operational and financial effects of those guarantees.
the lessee's reasons for sale and leaseback transactions and the prevalence of those transactions;
key terms and conditions of individual sale and leaseback transactions;
payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities; and
The classification of leases for lessors in this Standard is based on the extent to which the lease transfers the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.
Risks include the possibilities of losses from idle capacity or technological obsolescence and of variations in return because of changing economic conditions.
Rewards may be represented by the expectation of profitable operation over the underlying asset's economic life and of gain from appreciation in value or realisation of a residual value.
A lease contract may include terms and conditions to adjust the lease payments for particular changes that occur between the inception date and the commencement date (such as a change in the lessor's cost of the underlying asset or a change in the lessor's cost of financing the lease).
In that case, for the purposes of classifying the lease, the effect of any such changes shall be deemed to have taken place at the inception date.
In determining whether the land element is an operating lease or a finance lease, an important consideration is that land normally has an indefinite economic life.
Whenever necessary in order to classify and account for a lease of land and buildings, a lessor shall allocate lease payments (including any lump-sum upfront payments) between the land and the buildings elements in proportion to the relative fair values of the leasehold interests in the land element and buildings element of the lease at the inception date.
In such a case, a lessor shall regard the economic life of the buildings as the economic life of the entire underlying asset.
In classifying a sublease, an intermediate lessor shall classify the sublease as a finance lease or an operating lease as follows
otherwise, the sublease shall be classified by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, rather than by reference to the underlying asset (for example, the item of property, plant or equipment that is the subject of the lease).
This appendix is an integral part of the Standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.
If an entity applies this Standard earlier, it shall disclose that fact.
For the purposes of the requirements in paragraphs C1–C19, the date of initial application is the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity first applies this Standard.
As a practical expedient, an entity is not required to reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of initial application.
Instead, the entity is permitted
If an entity chooses the practical expedient in paragraph C3, it shall disclose that fact and apply the practical expedient to all of its contracts.
A lessee shall apply this Standard to its leases either
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the Standard recognised at the date of initial application in accordance with paragraphs C7–C13.
A lessee shall apply the election described in paragraph C5 consistently to all of its leases in which it is a lessee.
If a lessee elects to apply this Standard in accordance with paragraph C5(b), the lessee shall not restate comparative information.
Instead, the lessee shall recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying this Standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at the date of initial application.
Leases previously classified as operating leases
If a lessee elects to apply this Standard in accordance with paragraph C5(b), the lessee shall
its carrying amount as if the Standard had been applied since the commencement date, but discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application; or
an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the statement of financial position immediately before the date of initial application.
The lessee shall account for those leases applying this Standard from the date of initial application.
a lessee may apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics (such as leases with a similar remaining lease term for a similar class of underlying asset in a similar economic environment).
a lessee may exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application.
a lessee may use hindsight, such as in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.
Leases previously classified as finance leases
For those leases, a lessee shall account for the right-of-use asset and the lease liability applying this Standard from the date of initial application.
the weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position at the date of initial application; and
an explanation of any difference between
lease liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position at the date of initial application.
The intermediate lessor shall perform this assessment at the date of initial application on the basis of the remaining contractual terms and conditions of the head lease and sublease at that date.
If a sale and leaseback transaction was accounted for as a sale and a finance lease applying IAS 17, the seller-lessee shall
account for the leaseback in the same way as it accounts for any other finance lease that exists at the date of initial application; and
continue to amortise any gain on sale over the lease term.
If a sale and leaseback transaction was accounted for as a sale and operating lease applying IAS 17, the seller-lessee shall
account for the leaseback in the same way as it accounts for any other operating lease that exists at the date of initial application; and
Amounts previously recognised in respect of business combinations
Covid-19-related rent concessions for lessees
This Standard supersedes the following Standards and Interpretations
The following examples illustrate how an entity determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.
The contract specifies the rail cars; the cars are owned by Supplier.
Customer determines when, where and which goods are to be transported using the cars.
When the cars are not in use, they are kept at Customer's premises.
Customer can use the cars for another purpose (for example, storage) if it so chooses.
However, the contract specifies that Customer cannot transport particular types of cargo (for example, explosives).
If a particular car needs to be serviced or repaired, Supplier is required to substitute a car of the same type.
The contract also requires Supplier to provide an engine and a driver when requested by Customer.
Supplier keeps the engines at its premises and provides instructions to the driver detailing Customer's requests to transport goods.
The contract contains leases of rail cars.
Once delivered to Customer, the cars can be substituted only when they need to be serviced or repaired (see paragraph B18).
The engine used to transport the rail cars is not an identified asset because it is neither explicitly specified nor implicitly specified in the contract.
Customer has exclusive use of the cars throughout the period of use, including when they are not being used to transport Customer's goods.
(b) Customer has the right to direct the use of the cars because the conditions in paragraph B24(a) exist.
The contractual restrictions on the cargo that can be transported by the cars are protective rights of Supplier and define the scope of Customer's right to use the cars.
Within the scope of its right of use defined in the contract, Customer makes the relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the cars are used by being able to decide when and where the rail cars will be used and which goods are transported using the cars.
Customer also determines whether and how the cars will be used when not being used to transport its goods (for example, whether and when they will be used for storage).
Although having an engine and driver (controlled by Supplier) to transport the rail cars is essential to the efficient use of the cars, Supplier's decisions in this regard do not give it the right to direct how and for what purpose the rail cars are used.
Consequently, Supplier does not control the use of the cars during the period of use.
Supplier provides the rail cars, driver and engine as part of the contract.
The contract states the nature and quantity of the goods to be transported (and the type of rail car to be used to transport the goods).
Supplier has a large pool of similar cars that can be used to fulfil the requirements of the contract.
The cars and engines are stored at Supplier's premises when not being used to transport goods.
The contract does not contain a lease of rail cars or of an engine.
The rail cars and the engines used to transport Customer's goods are not identified assets.
Supplier has the substantive right to substitute the rail cars and engine because
(a) Supplier has the practical ability to substitute each car and the engine throughout the period of use (see paragraph B14(a)).
Alternative cars and engines are readily available to Supplier and Supplier can substitute each car and the engine without Customer's approval.
(b) Supplier would benefit economically from substituting each car and the engine (see paragraph B14(b)).
There would be minimal, if any, cost associated with substituting each car or the engine because the cars and engines are stored at Supplier's premises and Supplier has a large pool of similar cars and engines.
Supplier benefits from substituting each car or the engine in contracts of this nature because substitution allows Supplier to, for example, (i) use cars or an engine to fulfil a task for which the cars or engine are already positioned to perform (for example, a task at a rail yard close to the point of origin) or (ii) use cars or an engine that would otherwise be sitting idle because they are not being used by a customer.
Accordingly, Customer does not direct the use, nor have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use, of an identified car or an engine.
Supplier directs the use of the rail cars and engine by selecting which cars and engine are used for each particular delivery and obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the rail cars and engine.
Supplier is only providing freight capacity.
Supplier has the right to change the location of the space allocated to Customer at any time during the period of use.
There are minimal costs to Supplier associated with changing the space for the Customer: Customer uses a kiosk (that it owns) that can be moved easily to sell its goods.
There are many areas in the airport that are available and that would meet the specifications for the space in the contract.
The contract does not contain a lease.
Although the amount of space Customer uses is specified in the contract, there is no identified asset.
However, the contract is for space in the airport, and this space can change at the discretion of Supplier.
Supplier has the substantive right to substitute the space Customer uses because
(a) Supplier has the practical ability to change the space used by Customer throughout the period of use (see paragraph B14(a)).
There are many areas in the airport that meet the specifications for the space in the contract, and Supplier has the right to change the location of the space to other space that meets the specifications at any time without Customer's approval.
(b) Supplier would benefit economically from substituting the space (see paragraph B14(b)).
There would be minimal cost associated with changing the space used by Customer because the kiosk can be moved easily.
Supplier benefits from substituting the space in the airport because substitution allows Supplier to make the most effective use of the space at boarding areas in the airport to meet changing circumstances.
Customer makes the decisions about the use of the fibres by connecting each end of the fibres to its electronic equipment (ie Customer 'lights' the fibres and decides what data, and how much data, those fibres will transport).
If the fibres are damaged, Supplier is responsible for the repairs and maintenance.
Supplier owns extra fibres, but can substitute those for Customer's fibres only for reasons of repairs, maintenance or malfunction (and is obliged to substitute the fibres in these cases).
The contract contains a lease of dark fibres.
The fibres are explicitly specified in the contract and are physically distinct from other fibres within the cable.
Supplier cannot substitute the fibres other than for reasons of repairs, maintenance or malfunction (see paragraph B18).
Customer has exclusive use of the fibres throughout the period of use.
(b) Customer has the right to direct the use of the fibres because the conditions in paragraph B24(a) exist.
Although Supplier's decisions about repairing and maintaining the fibres are essential to their efficient use, those decisions do not give Supplier the right to direct how and for what purpose the fibres are used.
Consequently, Supplier does not control the use of the fibres during the period of use.
Supplier makes decisions about the transmission of data (ie Supplier lights the fibres, makes decisions about which fibres are used to transmit Customer's traffic and makes decisions about the electronic equipment that Supplier owns and connects to the fibres).
Supplier makes all decisions about the transmission of its customers' data, which requires the use of only a portion of the capacity of the cable for each customer.
The capacity portion that will be provided to Customer is not physically distinct from the remaining capacity of the cable and does not represent substantially all of the capacity of the cable (see paragraph B20).
Consequently, Customer does not have the right to use an identified asset.
Retail Unit A is part of a larger retail space with many retail units.
Customer is granted the right to use Retail Unit A. Supplier can require Customer to relocate to another retail unit. In that case, Supplier is required to provide Customer with a retail unit of similar quality and specifications to Retail Unit A and to pay for Customer's relocation costs.
Supplier would benefit economically from relocating Customer only if a major new tenant were to decide to occupy a large amount of retail space at a rate sufficiently favourable to cover the costs of relocating Customer and other tenants in the retail space.
However, although it is possible that those circumstances will arise, at inception of the contract, it is not likely that those circumstances will arise.
Customer makes all of the decisions about the use of the retail unit during the period of use.
For example, Customer decides on the mix of goods sold from the unit, the pricing of the goods sold and the quantities of inventory held.
The contract requires Customer to make fixed payments to Supplier, as well as variable payments that are a percentage of sales from Retail Unit A.
Supplier provides cleaning and security services, as well as advertising services, as part of the contract.
The contract contains a lease of retail space.
Retail Unit A is an identified asset.
It is explicitly specified in the contract.
Supplier has the practical ability to substitute the retail unit, but could benefit economically from substitution only in specific circumstances.
Supplier's substitution right is not substantive because, at inception of the contract, those circumstances are not considered likely to arise (see paragraph B16).
Although a portion of the cash flows derived from sales from Retail Unit A will flow from Customer to Supplier, this represents consideration that Customer pays Supplier for the right to use the retail unit.
It does not prevent Customer from having the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of Retail Unit A.
(b) Customer has the right to direct the use of Retail Unit A because the conditions in paragraph B24(a) exist.
Supplier does not have substitution rights.
Only cargo specified in the contract is permitted to be transported on this truck for the period of the contract.
The contract specifies a maximum distance that the truck can be driven.
Customer does not have the right to continue using the truck after the specified trip is complete.
The cargo to be transported, and the timing and location of pick-up in New York and delivery in San Francisco, are specified in the contract.
Customer is responsible for driving the truck from New York to San Francisco.
The contract contains a lease of a truck.
Customer has the right to use the truck for the duration of the specified trip.
There is an identified asset.
The truck is explicitly specified in the contract, and Supplier does not have the right to substitute the truck.
Customer has the right to control the use of the truck throughout the period of use because
(a) Customer has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the truck over the period of use.
Customer has exclusive use of the truck throughout the period of use.
(b) Customer has the right to direct the use of the truck because the conditions in B24(b)(i) exist.
How and for what purpose the truck will be used (ie the transportation of specified cargo from New York to San Francisco within a specified timeframe) is predetermined in the contract.
Customer directs the use of the truck because it has the right to operate the truck (for example, speed, route, rest stops) throughout the period of use.
Customer makes all of the decisions about the use of the truck that can be made during the period of use through its control of the operations of the truck.
The cargo will occupy substantially all of the capacity of the ship.
The contract specifies the cargo to be transported on the ship and the dates of pickup and delivery.
Supplier operates and maintains the ship and is responsible for the safe passage of the cargo on board the ship.
Customer is prohibited from hiring another operator for the ship or operating the ship itself during the term of the contract.
The ship is explicitly specified in the contract and Supplier does not have the right to substitute that specified ship.
Customer has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the ship over the period of use.
Its cargo will occupy substantially all of the capacity of the ship, thereby preventing other parties from obtaining economic benefits from use of the ship.
However, Customer does not have the right to control the use of the ship because it does not have the right to direct its use.
Customer does not have the right to direct how and for what purpose the ship is used.
How and for what purpose the ship will be used (ie the transportation of specified cargo from Rotterdam to Sydney within a specified timeframe) is predetermined in the contract.
Customer has no right to change how and for what purpose the ship is used during the period of use.
Customer has no other decision-making rights about the use of the ship during the period of use (for example, it does not have the right to operate the ship) and did not design the ship.
Those restrictions prevent Customer from sailing the ship into waters at a high risk of piracy or carrying hazardous materials as cargo.
Customer is prohibited from hiring another operator for the ship of the contract or operating the ship itself during the term of the contract.
The contract contains a lease.
The ship is explicitly specified in the contract, and Supplier does not have the right to substitute that specified ship.
Customer has exclusive use of the ship throughout the period of use.
(b) Customer has the right to direct the use of the ship because the conditions in paragraph B24(a) exist.
The contractual restrictions about where the ship can sail and the cargo to be transported by the ship define the scope of Customer's right to use the ship.
They are protective rights that protect Supplier's investment in the ship and Supplier's personnel.
Although the operation and maintenance of the ship are essential to its efficient use, Supplier's decisions in this regard do not give it the right to direct how and for what purpose the ship is used.
Instead, Supplier's decisions are dependent upon Customer's decisions about how and for what purpose the ship is used.
The contract details the interior and exterior specifications for the aircraft.
There are contractual and legal restrictions in the contract on where the aircraft can fly.
Subject to those restrictions, Customer determines where and when the aircraft will fly, and which passengers and cargo will be transported on the aircraft.
Supplier is responsible for operating the aircraft, using its own crew.
Customer is prohibited from hiring another operator for the aircraft or operating the aircraft itself during the term of the contract.
Any substitute aircraft must meet the interior and exterior specifications in the contract.
There are significant costs involved in outfitting an aircraft in Supplier's fleet to meet Customer's specifications.
The aircraft is explicitly specified in the contract and, although Supplier can substitute the aircraft, its substitution right is not substantive because the conditions in paragraph B14(b) do not exist.
Supplier's substitution right is not substantive because of the significant costs involved in outfitting another aircraft to meet the specifications required by the contract such that Supplier is not expected to benefit economically from substituting the aircraft.
Customer has exclusive use of the aircraft throughout the period of use.
(b) Customer has the right to direct the use of the aircraft because the conditions in paragraph B24(a) exist.
The restrictions on where the aircraft can fly define the scope of Customer's right to use the aircraft.
Although the operation of the aircraft is essential to its efficient use, Supplier's decisions in this regard do not give it the right to direct how and for what purpose the aircraft is used.
Consequently, Supplier does not control the use of the aircraft during the period of use and Supplier's decisions do not affect Customer's control of the use of the aircraft.
The type, quality and quantity of shirts are specified in the contract.
The capacity of the factory exceeds the output for which Customer has contracted (ie Customer has not contracted for substantially all of the capacity of the factory).
Supplier makes all decisions about the operations of the factory, including the production level at which to run the factory and which customer contracts to fulfil with the output of the factory that is not used to fulfil Customer's contract.
The factory is an identified asset.
The factory is implicitly specified because Supplier can fulfil the contract only through the use of this asset.
Customer does not control the use of the factory because it does not have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the factory.
This is because Supplier could decide to use the factory to fulfil other customer contracts during the period of use.
Customer also does not control the use of the factory because it does not have the right to direct the use of the factory.
Customer's rights are limited to specifying output from the factory in the contract with Supplier.
Customer has the same rights regarding the use of the factory as other customers purchasing shirts from the factory.
Supplier has the right to direct the use of the factory because Supplier can decide how and for what purpose the factory is used (ie Supplier has the right to decide the production level at which to run the factory and which customer contracts to fulfil with the output produced).
Either the fact that Customer does not have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the factory, or that Customer does not have the right to direct the use of the factory, would be sufficient in isolation to conclude that Customer does not control the use of the factory.
The solar farm is explicitly specified in the contract and Supplier has no substitution rights.
The solar farm is owned by Supplier and the energy cannot be provided to Customer from another asset.
Customer designed the solar farm before it was constructed — Customer hired experts in solar energy to assist in determining the location of the farm and the engineering of the equipment to be used.
Supplier is responsible for building the solar farm to Customer's specifications, and then operating and maintaining it.
There are no decisions to be made about whether, when or how much electricity will be produced because the design of the asset has predetermined those decisions.
Supplier will receive tax credits relating to the construction and ownership of the solar farm, while Customer receives renewable energy credits that accrue from use of the solar farm.
There is an identified asset because the solar farm is explicitly specified in the contract, and Supplier does not have the right to substitute the specified solar farm.
Although Supplier will receive economic benefits from the solar farm in the form of tax credits, those economic benefits relate to the ownership of the solar farm rather than the use of the solar farm and, thus, are not considered in this assessment.
(b) Customer has the right to direct the use of the solar farm because the conditions in paragraph B24(b)(ii) exist.
Neither Customer, nor Supplier, decides how and for what purpose the solar farm is used during the period of use because those decisions are predetermined by the design of the asset (ie the design of the solar farm has, in effect, programmed into the asset any relevant decision-making rights about how and for what purpose the solar farm is used throughout the period of use).
However, Customer's design of the solar farm has given it the right to direct the use of the farm.
Because the design of the solar farm has predetermined how and for what purpose the asset will be used throughout the period of use, Customer's control over that design is substantively no different from Customer controlling those decisions.
The power plant is owned and operated by Supplier.
Supplier is unable to provide power to Customer from another plant.
The contract sets out the quantity and timing of power that the power plant will produce throughout the period of use, which cannot be changed in the absence of extraordinary circumstances (for example, emergency situations).
There is an identified asset because the power plant is explicitly specified in the contract, and Supplier does not have the right to substitute the specified plant.
However, Customer does not have the right to control the use of the power plant because it does not have the right to direct its use.
Customer does not have the right to direct how and for what purpose the plant is used.
Customer has no right to change how and for what purpose the plant is used during the period of use.
Customer has no other decision-making rights about the use of the power plant during the period of use (for example, it does not operate the power plant) and did not design the plant.
Supplier is the only party that can make decisions about the plant during the period of use by making the decisions about how the plant is operated and maintained.
The contract states that Customer has rights to all of the power produced by the plant (ie Supplier cannot use the plant to fulfil other contracts).
Customer issues instructions to Supplier about the quantity and timing of the delivery of power.
If the plant is not producing power for Customer, it does not operate.
The power plant is explicitly specified in the contract and Supplier does not have the right to substitute the specified plant.
(b) Customer has the right to direct the use of the power plant because the conditions in paragraph B24(a) exist.
Customer makes the relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the power plant is used because it has the right to determine whether, when and how much power the plant will produce (ie the timing and quantity, if any, of power produced) throughout the period of use.
Because Supplier is prevented from using the power plant for another purpose, Customer's decision-making about the timing and quantity of power produced, in effect, determines when, and whether, the plant produces output.
Although the operation and maintenance of the power plant are essential to its efficient use, Supplier's decisions in this regard do not give it the right to direct how and for what purpose the power plant is used.
Consequently, Supplier does not control the use of the power plant during the period of use.
Instead, Supplier's decisions are dependent upon Customer's decisions about how and for what purpose the power plant is used.
The contract requires Supplier to supply network services that meet a specified quality level.
Supplier can reconfigure or replace the servers when needed to continuously provide the quality of network services defined in the contract.
Customer does not operate the servers or make any significant decisions about their use.
Instead, the contract is a service contract in which Supplier uses the equipment to meet the level of network services determined by Customer.
There is no need to assess whether the servers installed at Customer's premises are identified assets.
This assessment would not change the analysis of whether the contract contains a lease because Customer does not have the right to control the use of the servers.
Customer does not control the use of the servers because Customer's only decision-making rights relate to deciding upon the level of network services (the output of the servers) before the period of use — the level of network services cannot be changed during the period of use without modifying the contract.
For example, even though Customer produces the data to be transported, that activity does not directly affect the configuration of the network services and, thus, it does not affect how and for what purpose the servers are used.
Supplier is the only party that can make relevant decisions about the use of the servers during the period of use.
Supplier has the right to decide how data is transported using the servers, whether to reconfigure the servers and whether to use the servers for another purpose.
Supplier delivers and installs the server at Customer's premises in accordance with Customer's instructions, and provides repair and maintenance services for the server, as needed, throughout the period of use.
Supplier substitutes the server only in the case of malfunction.
Customer decides which data to store on the server and how to integrate the server within its operations.
Customer can change its decisions in this regard throughout the period of use.
The server is explicitly specified in the contract.
Supplier can substitute the server only if it is malfunctioning (see paragraph B18).
Customer has exclusive use of the server throughout the period of use.
(b) Customer has the right to direct the use of the server (because the conditions in paragraph B24(a) exist).
Customer makes the relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the server is used because it has the right to decide which aspect of its operations the server is used to support and which data it stores on the server.
Customer is the only party that can make decisions about the use of the server during the period of use.
A lessee in the pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution industry (Lessee) has the following leases
(a) leases of real estate (both office buildings and warehouses).
(b) leases of manufacturing equipment.
(c) leases of company cars, both for sales personnel and senior management and of varying quality, specification and value.
(e) leases of IT equipment for use by individual employees (such as laptop computers, desktop computers, hand held computer devices, desktop printers and mobile phones).
(f) leases of servers, including many individual modules that increase the storage capacity of those servers.
The modules have been added to the mainframe servers over time as Lessee has needed to increase the storage capacity of the servers.
(g) leases of office equipment
(i) office furniture (such as chairs, desks and office partitions);
(iii) high-capacity multifunction photocopier devices.
Lessee determines that the following leases qualify as leases of low-value assets on the basis that the underlying assets, when new, are individually of low value
(a) leases of IT equipment for use by individual employees; and
Although each module within the servers, if considered individually, might be an asset of low value, the leases of modules within the servers do not qualify as leases of low-value assets.
This is because each module is highly interrelated with other parts of the servers.
Lessee would not lease the modules without also leasing the servers.
In doing so, Lessee groups its company cars, trucks and vans into portfolios.
Lessee's company cars are leased under a series of master lease agreements.
Lessee has a master lease agreement for each different type of company car.
Lessee's trucks and vans are leased under individual lease agreements.
All of the truck leases have similar terms, as do all of the van leases.
The following example illustrates the allocation of consideration in a contract to lease and non-lease components by a lessee.
Lessor also agrees to maintain each item of equipment throughout the lease term.
The consideration includes the cost of maintenance services for each item of equipment.
Lessee's ability to derive benefit from the lease of each item of equipment is not significantly affected by its decision to lease, or not lease, the other equipment from Lessor.
Several suppliers provide maintenance services for a similar bulldozer and a similar truck.
The long-reach excavator is highly specialised and, accordingly, other suppliers do not lease or provide maintenance services for similar excavators.
Lessee allocates all of the variable consideration to the maintenance of the long-reach excavator, and, thus, to the non-lease components of the contract.
Lessee then accounts for each lease component applying the guidance in IFRS 16, treating the allocated consideration as the lease payments for each lease component.
The following example illustrates how a lessee measures right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
It also illustrates how a lessee accounts for a change in the lease term.
The interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.
Lessee initially recognises assets and liabilities in relation to the lease as follows.
This is because costs incurred on leasehold improvements by Lessee are not included within the cost of the right-of-use asset.
The acquisition of Entity A and the relocation of Entity A's staff is a significant event that is within the control of Lessee and affects whether Lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the extension option not previously included in its determination of the lease term.
This is because the original floor has greater utility (and thus provides greater benefits) to Lessee than alternative assets that could be leased for a similar amount to the lease payments for the optional period — Lessee would incur additional costs if it were to lease a similar floor in a different building because the workforce would be located in different buildings.
The corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset to reflect the cost of the additional right of use, recognised as follows.
The following example illustrates how a lessee accounts for variable lease payments that depend on an index and variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability.
The rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.
The corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset, recognised as follows.
At the commencement date, Lessee measures the right-of-use asset and the lease liability recognised at the same amounts as in Example 14A.
This is because the additional variable lease payments are linked to future sales and, thus, do not meet the definition of lease payments.
Consequently, those payments are not included in the measurement of the asset and liability.
This is because the modification grants Lessee an additional right to use an underlying asset, and the increase in consideration for the lease is commensurate with the stand-alone price of the additional right-of-use adjusted to reflect the circumstances of the contract.
The interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined.
The pre-modification right-of-use asset and the pre-modification lease liability in relation to the lease are as follows.
Decrease in the lease term
Increase in the leased space
The modified right-of-use asset and the modified lease liability in relation to the modified lease are as follows.
The intermediate lessor classifies the sublease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.
When the intermediate lessor enters into the sublease, the intermediate lessor
(a) derecognises the right-of-use asset relating to the head lease that it transfers to the sublessee and recognises the net investment in the sublease;
(b) recognises any difference between the right-of-use asset and the net investment in the sublease in profit or loss; and
(c) retains the lease liability relating to the head lease in its statement of financial position, which represents the lease payments owed to the head lessor.
During the term of the sublease, the intermediate lessor recognises both finance income on the sublease and interest expense on the head lease.
When the intermediate lessor enters into the sublease, the intermediate lessor retains the lease liability and the right-of-use asset relating to the head lease in its statement of financial position.
During the term of the sublease, the intermediate lessor
(a) recognises a depreciation charge for the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease liability; and
(b) recognises lease income from the sublease.
Lessee's group policy is to negotiate variable payment terms for newly established stores.
Lessee concludes that information about variable lease payments is relevant to users of its financial statements and is not available elsewhere in its financial statements.
In particular, Lessee concludes that information about the proportion of total lease payments that arise from variable payments, and the sensitivity of those variable lease payments to changes in sales, is the information that is relevant to users of its financial statements.
Some of the property leases within the group contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated from the store.
Variable payment terms are used, when possible, in newly established stores in order to link rental payments to store cash flows and minimise fixed costs.
Lessee's group policy sets out the circumstances in which variable payment terms are used and all lease negotiations must be approved centrally.
Lease payments are monitored centrally.
In particular, Lessee concludes that information about the different types of contractual terms it uses with respect to variable lease payments, the effect of those terms on its financial performance and the sensitivity of variable lease payments to changes in sales is the information that is relevant to users of its financial statements.
This is similar to the information that is reported to Lessee's senior management about variable lease payments.
These terms are used, when possible, in order to match lease payments with stores generating higher cash flows.
Variable rent with no minimum
Lessee with a high volume of leases with a wide range of different payment terms
These leases contain a wide range of different variable payment terms.
Lease terms are negotiated and monitored by local management.
Variable payment terms are used for a variety of reasons, including minimising the fixed cost base for newly established stores or for reasons of margin control and operational flexibility.
Variable lease payment terms vary widely across the group
(a) the majority of variable payment terms are based on a range of percentages of store sales;
The overall financial effect of using variable payment terms is that higher rental costs are incurred by stores with higher sales.
This facilitates the management of margins across the group.
Lessee with a high volume of leases, that have a wide range of different terms and conditions, which are not managed centrally
Lessee concludes that information about how it manages the use of termination and extension options is the information that is relevant to users of its financial statements and is not available elsewhere in its financial statements.
Extension and termination options are included in a number of equipment leases across the group.
Local teams are responsible for managing their leases and, accordingly, lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.
Extension and termination options are included, when possible, to provide local management with greater flexibility to align its need for access to equipment with the fulfilment of customer contracts.
The individual terms and conditions used vary across the group.
The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by Lessee and not by the respective lessors.
In cases in which Lessee is not reasonably certain to use an optional extended lease term, payments associated with the optional period are not included within lease liabilities.
These leases are classified as short-term leases and are not included within lease liabilities.
Lessee has a central property team that negotiates leases.
Lessee concludes that information about termination options is relevant to users of its financial statements and is not available elsewhere in its financial statements.
This is similar to the information that is reported to Lessee's senior management about termination options.
These options are used to limit the period to which the group is committed to individual lease contracts and to maximise operational flexibility in terms of opening and closing individual restaurants.
For most leases of restaurants, recognised lease liabilities do not include potential future rental payments after the exercise date of termination options because Lessee is not reasonably certain to extend the lease beyond that date.
This is the case for most leases for which a longer lease period can be enforced only by Lessee and not by the landlord, and for which there is no penalty associated with the option.
Potential future rental payments relating to periods following the exercise date of termination options are summarised below.
Lessee's group policy is to use extension options to align, when possible, committed lease terms for large equipment with the initial contractual term of associated customer contracts, whilst retaining flexibility to manage its large equipment and reallocate assets across contracts.
Lessee concludes that information about extension options is relevant to users of its financial statements and is not available elsewhere in its financial statements.
This is similar to the information that is reported to Lessee's senior management about extension options.
These terms are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts.
These terms are not reflected in measuring lease liabilities in many cases because the options are not reasonably certain to be exercised.
This is generally the case when the underlying large equipment has not been allocated for use on a particular customer contract after the exercise date of an extension option.
The table below summarises potential future rental payments relating to periods following the exercise dates of extension options.
Potential future lease payments not included in lease liabilities (discounted)
Historical rate of exercise of extension options
Accordingly, Seller-lessee and Buyer-lessor account for the transaction as a sale and leaseback.
Because the consideration for the sale of the building is not at fair value, Seller-lessee and Buyer-lessor make adjustments to measure the sale proceeds at fair value.
At the commencement date, Seller-lessee accounts for the transaction as follows.
At the commencement date, Buyer-lessor accounts for the transaction as follows.
Amended paragraphs are shown with deleted text struck through and new text underlined.
In the Illustrative Examples, paragraph IE321 is amended.
(a) In these Illustrative Examples, currency amounts are denominated in 'currency units' (CU).
Conditions to receive such assistance may not be specifically related to the operating activities of the entity.
Examples of such assistance are transfers of resources by governments to entities which
operate in a particular industry;
start or continue to run their business in underdeveloped areas.
Such grants shall therefore not be credited directly to shareholders' interests.
The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment and disclosures related to agricultural activity.
biological assets, except for bearer plants;
While such processing may be a logical and natural extension of agricultural activity, and the events taking place may bear some similarity to biological transformation, such processing is not included within the definition of agricultural activity in this Standard.
Products that are the result of processing after harvest
Trees in a timber plantation
Agricultural activity is the management by an entity of the biological transformation and harvest of biological assets for sale or for conversion into agricultural produce or into additional biological assets.
Agricultural produce is the harvested produce of the entity's biological assets.
A bearer plant is a living plant that
is used in the production or supply of agricultural produce;
has a remote likelihood of being sold as agricultural produce, except for incidental scrap sales.
A biological asset is a living animal or plant.
Biological transformation comprises the processes of growth, degeneration, production, and procreation that cause qualitative or quantitative changes in a biological asset.
Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset, excluding finance costs and income taxes.
A group of biological assets is an aggregation of similar living animals or plants.
Harvest is the detachment of produce from a biological asset or the cessation of a biological asset's life processes.
The following are not bearer plants
plants cultivated to be harvested as agricultural produce (for example, trees grown for use as lumber);
plants cultivated to produce agricultural produce when there is more than a remote likelihood that the entity will also harvest and sell the plant as agricultural produce, other than as incidental scrap sales (for example, trees that are cultivated both for their fruit and their lumber); and
When bearer plants are no longer used to bear produce they might be cut down and sold as scrap, for example, for use as firewood.
Such incidental scrap sales would not prevent the plant from satisfying the definition of a bearer plant.
Produce growing on bearer plants is a biological asset.
Management facilitates biological transformation by enhancing, or at least stabilising, conditions necessary for the process to take place (for example, nutrient levels, moisture, temperature, fertility, and light).
Such management distinguishes agricultural activity from other activities.
production of agricultural produce such as latex, tea leaf, wool, and milk.
Carrying amount is the amount at which an asset is recognised in the statement of financial position.
the entity controls the asset as a result of past events;
the fair value or cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
The future benefits are normally assessed by measuring the significant physical attributes.
An entity selects the attributes corresponding to the attributes used in the market as a basis for pricing.
Contract prices are not necessarily relevant in measuring fair value, because fair value reflects the current market conditions in which market participant buyers and sellers would enter into a transaction.
As a result, the fair value of a biological asset or agricultural produce is not adjusted because of the existence of a contract.
There may be no separate market for biological assets that are attached to the land but an active market may exist for the combined assets, that is, for the biological assets, raw land, and land improvements, as a package.
An entity may use information regarding the combined assets to measure the fair value of the biological assets.
For example, the fair value of raw land and land improvements may be deducted from the fair value of the combined assets to arrive at the fair value of biological assets.
A gain may arise on initial recognition of a biological asset, such as when a calf is born.
However, that presumption can be rebutted only on initial recognition for a biological asset for which quoted market prices are not available and for which alternative fair value measurements are determined to be clearly unreliable.
In such a case, that biological asset shall be measured at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Once the fair value of such a biological asset becomes reliably measurable, an entity shall measure it at its fair value less costs to sell.
An entity that has previously measured a biological asset at its fair value less costs to sell continues to measure the biological asset at its fair value less costs to sell until disposal.
This Standard reflects the view that the fair value of agricultural produce at the point of harvest can always be measured reliably.
However, if the terms of the grant allow part of it to be retained according to the time that has elapsed, the entity recognises that part in profit or loss as time passes.
For example, an entity may disclose the carrying amounts of consumable biological assets and bearer biological assets by group.
An entity may further divide those carrying amounts between mature and immature assets.
These distinctions provide information that may be helpful in assessing the timing of future cash flows.
An entity discloses the basis for making any such distinctions.
Examples of consumable biological assets are livestock intended for the production of meat, livestock held for sale, fish in farms, crops such as maize and wheat, produce on a bearer plant and trees being grown for lumber.
Bearer biological assets are those other than consumable biological assets; for example, livestock from which milk is produced and fruit trees from which fruit is harvested.
Mature biological assets are those that have attained harvestable specifications (for consumable biological assets) or are able to sustain regular harvests (for bearer biological assets).
non-financial measures or estimates of the physical quantities of
each group of the entity's biological assets at the end of the period; and
output of agricultural produce during the period.
the existence and carrying amounts of biological assets whose title is restricted, and the carrying amounts of biological assets pledged as security for liabilities;
financial risk management strategies related to agricultural activity.
the gain or loss arising from changes in fair value less costs to sell;
increases resulting from business combinations;
In such cases, an entity is encouraged to disclose, by group or otherwise, the amount of change in fair value less costs to sell included in profit or loss due to physical changes and due to price changes.
Each of those physical changes has a direct relationship to future economic benefits.
Examples of such an event include an outbreak of a virulent disease, a flood, a severe drought or frost, and a plague of insects.
a description of the biological assets;
if possible, the range of estimates within which fair value is highly likely to lie;
the gross carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation (aggregated with accumulated impairment losses) at the beginning and end of the period.
In addition, the reconciliation shall include the following amounts included in profit or loss related to those biological assets
the nature and extent of government grants recognised in the financial statements;
significant decreases expected in the level of government grants.
If an entity applies the amendments for an earlier period it shall disclose that fact.
When to recognise a dividend payable
Measurement of a dividend payable
Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an entity settles the dividend payable
In those situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving either non-cash assets or a cash alternative.
The IFRIC received requests for guidance on how an entity should account for such distributions.
distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-cash assets or a cash alternative.
This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the distribution.
It does not address the accounting by shareholders who receive such a distribution.
Consequently, this Interpretation addresses the following issues
when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of directors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval.
the nature of the asset to be distributed;
uncertainty over income tax treatments
The acceptability of a particular tax treatment under tax law may not be known until the relevant taxation authority or a court takes a decision in the future.
Consequently, a dispute or examination of a particular tax treatment by the taxation authority may affect an entity's accounting for a current or deferred tax asset or liability.
tax treatments' refers to the treatments used by an entity or that it plans to use in its income tax filings.
taxation authority' refers to the body or bodies that decide whether tax treatments are acceptable under tax law.
This might include a court.
an 'uncertain tax treatment' is a tax treatment for which there is uncertainty over whether the relevant taxation authority will accept the tax treatment under tax law.
For example, an entity's decision not to submit any income tax filing in a tax jurisdiction, or not to include particular income in taxable profit, is an uncertain tax treatment if its acceptability is uncertain under tax law.
Whether an entity considers uncertain tax treatments separately
In determining the approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty, an entity might consider, for example, (a) how it prepares its income tax filings and supports tax treatments; or (b) how the entity expects the taxation authority to make its examination and resolve issues that might arise from that examination.
Determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates
the most likely amount — the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes.
the expected value — the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes.
Changes in facts and circumstances
For example, a change in facts and circumstances might change an entity's conclusions about the acceptability of a tax treatment or the entity's estimate of the effect of uncertainty, or both.
Paragraphs A1–A3 set out guidance on changes in facts and circumstances.
Examples of changes in facts and circumstances or new information that, depending on the circumstances, can result in the reassessment of a judgement or estimate required by this Interpretation include, but are not limited to, the following
examinations or actions by a taxation authority.
agreement or disagreement by the taxation authority with the tax treatment or a similar tax treatment used by the entity;
information that the taxation authority has agreed or disagreed with a similar tax treatment used by another entity; and
(iii) information about the amount received or paid to settle a similar tax treatment.
changes in rules established by a taxation authority.
the expiry of a taxation authority's right to examine or re-examine a tax treatment.
The absence of agreement or disagreement by a taxation authority with a tax treatment, in isolation, is unlikely to constitute a change in facts and circumstances or new information that affects the judgements and estimates required by this Interpretation.
When there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, an entity shall determine whether to disclose
On initial application, an entity shall apply this Interpretation either
retrospectively applying IAS 8, if that is possible without the use of hindsight; or
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the Interpretation recognised at the date of initial application.
If an entity selects this transition approach, it shall not restate comparative information.
Instead, the entity shall recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying the Interpretation as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate).
Cost of agricultural produce harvested from biological assets
A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the amount of cost to be recognised as an asset and carried forward until the related revenues are recognised.
This Standard provides guidance on the determination of cost and its subsequent recognition as an expense, including any write-down to net realisable value.
It also provides guidance on the cost formulas that are used to assign costs to inventories.
producers of agricultural and forest products, agricultural produce after harvest, and minerals and mineral products, to the extent that they are measured at net realisable value in accordance with well-established practices in those industries.
When such inventories are measured at net realisable value, changes in that value are recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change.
commodity broker-traders who measure their inventories at fair value less costs to sell.
When such inventories are measured at fair value less costs to sell, changes in fair value less costs to sell are recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change.
This occurs, for example, when agricultural crops have been harvested or minerals have been extracted and sale is assured under a forward contract or a government guarantee, or when an active market exists and there is a negligible risk of failure to sell.
These inventories are excluded from only the measurement requirements of this Standard.
The inventories referred to in paragraph 3(b) are principally acquired with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations in price or broker-traders' margin.
When these inventories are measured at fair value less costs to sell, they are excluded from only the measurement requirements of this Standard.
held for sale in the ordinary course of business;
in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production process or in the rendering of services.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Fair value reflects the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the same inventory in the principal (or most advantageous) market for that inventory would take place between market participants at the measurement date.
The former is an entity-specific value; the latter is not.
Net realisable value for inventories may not equal fair value less costs to sell.
Inventories also encompass finished goods produced, or work in progress being produced, by the entity and include materials and supplies awaiting use in the production process.
Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items are deducted in determining the costs of purchase.
They also include a systematic allocation of fixed and variable production overheads that are incurred in converting materials into finished goods.
Fixed production overheads are those indirect costs of production that remain relatively constant regardless of the volume of production, such as depreciation and maintenance of factory buildings, equipment and right-of-use assets used in the production process, and the cost of factory management and administration.
Variable production overheads are those indirect costs of production that vary directly, or nearly directly, with the volume of production, such as indirect materials and indirect labour.
The actual level of production may be used if it approximates normal capacity.
The amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is not increased as a consequence of low production or idle plant.
Unallocated overheads are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In periods of abnormally high production, the amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is decreased so that inventories are not measured above cost.
This is the case, for example, when joint products are produced or when there is a main product and a by-product.
When the costs of conversion of each product are not separately identifiable, they are allocated between the products on a rational and consistent basis.
The allocation may be based, for example, on the relative sales value of each product either at the stage in the production process when the products become separately identifiable, or at the completion of production.
Most by-products, by their nature, are immaterial.
When this is the case, they are often measured at net realisable value and this value is deducted from the cost of the main product.
As a result, the carrying amount of the main product is not materially different from its cost.
For example, it may be appropriate to include non-production overheads or the costs of designing products for specific customers in the cost of inventories.
storage costs, unless those costs are necessary in the production process before a further production stage;
This is the cost of the inventories at that date for application of this Standard.
Standard costs take into account normal levels of materials and supplies, labour, efficiency and capacity utilisation.
They are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, revised in the light of current conditions.
The cost of the inventory is determined by reducing the sales value of the inventory by the appropriate percentage gross margin.
The percentage used takes into consideration inventory that has been marked down to below its original selling price.
An average percentage for each retail department is often used.
This is the appropriate treatment for items that are segregated for a specific project, regardless of whether they have been bought or produced.
However, specific identification of costs is inappropriate when there are large numbers of items of inventory that are ordinarily interchangeable.
In such circumstances, the method of selecting those items that remain in inventories could be used to obtain predetermined effects on profit or loss.
An entity shall use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the entity.
For inventories with a different nature or use, different cost formulas may be justified.
However, a difference in geographical location of inventories (or in the respective tax rules), by itself, is not sufficient to justify the use of different cost formulas.
Under the weighted average cost formula, the cost of each item is determined from the weighted average of the cost of similar items at the beginning of a period and the cost of similar items purchased or produced during the period.
The average may be calculated on a periodic basis, or as each additional shipment is received, depending upon the circumstances of the entity.
The cost of inventories may also not be recoverable if the estimated costs of completion or the estimated costs to be incurred to make the sale have increased.
The practice of writing inventories down below cost to net realisable value is consistent with the view that assets should not be carried in excess of amounts expected to be realised from their sale or use.
In some circumstances, however, it may be appropriate to group similar or related items.
This may be the case with items of inventory relating to the same product line that have similar purposes or end uses, are produced and marketed in the same geographical area, and cannot be practicably evaluated separately from other items in that product line.
It is not appropriate to write inventories down on the basis of a classification of inventory, for example, finished goods, or all the inventories in a particular operating segment.
These estimates take into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after the end of the period to the extent that such events confirm conditions existing at the end of the period.
For example, the net realisable value of the quantity of inventory held to satisfy firm sales or service contracts is based on the contract price.
If the sales contracts are for less than the inventory quantities held, the net realisable value of the excess is based on general selling prices.
Provisions may arise from firm sales contracts in excess of inventory quantities held or from firm purchase contracts.
However, when a decline in the price of materials indicates that the cost of the finished products exceeds net realisable value, the materials are written down to net realisable value.
In such circumstances, the replacement cost of the materials may be the best available measure of their net realisable value.
This occurs, for example, when an item of inventory that is carried at net realisable value, because its selling price has declined, is still on hand in a subsequent period and its selling price has increased.
The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventories shall be recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs.
The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories, arising from an increase in net realisable value, shall be recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.
Inventories allocated to another asset in this way are recognised as an expense during the useful life of that asset.
the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories, including the cost formula used;
the total carrying amount of inventories and the carrying amount in classifications appropriate to the entity;
the carrying amount of inventories carried at fair value less costs to sell;
the amount of inventories recognised as an expense during the period;
the carrying amount of inventories pledged as security for liabilities.
Common classifications of inventories are merchandise, production supplies, materials, work in progress and finished goods.
The circumstances of the entity may also warrant the inclusion of other amounts, such as distribution costs.
Under this format, an entity presents an analysis of expenses using a classification based on the nature of expenses.
In this case, the entity discloses the costs recognised as an expense for raw materials and consumables, labour costs and other costs together with the amount of the net change in inventories for the period.
interim financial reporting and impairment
However, at the end of a subsequent reporting period, conditions may have so changed that the impairment loss would have been reduced or avoided had the impairment assessment been made only at that date.
This Interpretation provides guidance on whether such impairment losses should ever be reversed.
Should an entity reverse impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill if a loss would not have been recognised, or a smaller loss would have been recognised, had an impairment assessment been made only at the end of a subsequent reporting period?
rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds
Accounting for an interest in a fund
Accounting for obligations to make additional contributions
In such cases there is a potential mismatch in the amount of contributions made by a contributor (based on current activity) and the value realisable from the fund (based on past activity).
entities (contributors) make contributions to the fund, which are invested in a range of assets that may include both debt and equity investments, and are available to help pay the contributors' decommissioning costs.
The trustees determine how contributions are invested, within the constraints set by the fund's governing documents and any applicable legislation or other regulations.
the contributors retain the obligation to pay decommissioning costs.
However, contributors are able to obtain reimbursement of decommissioning costs from the fund up to the lower of the decommissioning costs incurred and the contributor's share of assets of the fund.
the contributors may have restricted access or no access to any surplus of assets of the fund over those used to meet eligible decommissioning costs.
If it does, the contributor shall account for its interest in the fund in accordance with those Standards.
This reimbursement shall be measured at the lower of
the contributor's share of the fair value of the net assets of the fund attributable to contributors.
Changes in the carrying value of the right to receive reimbursement other than contributions to and payments from the fund shall be recognised in profit or loss in the period in which these changes occur.
The contributor shall recognise a liability only if it is probable that additional contributions will be made.
PREPARATION OF SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
It applies when an entity prepares separate financial statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of a group in which the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent and its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity.
Preparation of separate financial statements
The entity shall apply the same accounting for each category of investments.
When a parent ceases to be an investment entity, or becomes an investment entity, it shall account for the change from the date when the change in status occurred, as follows
The date of the change of status shall be the deemed acquisition date.
The difference between the previous carrying amount of the subsidiary and its fair value at the date of the change of status of the investor shall be recognised as a gain or loss in profit or loss.
The cumulative amount of any gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of those subsidiaries shall be treated as if the investment entity had disposed of those subsidiaries at the date of change in status.
The dividend is recognised in profit or loss unless the entity elects to use the equity method, in which case the dividend is recognised as a reduction from the carrying amount of the investment.
the new parent obtains control of the original parent by issuing equity instruments in exchange for existing equity instruments of the original parent;
the owners of the original parent before the reorganisation have the same absolute and relative interests in the net assets of the original group and the new group immediately before and after the reorganisation
In such cases, references to 'original parent' and 'original group' are to the 'original entity'.
the fact that the financial statements are separate financial statements; that the exemption from consolidation has been used; the name and principal place of business (and country of incorporation, if different) of the entity whose consolidated financial statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards have been produced for public use; and the address where those consolidated financial statements are obtainable.

When an investment entity that is a parent (other than a parent covered by paragraph 16) prepares, in accordance with paragraph 8A, separate financial statements as its only financial statements, it shall disclose that fact.
The parent or investor shall also disclose in its separate financial statements
the fact that the statements are separate financial statements and the reasons why those statements are prepared if not required by law.
If an entity applies those amendments earlier, it shall disclose that fact and apply all amendments included in Investment Entities at the same time.
At the date of initial application, an investment entity that previously measured its investment in a subsidiary at cost shall instead measure that investment at fair value through profit or loss as if the requirements of this IFRS had always been effective.
the fair value of the investor's investment in the subsidiary.
At the date of initial application, an investment entity that previously measured its investment in a subsidiary at fair value through other comprehensive income shall continue to measure that investment at fair value.
When the date that it is practicable for the investment entity to measure the fair value of the subsidiary is earlier than the beginning of the immediately preceding period, the investor shall adjust equity at the beginning of the immediately preceding period for any difference between
If the earliest period for which application of this paragraph is practicable is the current period, the adjustment to equity shall be recognised at the beginning of the current period.
If an investment entity has disposed of, or lost control of, an investment in a subsidiary before the date of initial application of the Investment Entities amendments, the investment entity is not required to make adjustments to the previous accounting for that investment.
If an entity presents unadjusted comparative information for any earlier periods, it shall clearly identify the information that has not been adjusted, state that it has been prepared on a different basis, and explain that basis.
investments in associates and joint ventures
APPLICATION OF THE EQUITY METHOD
Exemptions from applying the equity method
Classification as held for sale
Discontinuing the use of the equity method
An associate is an entity over which the investor has significant influence.
Consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of a group in which assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent and its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity.
The equity method is a method of accounting whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the investor's share of the investee's net assets.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
A joint venturer is a party to a joint venture that has joint control of that joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those policies.
A substantial or majority ownership by another investor does not necessarily preclude an entity from having significant influence.
representation on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee;
participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other distributions;
material transactions between the entity and its investee;
interchange of managerial personnel; or
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible, including potential voting rights held by other entities, are considered when assessing whether an entity has significant influence.
Potential voting rights are not currently exercisable or convertible when, for example, they cannot be exercised or converted until a future date or until the occurrence of a future event.
The loss of significant influence can occur with or without a change in absolute or relative ownership levels.
It could occur, for example, when an associate becomes subject to the control of a government, court, administrator or regulator.
It could also occur as a result of a contractual arrangement.
The investor's share of the investee's profit or loss is recognised in the investor's profit or loss.
Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.
Adjustments to the carrying amount may also be necessary for changes in the investor's proportionate interest in the investee arising from changes in the investee's other comprehensive income.
Such changes include those arising from the revaluation of property, plant and equipment and from foreign exchange translation differences.
Because the investor has joint control of, or significant influence over, the investee, the investor has an interest in the associate's or joint venture's performance and, as a result, the return on its investment.
The investor accounts for this interest by extending the scope of its financial statements to include its share of the profit or loss of such an investee.
As a result, application of the equity method provides more informative reporting of the investor's net assets and profit or loss.
In such circumstances, the proportion allocated to the entity is determined by taking into account the eventual exercise of those potential voting rights and other derivative instruments that currently give the entity access to the returns.
In applying IFRS 9, the entity does not take account of any adjustments to the carrying amount of long-term interests that arise from applying this Standard.
Application of the equity method
If the entity makes that election, the entity shall apply the equity method to any remaining portion of its investment in an associate that is not held through a venture capital organisation, or a mutual fund, unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked insurance funds.
Any retained portion of an investment in an associate or a joint venture that has not been classified as held for sale shall be accounted for using the equity method until disposal of the portion that is classified as held for sale takes place.
Financial statements for the periods since classification as held for sale shall be amended accordingly.
the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate or joint venture; and
the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity method was discontinued.
For example, if an associate or a joint venture has cumulative exchange differences relating to a foreign operation and the entity discontinues the use of the equity method, the entity shall reclassify to profit or loss the gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the foreign operation.
Furthermore, the concepts underlying the procedures used in accounting for the acquisition of a subsidiary are also adopted in accounting for the acquisition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture.
The holdings of the group's other associates or joint ventures are ignored for this purpose.
Upstream' transactions are, for example, sales of assets from an associate or a joint venture to the investor.
Downstream' transactions are, for example, sales or contributions of assets from the investor to its associate or its joint venture.
The investor's share in the associate's or joint venture's gains or losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated.
When upstream transactions provide evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of the assets to be purchased or of an impairment loss of those assets, the investor shall recognise its share in those losses.
Such unrealised gains and losses shall be eliminated against the investment accounted for using the equity method and shall not be presented as deferred gains or losses in the entity's consolidated statement of financial position or in the entity's statement of financial position in which investments are accounted for using the equity method.
On acquisition of the investment, any difference between the cost of the investment and the entity's share of the net fair value of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted for as follows
Amortisation of that goodwill is not permitted.
Appropriate adjustments to the entity's share of the associate's or joint venture's profit or loss after acquisition are made in order to account, for example, for depreciation of the depreciable assets based on their fair values at the acquisition date.
Similarly, appropriate adjustments to the entity's share of the associate's or joint venture's profit or loss after acquisition are made for impairment losses such as for goodwill or property, plant and equipment.
When the end of the reporting period of the entity is different from that of the associate or joint venture, the associate or joint venture prepares, for the use of the entity, financial statements as of the same date as the financial statements of the entity unless it is impracticable to do so.
The length of the reporting periods and any difference between the ends of the reporting periods shall be the same from period to period.
The interest in an associate or a joint venture is the carrying amount of the investment in the associate or joint venture determined using the equity method together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity's net investment in the associate or joint venture.
For example, an item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, an extension of the entity's investment in that associate or joint venture.
Such items may include preference shares and long-term receivables or loans, but do not include trade receivables, trade payables or any long-term receivables for which adequate collateral exists, such as secured loans.
Losses recognised using the equity method in excess of the entity's investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the entity's interest in an associate or a joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority (ie priority in liquidation).
If the associate or joint venture subsequently reports profits, the entity resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
Losses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised.
Objective evidence that the net investment is impaired includes observable data that comes to the attention of the entity about the following loss events
significant financial difficulty of the associate or joint venture;
a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in payments by the associate or joint venture;
the entity, for economic or legal reasons relating to its associate's or joint venture's financial difficulty, granting to the associate or joint venture a concession that the entity would not otherwise consider;
it becoming probable that the associate or joint venture will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
the disappearance of an active market for the net investment because of financial difficulties of the associate or joint venture.
The disappearance of an active market because the associate's or joint venture's equity or financial instruments are no longer publicly traded is not evidence of impairment.
A downgrade of an associate's or joint venture's credit rating or a decline in the fair value of the associate or joint venture, is not of itself, evidence of impairment, although it may be evidence of impairment when considered with other available information.
A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument below its cost is also objective evidence of impairment.
An impairment loss recognised in those circumstances is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the net investment in the associate or joint venture.
In determining the value in use of the net investment, an entity estimates
the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from dividends to be received from the investment and from its ultimate disposal.
Using appropriate assumptions, both methods give the same result.
If an entity applies that amendment for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact.
The entity is not required to restate prior periods to reflect the application of the amendments.
If an entity does not restate prior periods applying paragraph 45I or paragraph 45J, at the date of initial application of the amendments it shall recognise in the opening retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) any difference between
the previous carrying amount of long-term interests described in paragraph 14A at that date; and
the carrying amount of those long-term interests at that date.

Summary of main changes from the Exposure Draft Fair Value Option for Financial Liabilities
That Basis for Conclusions was subsequently updated to reflect amendments to the Standard.
In those paragraphs cross-references to the Standard have been updated accordingly and minor necessary editorial changes have been made.
Those dissenting opinions are set out in an appendix after this Basis for Conclusions.
Individual IASB members gave greater weight to some factors than to others.
BCIN.2 The IASB has long acknowledged the need to improve the requirements for financial reporting of financial instruments to enhance the relevance and understandability of information about financial instruments for users of financial statements.
To do this the IASB divided the project into several phases.
In adopting this approach, the IASB acknowledged the difficulties that might be created by differences in timing between this project and others, in particular the project on insurance contracts.
However, some respondents said that the IASB should finalise its proposals on the classification and measurement of financial assets while retaining the existing requirements for financial liabilities (including the requirements for embedded derivatives and the fair value option) until the IASB had more fully considered the issues relating to financial liabilities.
Those respondents pointed out that the IASB had accelerated its project on financial instruments because of the global financial crisis, which had placed more emphasis on issues in the accounting for financial assets than for financial liabilities.
They suggested that the IASB should consider issues related to financial liabilities more closely before finalising the requirements for classification and measurement of financial liabilities.
In the IASB's view, requirements for classification and measurement are the foundation for a financial reporting standard on accounting for financial instruments, and the requirements on associated matters (for example, on impairment and hedge accounting) have to reflect those requirements.
Taking that course enabled the IASB to obtain further feedback on the accounting for financial liabilities, including how best to address accounting for changes in own credit risk.
BCIN.7 Immediately after issuing IFRS 9, the IASB began an extensive outreach programme to gather feedback on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.
considering the interaction between the classification and measurement of financial assets and the accounting for insurance contract liabilities;
seeking to reduce key differences with the US national standard-setter, the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) tentative classification and measurement model for financial instruments.
However, many asked the IASB for clarifications or additional guidance on particular aspects of the proposals.
Amortised cost and impairment methodology
The FCAG considered how improvements in financial reporting could help to enhance investor confidence in financial markets.
Those weaknesses included the delayed recognition of credit losses on loans (and other financial instruments) and the complexity of multiple impairment approaches.
BCIN.14 The IASB started developing an impairment model that would reflect the general pattern of deterioration in the credit quality of financial instruments and in which the amount of the expected credit losses recognised as a loss allowance or provision would depend on the level of deterioration in the credit quality of financial instruments since initial recognition.
That Exposure Draft contained an objective for hedge accounting that aimed to align accounting more closely with risk management and to provide useful information about the purpose and effect of hedging instruments.
It also proposed requirements for
what financial instruments qualify for designation as hedging instruments;
what items (existing or expected) qualify for designation as hedged items;
an objective-based hedge effectiveness assessment;
hedge accounting presentation and disclosures.
The IASB obtained information and views from users of financial statements, preparers, treasurers, risk management experts, auditors, standard-setters and regulators from a range of industries across different geographical regions.
The IASB received strong support for the objective of aligning accounting more closely with risk management.
It has been changed only as a consequence of other new requirements, such as to reflect the changes to the accounting for expected credit losses on loan commitments that an entity issues (see paragraph BC2.8).
This question arises because a commitment to make a loan at a specified rate of interest during a fixed period of time meets the definition of a derivative.
In effect, it is a written option for the potential borrower to obtain a loan at a specified rate.
The effect of the exclusion is that an entity will not recognise and measure changes in fair value of these loan commitments that result from changes in market interest rates or credit spreads.
This may be appropriate, for example, if the entity manages risk exposures related to loan commitments on a fair value basis.
The IASB considered this concern and agreed that the words in that Exposure Draft did not reflect the IASB's intention.
The IASB did not change the accounting for loan commitments held by potential borrowers.
However, although this difference in legal form may in some cases reflect differences in substance, the accounting for these instruments should not depend on their legal form.
If a financial guarantee contract was issued in a stand-alone arm's length transaction to an unrelated party, its fair value at inception is likely to equal the premium received, unless there is evidence to the contrary.
Before reviewing the comment letters, the IASB held a public education session at which it received briefings from representatives of the International Credit Insurance & Surety Association and of the Association of Financial Guaranty Insurers.
They argued that the Exposure Draft did not give enough guidance to enable them to account for these features.
The IASB concluded it could not address such features in the short term.
The IASB noted that when credit insurers issue credit insurance contracts, they typically recognise a liability measured as either the premium received or an estimate of the expected losses.
However, the IASB was concerned that some other issuers of financial guarantee contracts might argue that no recognisable liability existed at inception.
To provide a temporary solution that balances these competing concerns, the IASB decided the following
However, the IASB could not find a more compelling approach to resolve its concerns for the short term.
Moreover, although the criteria described in paragraph BCZ2.12(a) may appear imprecise, the IASB believes that the criteria would provide a clear answer in the vast majority of cases.
They argued that the requirement to recognise these financial guarantee contracts in separate or individual financial statements would cause costs disproportionate to the likely benefits, given that intragroup transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
However, to avoid the omission of material liabilities from separate or individual financial statements, the IASB did not create such an exemption.
However, any differences are reflected only in the separate or individual financial statements of the parent, subsidiaries or common control entities.
However, this was beyond the limited scope of the project.
The IASB concluded that the amendments should make them consistent on the basis of the notion that a contract to buy or sell a non-financial item should be accounted for as a derivative when it (i) can be settled net or by exchanging financial instruments and (ii) is not held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the non-financial item in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (a 'normal' purchase or sale).
In addition, the IASB concluded that the notion of when a contract can be settled net should include contracts
where the entity has a practice of settling similar contracts net in cash or another financial instrument or by exchanging financial instruments;
for which the entity has a practice of taking delivery of the underlying and selling it within a short period after delivery for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer's margin; and
in which the non-financial item that is the subject of the contract is readily convertible to cash.
The IASB also decided to clarify that a written option that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, is within the scope of the Standard and cannot qualify as a 'normal' purchase or sale.
As part of those deliberations, the IASB considered the accounting for executory contracts that gives rise to accounting mismatches in some situations.
The IASB's decision is discussed in more detail below.
For example, a contract is considered to be settleable net in cash even if it is not explicit in the terms of the contract, but the entity has a practice of settling similar contracts net in cash.
Many commodity contracts meet the criteria for net settlement in cash because in many instances commodities are readily convertible to cash.
When such a contract is accounted for as a derivative, it is measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognised in profit or loss.
If an entity enters into a derivative to hedge the change in the fair value of the commodity contract, that derivative is also measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
Because the changes in the fair value of the commodity contract and the derivative are recognised in profit or loss, an entity does not need hedge accounting.
Consequently, if an entity enters into a derivative contract to hedge changes in the fair value arising from a commodity supply contract that is not within the scope of IAS 39, an accounting mismatch is created.
This is because the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in profit or loss while the change in the fair value of the commodity supply contract is not recognised (unless the contract is onerous).
BCZ2.24 To eliminate this accounting mismatch, an entity could apply hedge accounting.
Consequently, the commodity supply contracts would be measured at fair value and the fair value changes would offset the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments (to the extent that those are effective hedges).
However, hedge accounting in these circumstances is administratively burdensome and often produces a less meaningful result than fair value accounting.
Furthermore, entities enter into large volumes of commodity contracts and some positions may offset each other.
An entity would therefore typically hedge on a net basis.
Moreover, in many business models, this net position also includes physical long positions such as commodity inventory.
That net position as a whole is then managed using derivatives to achieve a net position (after hedging) of nil (or close to nil).
Because of the frequent movement of the net position and therefore the frequent adjustment of the net position to nil or close to nil by using derivatives, an entity would have to adjust the fair value hedge relationships frequently if the entity were to apply hedge accounting.
allowing an entity to elect to account for commodity contracts as derivatives (ie a free choice); or
accounting for a commodity contract as a derivative if that is in accordance with the entity's fair value-based risk management strategy.
BCZ2.26 The IASB noted that giving an entity the choice to account for commodity contracts as derivatives would be tantamount to an elective 'own use' scope exception, which would have outcomes that would be similar to the accounting treatment in US GAAP.
Once the entity had elected to apply the scope exception it would not be able to change its election and switch to derivative accounting.
This is different from a free choice, which would allow, but not require, the accounting treatment to reflect the purpose of the contract.
Hence, a free choice would allow an entity to account for a commodity contract as a derivative regardless of whether similar contracts have been settled net in cash.
Consequently, the actual type of settlement (ie whether settled net in cash) would not be conclusive for the evaluation of the appropriate accounting treatment.
Instead, an entity would consider not only the purpose (based solely on the actual type of settlement) but also how the contracts are managed.
As a result, if an entity's underlying business model changes and the entity no longer manages its commodity contracts on a fair value basis, the contracts would revert to the own use scope exception.
This would be consistent with the criteria for using the fair value option for financial instruments (ie eliminating an accounting mismatch or if the financial instruments are managed on a fair value basis).
BCZ2.29 Consequently, the IASB proposed that derivative accounting would apply to contracts that would otherwise meet the own use scope exception if that is in accordance with the entity's fair value-based risk management strategy.
The IASB believed that this approach would faithfully represent the financial position and the performance of entities that manage their entire business on a fair value basis, provide more useful information to users of financial statements, and be less onerous for entities than applying hedge accounting.
Those who supported the proposal thought that it would facilitate a better presentation of the overall economic effects of entering into such hedging transactions.
They argued that in scenarios in which there are other items that are managed within a fair value-based risk management strategy and those other items are not measured at fair value under IFRS, applying derivative accounting to 'own use contracts' would introduce (instead of eliminate) an accounting mismatch.
For example, in the electricity industry the risk management for some power plants and the related electricity sales is on a fair value basis.
If these entities had to apply derivative accounting for customer sales contracts it would create an accounting mismatch.
Another example raised by respondents was that of entities risk-managing the own use contracts, inventory and derivatives on a fair value basis.
BCZ2.32 Some respondents also requested that the IASB remove the precondition that an entity achieves a nil or close to nil net risk position in order to qualify for accounting for executory contracts as derivatives.
These respondents noted that, from an entity's perspective, whether it takes a position or manages its exposure close to nil, it is still employing a fair value-based risk management strategy and that the financial statements should reflect the nature of its risk management activities.
BCZ2.33 Some also requested that the IASB clarify whether the proposal required that a fair value-based risk management strategy is adopted at an entity level or whether the business model can be assessed at a level lower than the entity level.
These respondents commented that within an entity, a part of the business may be risk-managed on a fair value basis while other businesses within the entity may be managed differently.
it is consistent with the IASB's objective to represent more faithfully the financial position and performance of entities that risk-manage an entire business on a fair value basis;
it provides operational relief for entities that risk-manage an entire business on a dynamic fair value basis (ie it is less onerous than applying hedge accounting); and
it does not have the unintended consequences of creating an accounting mismatch in some situations.
Without those, the amendment would, by default, apply retrospectively.
The IASB decided that that option would apply on an 'all-or-none basis' for all similar contracts in order to prevent selective use of this option for similar contracts.
Consequently, restating comparatives would be impracticable because it would involve hindsight.
Paragraph 2(g) applies only when completion of the business combination is not dependent on further actions of either party (and only the passage of a normal period of time is required).
This should not be taken to imply that the principles for business combinations and consolidations can be applied by analogy to accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures.
The IASB concluded that paragraph 2(g) should not be applied by analogy to contracts to acquire investments in associates and similar transactions.
BCZ2.43 Some respondents to the Exposure Draft that proposed the amendment raised concerns about the proposed transition requirement.
The IASB noted that determining the fair value of a currently outstanding contract when its inception was before the effective date of this amendment would require the use of hindsight and might not achieve comparability.
Accordingly, the IASB decided not to require retrospective application.
The IASB also rejected applying the amendment prospectively only to new contracts entered into after the effective date because that would create a lack of comparability between contracts outstanding as of the effective date and contracts entered into after the effective date.
Recognition and derecognition (Chapter 3)
It was not always clear when and in what order to apply those concepts.
Also, some questioned whether the assessment should focus on risks and rewards or only risks and how different risks and rewards should be aggregated and weighed.
In this case, should (a) the entire portfolio continue to be recognised, (b) the portion that is guaranteed continue to be recognised or (c) the portfolio be derecognised in full and a guarantee be recognised as a financial liability?
However, there was limited support for the proposed continuing involvement approach.
Respondents expressed conceptual and practical concerns, including
any benefits of the proposed changes did not outweigh the burden of adopting a different approach that had its own set of (as yet unidentified and unsolved) problems;
the proposal did not achieve convergence with US GAAP;
the proposal was untested; and
the proposal was not consistent with the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.
In particular, the IASB decided that an evaluation of the transfer of risks and rewards should precede an evaluation of the transfer of control for all types of transactions.
BCZ3.10 The IASB also decided to include guidance in the Standard that clarified how to evaluate the concepts of risks and rewards and of control.
Although judgement was still necessary to apply the concepts in practice, the guidance was expected to increase consistency in how the concepts were applied.
BCZ3.11 More specifically, the IASB decided that the transfer of risks and rewards should be evaluated by comparing the entity's exposure before and after the transfer to the variability in the amounts and timing of the net cash flows of the transferred asset.
If the entity's exposure, on a present value basis, had not changed significantly, the entity would conclude that it had retained substantially all risks and rewards.
In this case, the IASB concluded that the asset should continue to be recognised.
BCZ3.12 The IASB decided that control should be evaluated by looking to whether the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset.
If the transferee could sell the asset (eg because the asset was readily obtainable in the market and the transferee could obtain a replacement asset if it needed to return the asset to the transferor), the transferor had not retained control because the transferor did not control the transferee's use of the asset.
If the transferee could not sell the asset (eg because the transferor had a call option and the asset was not readily obtainable in the market, so that the transferee could not obtain a replacement asset), the transferor had retained control because the transferee was not free to use the asset as its own.
The IASB decided to include such guidance in the Standard to clarify the issue (this guidance is now in IFRS 9).
It decided that an entity should apply the derecognition principles to a part of a financial asset only if that part contained no risks and rewards relating to the part not being considered for derecognition.
Accordingly, a part of a financial asset would be considered for derecognition only if it comprised
only specifically identified cash flows from a financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets);
only a fully proportionate (pro rata) share of the cash flows from a financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets); or
only a fully proportionate (pro rata) share of specifically identified cash flows from a financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets).
In all other cases the derecognition principles would be applied to the financial asset in its entirety.
Questions were raised in practice about the appropriate accounting treatment and divergent interpretations evolved for more complex structures.
In these cases, the entity acts more as an agent of the eventual recipients of the cash flows than as an owner of the asset.
Accordingly, to the extent that those conditions are met the arrangement is treated as a transfer and considered for derecognition even though the entity may continue to collect cash flows from the asset.
Conversely, to the extent the conditions are not met, the entity acts more as an owner of the asset with the result that the asset should continue to be recognised.
Some respondents asked for further clarification of the requirements and the interaction with the requirements for consolidation of special purpose entities (in SIC-12 Consolidation — Special Purpose Entities).
Respondents in the securitisation industry noted that under the proposed guidance many securitisation structures would not qualify for derecognition.
However, the entity is allowed to make short-term advances to the eventual recipient so long as it has the right of full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued interest.
In addition, during the short settlement period, the entity is not entitled to reinvest such cash flows except for investments in cash or cash equivalents and where any interest earned from such investments is remitted to the eventual recipients.
BCZ3.20 These conditions followed from the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Framework.
Condition (a) indicates that the transferor has no liability (because there is no present obligation to pay cash), and conditions (b) and (c) indicate that the transferor has no asset (because the transferor does not control the future economic benefits associated with the transferred asset).
This ensures consistency in the application of the derecognition model, whether a transaction is structured as a transfer of the contractual right to receive the cash flows of a financial asset or as an arrangement to pass through cash flows.
The amendments included such guidance (that guidance is now in IFRS 9).
To ensure that the accounting reflects the rights and obligations that the transferor has in relation to the transferred asset, there is a need to consider the accounting for the asset as well as the accounting for the associated liability.
Consequently, the asset continues to be recognised in its entirety and the proceeds received are recognised as a liability.
Similarly, the entity continues to recognise any income from the asset along with any expense incurred on the associated liability.
BCZ3.27 The IASB decided that if the entity determines that it has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of an asset and that it has retained control, the entity should continue to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.
This is to reflect the transferor's continuing exposure to the risks and rewards of the asset and that this exposure is not related to the entire asset, but is limited in amount.
The IASB noted that precluding derecognition to the extent of the continuing involvement is useful to users of financial statements in such cases, because it reflects the entity's retained exposure to the risks and rewards of the financial asset better than full derecognition.
BCZ3.29 For example, special measurement and income recognition issues arise if derecognition is precluded because the transferor has retained a call option or written a put option and the asset is measured at fair value.
In those situations, in the absence of additional guidance, application of the general measurement and income recognition requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities may result in accounting that does not represent the transferor's rights and obligations related to the transfer.
In addition to the round tables, the IASB undertook an extensive outreach programme with users, preparers, regulators, auditors, trade associations and others.
The boards also decided to conduct additional research and analysis, including a post-implementation review of the FASB's recently amended requirements, as a basis for assessing the nature and direction of any further efforts to improve or align IFRS and US GAAP.
Exemption for repurchased financial liabilities
an exchange between an existing borrower and lender of debt instruments with substantially different terms; or
a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability or a part of it.
The clarification aligns with the objective of the test, which is to quantitatively assess the significance of any difference between the old and new contractual terms on the basis of the changes in the contractual cash flows between the borrower and lender.
BC3.35 The transition requirements in paragraph 7.2.35 reflect the Board's view that the expected benefit from retrospective application of the amendment would not outweigh the cost of requiring entities to reassess all previous modifications and exchanges.
In particular, retrospective application would be unlikely to provide users of financial statements with trend information because financial liabilities are generally modified or exchanged on an ad hoc basis.
reducing the number of classification categories and providing a clearer rationale for measuring financial assets in a particular way that replaces the numerous categories in IAS 39, each of which has specific rules dictating how an asset can or must be classified;
aligning the measurement attribute of financial assets with the way the entity manages its financial assets ('business model') and their contractual cash flow characteristics, thus providing relevant and useful information to users for their assessment of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of the entity's future cash flows.
The IASB believes that these changes will help users to understand the financial reporting of financial assets and to better assess the amounts, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows.
Measurement categories for financial assets
Some users say that they often value an entity on the basis of its business model and that in some circumstances cost-based information provides relevant information that can be used to predict likely actual cash flows.
Those views were consistent with the general concerns raised during the financial crisis.
BC4.6 In response to those views, the IASB decided that measuring all financial assets at fair value is not the most appropriate approach to improving the financial reporting for financial instruments.
The IASB noted that both of those measurement methods can provide useful information to users of financial statements for particular types of financial assets in particular circumstances.
Some respondents said that fair value does not provide such information because it assumes that the financial asset is sold or transferred on the measurement date.
Fair value information in the statements of financial position and financial performance
Some of those supporting such presentation said that the information provided would be more reliable and timely if it were required to be presented in the statement of financial position instead of in the notes.
Those supporting such presentation said that its prominence would draw attention to how much of the total fair value gain or loss for the period was attributable to fair value measurements that are subject to more measurement uncertainty.
BC4.11 The IASB decided that it would reconsider both issues at a future date.
Approach to classifying financial assets
the financial asset has only basic loan features; and
the financial asset is managed on a contractual yield basis.
A financial asset that did not meet both conditions would be measured at fair value.
how the 'managed on a contractual yield basis' condition should be applied; and
how the 'basic loan features' condition should be applied.
However, the IASB noted that the contractual cash flow characteristics of any financial asset within a business model that has the objective of collecting contractual cash flows must also be assessed to ensure that amortised cost provides relevant information to users.
BC4.15 The IASB concluded that an entity's business model affects the predictive quality of contractual cash flows — ie whether the likely actual cash flows will result primarily from the collection of contractual cash flows.
This condition was intended to ensure that the measurement of a financial asset provides information that is useful to users of financial statements in predicting likely actual cash flows.
BC4.16 Almost all respondents to the exposure draft agreed that classification and measurement should reflect how an entity manages its financial assets.
However, most expressed concern that the term 'managed on a contractual yield basis' would not adequately describe that principle and that more guidance was needed.
Under that approach, financial instruments would be measured at fair value through profit or loss unless
The FASB also provided explanatory text
BC4.18 The IASB had intended 'managed on a contractual yield basis' to describe a similar condition.
However, it decided not to use the FASB's proposed guidance because the additional guidance included would still necessitate significant judgement.
In addition, the IASB noted that the FASB's proposed approach might be viewed as very similar to the notion of 'held to maturity' in IAS 39, which could result in 'bright line' guidance on how to apply it.
Most respondents believed the IASB should avoid such bright lines and that an entity should be required to exercise judgement.
BC4.19 Therefore, in response to the concerns noted in paragraph BC4.16, the IASB clarified the condition by requiring an entity to measure a financial asset at amortised cost only if the objective of the entity's business model is to hold the financial asset to collect the contractual cash flows.
The IASB also clarified in the application guidance that
it is expected that an entity may sell some financial assets that it holds with an objective of collecting the contractual cash flows.
Very few business models entail holding all instruments until maturity.
However, frequent buying and selling of financial assets is not consistent with a business model of holding financial assets to collect contractual cash flows.
an entity needs to use judgement to determine at what level this condition should be applied.
Consequently, a business model is very different from 'management intentions', which can relate to a single instrument.
The IASB concluded that sales or transfers of financial instruments before maturity would not be inconsistent with a business model with an objective of collecting contractual cash flows, as long as such transactions were consistent with that business model; instead of with a business model that has the objective of realising changes in fair values.
It specified that a financial instrument has basic loan features if its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
For the purposes of this condition, interest is consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time, which may include a premium for liquidity risk.
Cash flows that are interest always have a close relation to the amount advanced to the debtor (the 'funded' amount) because interest is consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk associated with the issuer of the instrument and with the instrument itself.
The IASB noted that the effective interest method is not an appropriate method to allocate cash flows that are not principal or interest on the principal amount outstanding.
The IASB concluded that if a financial asset contains contractual cash flows that are not principal or interest on the principal amount outstanding then a valuation overlay to contractual cash flows (fair value) is required to ensure that the reported financial information provides useful information.
However, many objected to the label 'basic loan features' and requested more guidance to apply the principle to particular financial assets.
It decided not to add application guidance clarifying that the notion of materiality applies to this condition, because that notion applies to every item in the financial statements.
However, it did add application guidance that a contractual cash flow characteristic does not affect the classification of a financial asset if it is 'not genuine'.
BC4.26 A structured investment vehicle may issue different tranches to create a 'waterfall' structure that prioritises the payments by the issuer to the holders of the different tranches.
In typical waterfall structures, multiple contractually linked instruments effect concentrations of credit risk in which payments to holders are prioritised.
Such structures specify the order in which any losses that the issuer incurs are allocated to the tranches.
Hence their cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Thus, only the most senior tranche could have basic loan features and might qualify for measurement at amortised cost, because only the most senior tranche would receive credit protection in all situations.
In the IASB's view, a contract that contains credit concentration features that create ongoing subordination (not only in a liquidation scenario) would include contractual cash flows that represent a premium for providing credit protection to other tranches.
Only the most senior tranche does not receive such a premium.
The ranking of an entity's instruments is a common form of subordination that affects almost all lending transactions.
Although it is often difficult to determine exactly the degree of leverage resulting from this subordination, the IASB believes that it is reasonable to assume that commercial law does not intend to create leveraged credit exposure for general creditors such as trade creditors.
Thus, the IASB believes that the credit risk associated with general creditors does not preclude the contractual cash flows representing the payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Consequently, the credit risk associated with any secured or senior liabilities ranking above general creditors should also not preclude the contractual cash flows from representing payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
In the IASB's view, those proposals were consistent with many respondents' view that any financial instrument that creates contractual subordination should be subject to the proposed classification criteria and no specific guidance should be required to apply the classification approach to these instruments.
However, it noted that, for contractually linked instruments that effect concentrations of credit risk, many respondents did not agree that the contractual cash flow characteristics determined by the terms and conditions of the financial asset in isolation best reflected the economic characteristics of that financial asset.
They made the following points
In particular, in order to obtain an understanding of the effects of the contractual terms and conditions, an investor would have to understand the underlying pool of instruments.
Also, requiring fair value measurement if it were not practicable to look through to the underlying pool of instruments would allow an entity to avoid such complexity.
Some also suggested that instruments that change the cash flow variability of the underlying pool of instruments in a way that is consistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, or aligned currency / interest rates with the issued notes, should not preclude amortised cost measurement.
Consequently, the IASB decided that, unless it is impracticable, an entity should 'look through' to assess the underlying cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and to assess the exposure to credit risk of those financial assets relative to the underlying pool of instruments.
Thus, if the contractual cash flows of the assets in the underlying pool represent payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, any tranche that is exposed to the same or lower credit risk (as evidenced by the cash flow variability of the tranche relative to the overall cash flow variability of the underlying instrument pool) would also be deemed to represent payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
The IASB also took the view that such an approach would address many of the concerns raised in the comment letters with regard to structuring opportunities and the focus on the contractual form of the financial asset, instead of its underlying economic characteristics.
The IASB also noted that in order to understand and make the judgement about whether particular types of financial assets have the required cash flow characteristics, an entity would have to understand the characteristics of the underlying issuer to ensure that the instrument's cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
BC4.35 To apply this approach, the IASB decided that an entity should
determine whether the contractual terms of the issued instrument (the financial asset being classified) give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
The IASB concluded that the issued instrument must have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
look through to the underlying pool of instruments until it can identify the instruments that are creating (instead of simply passing through) the cash flows.
assess whether any other instruments in the underlying pool only
reduce the cash flow variability of the underlying pool of instruments in a way that is consistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, or
align the cash flows of the issued financial assets with the underlying pool of financial instruments.
The IASB concluded that the existence of such instruments does not preclude the cash flows from representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
The IASB determined that the existence of other instruments in the pool would, however, preclude the cash flows representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. For example, an underlying pool that contains government bonds and an instrument that swaps government credit risk for (riskier) corporate credit risk would not have cash flows that represent solely principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
measure at fair value any issued instrument in which any of the financial instruments in the underlying pool
have cash flows that do not represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding; or
could change so that cash flows may not represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding at any point in the future.
measure at fair value any issued instrument whose exposure to credit risk in the underlying pool of financial instruments is greater than the exposure to credit risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments.
The IASB decided that if the range of expected losses on the issued instrument is greater than the weighted average range of expected losses on the underlying pool of financial instruments, then the issued instrument should be measured at fair value.
BC4.36 The IASB also decided that if it were not practicable to look through to the underlying pool of financial instruments, entities should measure the issued instrument at fair value.
Financial assets acquired at a discount that reflects incurred credit losses
the entity does not hold such financial assets to collect the cash flows arising from those assets' contractual terms; and
an investor acquiring a financial asset at such a discount believes that the actual losses will be less than the losses that are reflected in the purchase price.
Thus, that asset creates exposure to significant variability in actual cash flows and such variability is not interest.
They regarded that conclusion as an exception to a classification approach based on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets.
In particular, they noted that entities could acquire and subsequently manage such assets as part of an otherwise performing asset portfolio for which the objective of the entity's business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.
BC4.39 Respondents also noted that an entity's expectations about actual future cash flows are not the same as the contractual cash flows of the financial asset. Those expectations are irrelevant to an assessment of the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics.
Thus, when such assets meet the conditions in paragraph 4.1.2, they are measured at amortised cost.
Alternative approaches to classifying assets
The fair value changes for each period for those financial assets with basic loan features that are managed on a contractual yield basis would be disaggregated and presented as follows
any difference between the amortised cost measure in (a) and the fair value change for the period would be presented in other comprehensive income.
BC4.42 The IASB also considered variants in which all financial assets and financial liabilities would be measured at fair value.
All financial instruments (including financial liabilities) with basic loan features that are managed on a contractual yield basis would be disaggregated and presented as described in paragraph BC4.41(a) and (b).
Respondents also noted that the alternative approach would apply only to financial assets.
Lastly, almost all respondents noted that splitting gains and losses between profit or loss and other comprehensive income would increase complexity and reduce understandability.
BC4.44 The IASB also considered and rejected the following approaches to classification
However, in the IASB's view, the notion of 'held for trading' is too narrow and cannot appropriately reflect all situations in which amortised cost does not provide useful information.
However, in the IASB's view, such an approach would neither significantly improve nor reduce the complexity of the reporting for financial instruments.
However, in the IASB's view, determining classification solely on the basis of how an entity manages its financial instruments would result in misleading information that is not useful to a user in understanding the risks associated with complex or risky instruments.
The IASB concluded, as had almost all respondents, that the contractual cash flow characteristics condition is required to ensure that amortised cost is used only when it provides information that is useful in predicting the entity's future cash flows.
The IASB rejected that approach because it believes that new conditions would have to be developed in the future to address innovative financial products.
In addition, the IASB noted that such an approach would not be practical because an entity can apply amortised cost only to some types of financial instruments.
The IASB acknowledged that for originated instruments the entity potentially has better information about the future contractual cash flows and credit risk than for purchased loans.
However, the IASB decided not to pursue that approach, mainly because some entities manage originated and purchased loans in the same portfolio.
Distinguishing between originated and purchased loans, which would be done mainly for accounting purposes, would involve systems changes.
A restriction of this kind is often called 'tainting'.
However, the IASB believes that classification based on the entity's business model for managing financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of those financial assets provides a clear rationale for measurement.
Those requirements enable users of financial statements to understand the effects of derecognising before maturity instruments measured at amortised cost and also provides transparency in situations where an entity has measured financial assets at amortised cost on the basis of having an objective of managing those assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows but regularly sells them.
The IASB obtained information and views from its FIWG and from users, regulators, preparers, auditors and others from a range of industries across different geographical regions.
The IASB also developed a questionnaire to ask users of financial statements how they use information about the effects of changes in liabilities' credit risk (if at all) and what their preferred method of accounting is for selected financial liabilities.
measuring liabilities at fair value and presenting in other comprehensive income the portion of the change in fair value that is attributable to changes in the liability's credit risk.
A variant of this alternative would be to present in other comprehensive income the entire change in fair value.
measuring liabilities at an 'adjusted' fair value whereby the liability would be remeasured for all changes in fair value except for the effects of changes in its credit risk (ie 'the frozen credit spread method').
In other words, the effects of changes in its credit risk would be ignored in the primary financial statements.
measuring liabilities at amortised cost.
This would require estimating the cash flows over the life of the instrument, including those cash flows associated with any embedded derivative features.
bifurcating liabilities into hosts and embedded features.
The host contract would be measured at amortised cost and the embedded features (eg embedded derivatives) would be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
That is because an entity generally will not realise the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk unless the liability is held for trading.
However, if a liability has structured features (eg embedded derivatives), amortised cost is difficult to apply and understand because the cash flows can be highly variable.
For many entities, bifurcation avoids the issue of own credit risk because the host is measured at amortised cost and only the derivative is measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Users preferred structured assets to be measured at fair value in their entirety.
Moreover, a new bifurcation methodology would be likely to have the same classification and measurement outcomes as the existing methodology in most cases.
The almost unanimous view was that a 'full' fair value amount is more understandable and useful than an 'adjusted' fair value amount that ignores the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk.
Under existing Standards only entities that elect to designate liabilities under the fair value option are required to determine that amount.
If the IASB were to extend that requirement to more entities and to more financial liabilities, many entities would have significant difficulty determining that amount and could incur significant costs in doing so.
BC4.50 Although there were common themes in the feedback received, there was no consensus on which of the alternative approaches being explored by the IASB was the best way to address the effects of changes in liabilities' credit risk.
Many constituents said that none of the alternatives being discussed was less complex or would result in more useful information than the existing bifurcation requirements.
BC4.51 As a result of the feedback received, the IASB decided to retain almost all of the existing requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.
The IASB decided that the benefits of changing practice at this point do not outweigh the costs of the disruption that such a change would cause.
Liabilities that are held for trading (including all derivative liabilities) would continue to be subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, which is consistent with the widespread view that all fair value changes for those liabilities should affect profit or loss.
BC4.53 The issue of credit risk would remain only in the context of financial liabilities designated under the fair value option.
The fair value measurement option does not require entities to measure more financial instruments at fair value.
originated loans and receivables, including a debt instrument acquired directly from the issuer, unless they met the conditions for classification as held for trading (now in Appendix A of IFRS 9).
financial assets classified as available for sale, unless as an accounting policy choice gains and losses on all available-for-sale financial assets were recognised in profit or loss or they met the conditions for classification as held for trading (now in Appendix A of IFRS 9).
To impose discipline on this approach, the IASB decided that financial instruments should not be reclassified into or out of the category of fair value through profit or loss.
The IASB noted that the requirement (now in IFRS 9) to designate irrevocably on initial recognition the financial instruments for which the fair value option is to be applied results in an entity being unable to 'cherry pick' in this way.
This is because it will not be known at initial recognition whether the fair value of the instrument will increase or decrease.
These constituents were concerned that
entities might apply the fair value option to financial assets or financial liabilities whose fair value is not verifiable.
If so, because the valuation of these financial assets and financial liabilities is subjective, entities might determine their fair value in a way that inappropriately affects profit or loss.
if an entity applied the fair value option to financial liabilities, it might result in an entity recognising gains or losses in profit or loss associated with changes in its own creditworthiness.
when such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as an 'accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise (paragraphs BCZ4.61–BCZ4.63);
when a group of financial assets, financial liabilities or both is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy (paragraphs BCZ4.64–BCZ4.66); and
when an instrument contains an embedded derivative that meets particular conditions (paragraphs BCZ4.67–BCZ4.70).
In particular, for financial instruments designated in this way
it eliminates the need for hedge accounting for hedges of fair value exposures when there are natural offsets, and thereby eliminates the related burden of designating, tracking and analysing hedge effectiveness.
it eliminates the burden of separating embedded derivatives.
it eliminates problems arising from a mixed measurement model when financial assets are measured at fair value and related financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
In particular, it eliminates volatility in profit or loss and equity that results when matched positions of financial assets and financial liabilities are not measured consistently.
the option to recognise unrealised gains and losses on available-for-sale financial assets in profit or loss is no longer necessary.
it de-emphasises interpretative issues around what constitutes trading.
Designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch
For example, a liability may be considered to be related to an asset when they share a risk that gives rise to opposite changes in fair value that tend to offset, or when the entity considers that the liability funds the asset.
BCZ4.62 Some entities could overcome measurement or recognition inconsistencies by using hedge accounting or, in the case of insurers, shadow accounting.
However, the IASB recognised that those techniques are complex and do not address all situations.
For example, it considered whether entities should be required to demonstrate that particular assets and liabilities are managed together, or that a management strategy is effective in reducing risk (as is required for hedge accounting to be used), or that hedge accounting or other ways of overcoming the inconsistency are not available.
BCZ4.63 The IASB concluded that accounting mismatches arise in a wide variety of circumstances.
In the IASB's view, financial reporting is best served by providing entities with the opportunity to eliminate perceived accounting mismatches whenever that results in more relevant information.
Furthermore, the IASB concluded that the fair value option may validly be used in place of hedge accounting for hedges of fair value exposures, thereby eliminating the related burden of designating, tracking and analysing hedge effectiveness.
Hence, the IASB decided not to develop detailed prescriptive guidance about when the fair value option could be applied (such as requiring effectiveness tests similar to those required for hedge accounting) in the amendment on the fair value option.
Instead, the IASB decided to require disclosures (now in IFRS 7) about
the criteria an entity uses for designating financial assets and financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss
how the entity satisfies the conditions for such designation
the nature of the assets and liabilities so designated
the effect on the financial statement of using this designation, namely the carrying amounts and net gains and losses on assets and liabilities so designated, information about the effect of changes in a financial liability's credit quality on changes in its fair value, and information about the credit risk of loans or receivables and any related credit derivatives or similar instruments.
A group of financial assets, financial liabilities or both is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis
However, the IASB recognised that some entities manage and evaluate the performance of financial instruments on a fair value basis in other situations.
Furthermore, for instruments managed and evaluated in this way, users of financial statements may regard fair value measurement as providing more relevant information.
Finally, it is established practice in some industries in some jurisdictions to recognise all financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
BCZ4.66 In looking to an entity's documented risk management or investment strategy, the IASB made no judgement on what an entity's strategy should be.
However, the IASB noted that users, in making economic decisions, would find useful both a description of the chosen strategy and how designation at fair value through profit or loss is consistent with it.
Such disclosures are required (now in IFRS 7).
The IASB also noted that the required documentation of the entity's strategy need not be item by item, nor need it be in the level of detail required for hedge accounting.
However, it should be sufficient to demonstrate that using the fair value option is consistent with the entity's risk management or investment strategy.
In many cases, the entity's existing documentation, as approved by its key management personnel, should be sufficient for this purpose.
The instrument contains an embedded derivative that meets particular conditions
This requirement extended to derivatives that are embedded in an instrument that also includes a non-derivative host if the embedded derivative met particular conditions.
Conversely, if the embedded derivative did not meet those conditions, separate accounting with measurement of the embedded derivative at fair value is prohibited.
Consequently, to satisfy these requirements, the entity must
if the embedded derivative is one that must be separated, determine its fair value at initial recognition and subsequently.
BCZ4.68 For some embedded derivatives, like the prepayment option in an ordinary residential mortgage, this process is fairly simple.
Those structured products will typically be hedged with derivatives that offset all (or nearly all) of the risks they contain, whether or not the embedded derivatives that give rise to those risks are separated for accounting purposes.
Hence, the simplest way to account for such products is to apply the fair value option so that the combined contract (as well as the derivatives that hedge it) is measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Furthermore, for these more complex instruments, the fair value of the combined contract may be significantly easier to measure and hence be more reliable than the fair value of only those embedded derivatives that are required to be separated.
The IASB determined that allowing the fair value option to be used for any instrument with an embedded derivative would make other restrictions on the use of the option ineffective, because many financial instruments include an embedded derivative.
In contrast, limiting the use of the fair value option to situations in which the embedded derivative must otherwise be separated would not significantly reduce the costs of compliance and could result in less reliable measures being included in the financial statements.
Consequently, the IASB decided to specify situations in which an entity cannot justify using the fair value option in place of assessing embedded derivatives — when the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that would otherwise be required by the contract or is one for which it is clear with little or no analysis when a similar hybrid instrument is first considered that separation is prohibited.
The role of prudential supervisors
BCZ4.71 The IASB considered the circumstances of regulated financial institutions such as banks and insurers in determining the extent to which conditions should be placed on the use of the fair value option.
The IASB recognised that regulated financial institutions are extensive holders and issuers of financial instruments and so are likely to be among the largest potential users of the fair value option.
However, the IASB noted that some of the prudential supervisors that oversee these entities expressed concern that the fair value option might be used inappropriately.
BCZ4.72 The IASB noted that the primary objective of prudential supervisors is to maintain the financial soundness of individual financial institutions and the stability of the financial system as a whole.
Prudential supervisors achieve this objective partly by assessing the risk profile of each regulated institution and imposing a risk-based capital requirement.
However, the IASB acknowledged that for the purposes of determining what level of capital an institution should maintain, prudential supervisors may wish to understand the circumstances in which a regulated financial institution has chosen to apply the fair value option and evaluate the rigour of the institution's fair value measurement practices and the robustness of its underlying risk management strategies, policies and practices.
Furthermore, the IASB agreed that certain disclosures would assist both prudential supervisors in their evaluation of capital requirements and investors in making economic decisions.
In particular, the IASB decided to require an entity to disclose how it has satisfied the conditions for using the fair value option, including, for instruments that are now within paragraph 4.2.2(b) of IFRS 9, a narrative description of how designation at fair value through profit or loss is consistent with the entity's documented risk management or investment strategy.
Application of the fair value option to a component or a proportion (instead of the entirety) of a financial asset or a financial liability
The IASB was concerned that such an extension would require prescriptive guidance on how to determine a proportion.
The IASB was also concerned that the remaining proportion, not being subject to the fair value option, could give rise to incentives for an entity to 'cherry pick' (ie to realise financial assets or financial liabilities selectively so as to achieve a desired accounting result).
For these reasons, the IASB decided not to allow the fair value option to be applied to a proportion of a single financial asset or financial liability (that restriction is now in IFRS 9).
Option to designate a financial asset at fair value
any financial asset that is not managed within a business model that has the objective of collecting contractual cash flows to be measured at fair value; and
hybrid contracts with financial asset hosts to be classified in their entirety, hence eliminating the requirement to identify and account for embedded derivatives separately.
Accordingly, the IASB concluded that the conditions described in paragraph BC4.77(b) and (c) are unnecessary for financial assets.
BC4.79 The IASB retained the eligibility condition described in paragraph BC4.77(a) because it mitigates some anomalies that result from the different measurement attributes used for financial instruments.
In particular, it eliminates the need for fair value hedge accounting of fair value exposures when there are natural offsets.
It also avoids problems arising from a mixed measurement model when some financial assets are measured at amortised cost and related financial liabilities are measured at fair value.
A separate phase of the project is considering hedge accounting, and the fair value option will be better considered in that context.
The IASB also noted that particular industry sectors believe it is important to be able to mitigate such anomalies until other IASB projects are completed (eg insurance contracts).
The IASB decided to defer consideration of changes to the eligibility condition set out in paragraph BC4.77(a) as part of the future exposure draft on hedge accounting.
Option to designate a financial liability at fair value
However, the IASB decided that such changes were not necessary because the IASB was not changing the underlying classification and measurement approach for financial liabilities.
Some would have preferred an unrestricted fair value option.
Respondents, and others, also noted the many application problems that arose from requirements to assess all non-derivative contracts for embedded derivatives and, if required, to account for and measure those embedded derivatives separately as stand-alone derivatives.
to use the same classification approach for all financial assets (including hybrid contracts).
Both approaches would result in hybrid contracts being classified using conditions different from those that would be applied to all non-hybrid financial instruments.
The IASB also believes that neither approach would make it easier for users of financial statements to understand the information that financial statements present about financial instruments.
The IASB concluded that a single classification approach for all financial instruments and hybrid contracts with financial hosts was the only approach that responded adequately to the criticisms described above.
The IASB noted that using a single classification approach improves comparability by ensuring consistency in classification, and hence makes it easier for users to understand the information that financial statements present about financial instruments.
Many constituents agreed with this conclusion.
Accordingly it is an exception to the definition of the unit of account (the contract) motivated by a wish to avoid abuse.
It would reduce complexity to eliminate an anti-abuse exception.
However, the IASB noted that this would provide more relevant information because the embedded derivative feature affects the cash flows ultimately arising from the hybrid contract.
Thus, applying the classification approach to the hybrid contract in its entirety would depict more faithfully the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows.
The IASB also noted the importance for many non-financial entities of hedge accounting for non-financial items, and the relationship to both scope and embedded derivative requirements.
BCZ4.92 A rationale for the embedded derivatives requirements is that an entity should not be able to circumvent the recognition and measurement requirements for derivatives merely by embedding a derivative in a non-derivative financial instrument or other contract, for example, a commodity forward in a debt instrument.
To achieve consistency in accounting for such embedded derivatives, all derivatives embedded in financial instruments that are not measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in profit or loss ought to be accounted for separately as derivatives.
However, as a practical expedient, an embedded derivative need not be separated if it is regarded as closely related to its host contract.
When the embedded derivative bears a close economic relationship to the host contract, such as a cap or a floor on the interest rate on a loan, it is less likely that the derivative was embedded to achieve a desired accounting result.
Such foreign currency derivatives are regarded as bearing such a close economic relationship to their host contracts that they do not have to be separated.
BCZ4.94 The requirement to separate embedded foreign currency derivatives may be burdensome for entities that operate in economies in which business contracts denominated in a foreign currency are common.
For example, entities domiciled in small countries may find it convenient to denominate business contracts with entities from other small countries in an internationally liquid currency (such as the US dollar, euro or yen) instead of the local currency of any of the parties to the transaction.
In addition, an entity operating in a hyperinflationary economy may use a price list in a hard currency to protect against inflation, for example, an entity that has a foreign operation in a hyperinflationary economy that denominates local contracts in the functional currency of the parent.
BCZ4.95 In revising IAS 39, the IASB concluded that an embedded foreign currency derivative may be integral to the contractual arrangements in the cases mentioned in the previous paragraph.
It decided that a foreign currency derivative in a contract should not be required to be separated if it is denominated in a currency that is commonly used in business transactions (that are not financial instruments) in the environment in which the transaction takes place (that guidance is now in IFRS 9).
The inconsistency related to whether these are considered closely related to the loan.
a currency that is commonly used in contracts to purchase or sell non-financial items in the economic environment in which the transaction takes place (eg a relatively stable and liquid currency that is commonly used in local business transactions or external trade).
Assume that when an entity first became a party to a contract, it assessed the contract as containing an embedded derivative that was closely related and hence not accounted for separately.
Assume that subsequently market conditions change and that if the entity were to reassess the contract under the changed circumstances it would conclude that the embedded derivative is not closely related and therefore requires separate accounting.
(The converse could also arise.) The issue was whether the entity should make such a reassessment.
Changes in external circumstances are not ways to circumvent the requirements.
The IFRIC therefore concluded that reassessment was not appropriate for such changes.
The IFRIC noted that requiring entities to reassess embedded derivatives in all hybrid instruments could be onerous because frequent monitoring would be required.
Market conditions and other factors affecting embedded derivatives would have to be monitored continuously to ensure timely identification of a change in circumstances and amendment of the accounting treatment accordingly.
An embedded floor or cap on the interest rate on a debt contract or insurance contract is closely related to the host contract, provided the cap is at or above the market rate of interest and the floor is at or below the market rate of interest when the contract is issued, and the cap or floor is not leveraged in relation to the host contract.
Similarly, provisions included in a contract to purchase or sell an asset (eg a commodity) that establish a cap and a floor on the price to be paid or received for the asset are closely related to the host contract if both the cap and floor were out of the money at inception and are not leveraged.
BCZ4.105 The IFRIC also considered the implications of requiring subsequent reassessment.
If the entity were required to reassess whether the embedded derivative was to be accounted for separately and if the entity concluded some time after becoming a party to the contract that the derivative was no longer required to be separated, then questions of recognition and measurement would arise.
In the above circumstances, the IFRIC identified the following possibilities
This would lead to recognition of a gain or loss even though there had been no transaction and no change in the value of the total contract or its components.
Should it be amortised (and, if so, how would the amortisation affect the effective interest rate of the asset), or should it be derecognised only when the asset is derecognised?
In some cases, it could also result in a negative effective interest rate.
The IFRIC noted that, under its view that subsequent reassessment is appropriate only when there has been a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract, the above issues do not arise.
Consequently, if an entity purchases a contract that contains an embedded derivative it assesses whether the embedded derivative needs to be separated and accounted for as a derivative on the basis of conditions at that date.
Similarly, the Board noted that common control transactions might raise the same issue depending on which level of the group reporting entity is assessing the combination.
The investment in the associate is the asset the investor controls and recognises, not the underlying assets and liabilities of the associate.
The IASB's rationale for that proposal was as follows
Some were also concerned that opportunistic reclassifications would be possible.
They noted that in an approach based on an entity's business model for managing financial assets, reclassifications would provide useful, relevant and comparable information to users because it would ensure that financial statements faithfully represent how those financial assets are managed at the reporting date.
In particular, most users stated that, conceptually, reclassifications should not be prohibited when the classification no longer reflects how the instruments would be classified if the items were newly acquired.
If reclassification were prohibited, the reported information would not reflect the amounts, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows.
BC4.114 The IASB was persuaded by these arguments and decided that reclassification should not be prohibited.
The IASB noted that prohibiting reclassification decreases comparability for like instruments managed in the same way.
However, the IASB noted that permitting reclassification would decrease comparability, both between different entities and for instruments held by a single entity, and would enable an entity to manage its profit or loss by selecting the timing of when future gains or losses are recognised.
Consequently, the IASB decided that reclassification should be required when the entity's business model for managing those financial assets changes.
BC4.117 The IASB considered arguments that reclassification should also be permitted or required when contractual cash flow characteristics of a financial asset vary (or may vary) over that asset's life based on its original contractual terms.
However, the IASB noted that, unlike a change in business model, the contractual terms of a financial asset are known at initial recognition.
An entity classifies the financial asset at initial recognition on the basis of the contractual terms over the life of the instrument.
Consequently, the IASB decided that reclassification on the basis of a financial asset's contractual cash flows should not be permitted.
BC4.118 The IASB considered how reclassifications should be accounted for.
Almost all respondents said that reclassifications should be accounted for prospectively and should be accompanied by robust disclosures.
The IASB reasoned that if classification and reclassification are based on the business model within which they are managed, classification should always reflect the business model within which the financial asset was managed at the reporting date.
To apply the reclassification retrospectively would not reflect how the financial assets were managed at the prior reporting dates.
BC4.119 The IASB also considered the date at which reclassifications could take effect.
Some respondents stated that reclassifications should be reflected in the entity's financial statements as soon as the entity's business model for the relevant instruments changes.
To do otherwise would be contradictory to the objective of reclassification — ie to reflect how the instruments are managed.
BC4.120 The IASB also considered and rejected the following approaches
However, in the IASB's view, disclosure is not an adequate substitute for recognition.
Proponents of this approach indicated that such an approach might minimise abuse of the reclassification requirements and result in more instruments being measured at fair value.
BCZ4.122 The definition of a financial asset or financial liability at fair value through profit or loss excludes derivatives that are designated and effective hedging instruments.
The IASB noted that the prohibition on reclassification might be read as preventing a derivative financial instrument that becomes a designated and effective hedging instrument from being excluded from the fair value through profit or loss category in accordance with the definition.
Similarly, it might be read as preventing a derivative that ceases to be a designated and effective hedging instrument from being accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Some asked questions or raised application issues related to the requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets.
However, the boards remained committed to trying to achieve increased comparability internationally in the accounting for financial instruments.
consider the interaction between the classification and measurement of financial assets and the accounting for insurance contract liabilities;
seek to reduce key differences with the FASB's tentative classification and measurement model for financial instruments.
Thus, the IASB decided to focus only on the following issues
interrelated issues arising from these topics (for example, disclosure requirements and the model for financial liabilities).
BC4.130 At the same time, the FASB had been discussing its tentative model for classifying and measuring financial instruments.
The boards developed a plan for joint redeliberations on the basis of the feedback received.
That plan reflected the fact that the feedback differed in a number of ways.
Specifically, many of the FASB's respondents questioned whether a new comprehensive classification and measurement model was needed and raised concerns about the complexity of the proposals.
Many of those respondents advocated that the FASB should consider making targeted improvements to current US GAAP (particularly to the current requirements for bifurcating financial instruments).
Consequently, while agreeing to joint redeliberations, the FASB indicated that after those redeliberations were complete, it would consider whether it would confirm the model that the boards had been jointly discussing or pursue another approach (for example, targeted improvements to US GAAP).
The boards' plan for redeliberations also reflected the fact that the boards had different scopes for their redeliberations, which reflected their different starting points.
Accordingly the boards' project plan envisaged both joint and separate redeliberations.
Most of the decisions were made jointly and there was general agreement on the key aspects.
However, there were differences in the boards' decisions on specific details, such as the assessment of some contingent and prepayment features as well as the articulation of particular aspects of the business model assessment.
BC4.134 Subsequent to the joint discussions, the FASB continued to discuss at FASB-only public meetings the assessment of an asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the assessment of an entity's business model for managing financial assets.
A financial asset was measured at amortised cost only if it was held within a business model whose objective was to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (a 'hold to collect' business model), subject also to an assessment of the asset's contractual cash flow characteristics.
All other financial assets were measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Paragraph BC4.15–BC4.21 describe the IASB's rationale for that assessment.
the level of sales activity that is consistent with a hold to collect business model;
the effect on the classification of an entity's financial assets if the entity's sales activity in a particular period appears to contradict the hold to collect business model objective — specifically, the consequences both on the classification of assets that the entity currently holds (ie those assets that the entity has already recognised) and on the classification of assets that it may hold in the future; and
how to classify some portfolios of assets — in particular, so-called 'liquidity portfolios' that banks hold to satisfy their actual or potential liquidity needs, often in response to regulatory requirements.
More generally, some interested parties said that significant judgement was needed to classify some financial assets and, as a result, there was some inconsistency in views in practice about whether the objective of particular business models was to hold to collect contractual cash flows.
These views mainly related to
whether measurement at fair value through profit or loss appropriately reflects the performance of financial assets that are managed both in order to collect contractual cash flows and for sale.
The hold to collect business model
The proposals also clarified and supplemented that principle with additional application guidance on the types of business activities and the frequency and nature of sales that are consistent, and inconsistent, with a hold to collect business model.
The IASB noted that that assessment is consistent with determining whether the cash flows from the financial assets will arise from the collection of their contractual cash flows.
The IASB also noted that it expects that sales out of the amortised cost measurement category will be less frequent than sales out of the other measurement categories, because holding assets to collect contractual cash flows is integral to achieving the objective of a hold to collect business model, while selling financial assets to realise cash flows (including fair value changes) is only incidental to that objective.
Consequently, selling a financial asset when its credit quality has deteriorated is consistent with an objective to collect contractual cash flows.
Specifically, the respondents said that the proposals placed too much emphasis on the frequency and volume of sales instead of focusing on the reasons for those sales and whether those sales are consistent with a hold to collect business model.
Some respondents also expressed the view that selling financial assets to manage concentrations of credit risk (for example, selling financial assets in order to limit the amount of instruments held that are issued in a particular jurisdiction) should not be inconsistent with a hold to collect business model.
The IASB noted that amortised cost is a simple measurement technique that allocates interest over time using the effective interest rate, which is based on contractual cash flows.
Accordingly, amortised cost provides relevant and useful information about the amounts, timing and uncertainty of cash flows only if the contractual cash flows will be collected.
BC4.144 The IASB confirmed that although the objective of an entity's business model may be to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, the entity need not hold all of those assets until maturity.
Some sales out of the hold to collect business model are expected to occur (ie some financial assets will be derecognised for accounting purposes before maturity).
The IASB noted that the level of sales activity (ie the frequency and value of sales), and the reasons for those sales, play a role in assessing the objective of the business model because that assessment focuses on determining how the entity actually manages assets to generate cash flows from the financial assets.
The IASB noted that while an entity should consider historical sales information, that information does not imply that newly originated or newly purchased assets should be classified differently from period to period solely on the basis of sales activity in prior periods.
In other words, fluctuations in sales activity in particular periods do not necessarily mean that the entity's business model has changed.
The entity will need to consider the reasons for those sales and whether they are consistent with a hold to collect business model.
For example, a change in the regulatory treatment of a particular type of financial asset may cause an entity to undertake a significant rebalancing of its portfolio in a particular period.
The entity also needs to consider information about past sales within the context of the conditions that existed at that time as compared to existing conditions and expectations about future conditions.
Accordingly, the IASB noted that selling a financial asset when concerns arise about the collectability of the contractual cash flows is consistent with the objective of a hold to collect business model.
The IASB noted that this guidance does not require that the entity wait to sell the financial asset until it has incurred a credit loss or until there has been a significant increase in credit risk (and lifetime expected credit losses are recognised on the asset).
Instead, a sale would be consistent with the objective of a hold to collect business model if the asset's credit risk has increased based on reasonable and supportable information, including forward looking information.
The IASB decided that such sales should be assessed in the same manner as other sales.
If not, the entity would need to consider the frequency, value and timing of such sales, as well as the reasons for those sales, to determine whether they are consistent with a hold to collect business model.
The IASB noted that the notion of credit concentration risk is applied fairly broadly in practice and may include changes in the entity's investment policy or strategy that are not related to credit deterioration.
The IASB noted that frequent sales that are significant in value and labelled as 'due to credit concentration risk' (but that are not related to an increase in the assets' credit risk) are likely to be inconsistent with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows.
Fair value through other comprehensive income
Others pointed out that, at the time, the FASB was considering a tentative model that included a fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category.
has contractual cash flow characteristics that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding; and
is held within a business model in which assets are managed both in order to collect contractual cash flows and for sale (a 'hold to collect and sell' business model).
BC4.150 The IASB noted that the performance of a hold to collect and sell business model will be affected by both the collection of contractual cash flows and the realisation of fair values.
Accordingly, the IASB decided that both amortised cost and fair value information are relevant and useful and therefore decided to propose that both sets of information are presented in the financial statements.
interest revenue using the effective interest method that is applied to financial assets measured at amortised cost; and
impairment gains and losses using the same methodology that is applied to financial assets measured at amortised cost.
The difference between the total change in fair value and the amounts recognised in profit or loss would be presented in other comprehensive income.
The IASB noted that amortised cost information would not be provided in profit or loss unless the gains or losses previously accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled to profit or loss when the financial asset is derecognised — and, therefore, recycling was a key feature of the proposed fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category.
Specifically, in accordance with IFRS 9, an entity is prohibited from recycling the gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income related to the following financial instruments
financial liabilities designated under the fair value option for which the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income (see paragraphs 5.7.7 and B5.7.9 of IFRS 9).
For financial assets mandatorily measured in accordance with the new fair value through other comprehensive income category, the IASB proposed that the same impairment approach would apply to those financial assets as is applied to financial assets measured at amortised cost.
While recycling is prohibited, the IASB observed that an entity is not prohibited from presenting information in the financial statements about realised gains or losses on investments in equity instruments; for example, as a separate line item in other comprehensive income.
Consequently, exchange differences on the amortised cost (ie interest revenue calculated using the effective interest method and impairment gains and losses) would be recognised in profit or loss, with all other exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income.
Consequently, when the entity holds both insurance contract liabilities and financial assets that qualify to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, particular changes in both the fair value of the financial assets (ie those changes other than interest revenue and impairment gains and losses) and the current value of the insurance contract liabilities (ie those changes arising from the effects of changes in the discount rate) would be presented in other comprehensive income.
Some of those respondents agreed with the measurement category as proposed by the IASB, while others agreed in principle with the proposals but made suggestions related to the conditions for that new measurement category.
For example, some respondents expressed the view that a financial asset should be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income as long as it is held in a hold to collect and sell business model (ie irrespective of the asset's contractual cash flow characteristics) and others suggested that the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category should be an option (either in addition to, or instead of, a mandatory measurement category).
The IASB believes that this measurement category is appropriate for financial assets that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest and that are held in a hold to collect and sell business model.
For those financial assets, the IASB believes that both amortised cost and fair value information are relevant and useful because such information reflects how cash flows are realised.
That is, holding financial assets to collect contractual cash flows is integral to achieving the objective of the hold to collect and sell business model and therefore the amounts presented in profit or loss provide amortised cost information while the entity holds the assets.
However, because selling assets is also integral to achieving the objective of the hold to collect and sell business model, those other fair value changes are presented in other comprehensive income and the financial asset is presented at fair value in the statement of financial position.
BC4.158 Also, in order to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, a financial asset must have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
This is because amortised cost information is presented in profit or loss for assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and, as the IASB has consistently stated, the amortised cost measurement attribute provides relevant and useful information only for financial assets with 'simple' contractual cash flows (ie contractual cash flows that are solely principal and interest).
Amortised cost is a relatively simple measurement technique that allocates interest over the relevant time period using the effective interest rate.
As discussed in paragraph BC4.23, the IASB's long-held view is that the effective interest method, which underpins amortised cost measurement, is not an appropriate method for allocating 'complex' contractual cash flows (ie contractual cash flows that are not solely principal and interest).
BC4.159 The IASB also discussed during its redeliberations whether the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category should be optional — either in addition to, or instead of, a mandatory measurement category.
However, the IASB believes that such an option would be inconsistent with, and indeed would undermine, its decision to classify financial assets as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income on the basis of their contractual cash flows and the business model within which they are held.
Moreover, the IASB noted that users of financial statements have both consistently opposed permitting too much optionality in accounting requirements and have also advocated accounting requirements that provide comparability.
BC4.160 In order to improve the clarity of the application guidance related to the hold to collect and sell business model, the IASB decided to emphasise that holding and selling are not the objectives of the business model, but instead are the outcomes of the business model.
That is, collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are the outcomes of the way in which an entity manages its financial assets to achieve the objective of a particular business model.
For example, an entity with a long-term investment strategy that has an objective of matching the cash flows on long-term liabilities or matching the duration of liabilities with the cash flows on financial assets may have a hold to collect and sell business model.
The IASB decided to clarify that measuring financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income provides relevant and useful information to users of financial statements only when realising cash flows by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are both integral to achieving the objective of the business model.
However, the IASB believes that measuring particular financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income reflects the assets' performance better than measuring those assets at either amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss.
Fair value through profit or loss
The IASB acknowledged that there might be some benefits in making fair value through other comprehensive income the residual measurement category, because, arguably, a clearer distinction could be made between the conditions for the amortised cost measurement category and the conditions for the fair value through profit or loss measurement category.
Amortised cost information is provided in profit or loss for both the amortised cost measurement category and the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category, and this information is relevant only for financial assets with particular contractual cash flow characteristics that are held within particular business models.
That is, amortised cost information is relevant only if the financial asset has contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest and the asset is held in a business model in which collecting contractual cash flows is integral to achieving its objective.
As a result, the IASB believes that it would be inappropriate if either amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income was the residual measurement category.
Furthermore, the IASB believes that defining the conditions for the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category strengthens and clarifies the conditions for the amortised cost measurement category.
In addition, to respond to feedback received, the IASB confirmed that financial assets that are held for trading purposes and financial assets that are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis must be measured at fair value through profit or loss, because they are held neither in a hold to collect business model nor in a hold to collect and sell business model.
Instead, the entity makes decisions on the basis of changes in, and with the objective of realising, the assets' fair value.
Thus, the IASB believes that relevant and useful information about the amounts, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows is provided to users of financial statements only if these financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The approach was a 'business-activity approach' and was similar to the tentative approach that the FASB had been considering immediately prior to the start of the boards' joint deliberations.
In summary, the business-activity approach would have classified financial assets on the basis of the business activity that the entity uses in acquiring and managing those financial assets, subject to an assessment of the asset's contractual cash flow characteristics.
The business-activity approach focused on the strategy that resulted in an entity's initial recognition of the financial asset.
In order to be considered a lending (or customer financing) business activity, in addition to holding the financial assets to collect substantially all of the contractual cash flows, the entity must also have had the ability to negotiate adjustments to the contractual cash flows with the counterparty in the event of a potential credit loss.
In addition, the IASB noted that measuring financial assets at amortised cost only if the entity has the ability to negotiate the asset's terms with the counterparty might be unduly costly to implement and complex to apply and also might result in different classification of lending activities solely as a result of the different legal frameworks in different jurisdictions.
Accordingly, the IASB decided not to pursue the business-activity approach and instead confirmed the approach in IFRS 9, in which financial assets are measured at amortised cost if they are held with an objective to collect contractual cash flows (subject to the assessment of the asset's contractual cash flow characteristics) and reaffirmed the rationale for the business model assessment set out in paragraphs BC4.15–BC4.21.
Those alternative approaches, as well as the feedback received and the IASB's rationale for ultimately rejecting the approaches, are described in more detail in paragraphs BC4.41–BC4.43.
Moreover, the alternative approaches prohibited recycling and therefore did not present both fair value and amortised cost information in the financial statements.
Solely payments of principal and interest
A financial asset was measured at amortised cost only if its contractual terms gave rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, subject to the assessment of the business model within which the asset is held.
For the purposes of assessing the contractual cash flow characteristics of a financial asset, interest was consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time.
Paragraph BC4.22 noted that a premium for liquidity risk may be included.
Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest method, which is a relatively simple measurement technique that allocates interest over the relevant time period using the effective interest rate.
The IASB believes that the effective interest method is suitable only for instruments with 'simple' cash flows that represent solely principal and interest.
In contrast, as set out in paragraph BC4.23, the effective interest method is not an appropriate method for allocating contractual cash flows that are not principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Instead those more complex cash flows require a valuation overlay to contractual cash flows (ie fair value) to ensure that the reported financial information provides useful information.
The discussion of the example (Instrument B) concluded that such contractual cash flows are not payments of principal and interest, because the interest rate does not represent consideration for the time value of money for the tenor of the instrument (or the reset period).
Specifically, the IASB proposed that a financial asset does not necessarily need to be measured at fair value through profit or loss if the economic relationship between principal and the consideration for time value of money and credit risk is modified by an interest rate tenor mismatch feature.
Instead, an entity would be required to assess the effect of the modified relationship on the financial asset's contractual cash flows relative to a 'perfect' benchmark instrument (ie a financial instrument with the same credit quality and with the same contractual terms except for the contractual term under evaluation).
If the modification could result in contractual cash flows that are more than insignificantly different from the benchmark cash flows, the contractual terms of the financial asset would not give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Interested parties noted that in such environments the base interest rates are set by a central authority and may not be reset in a manner that reflects the reset period.
In these circumstances, the effect of the interest rate tenor mismatch feature could be significant.
Furthermore, in such environments, there may not be any financial instruments available that are priced on a different basis.
Thus, some raised concerns about how to determine whether the cash flows on such instruments are solely payments of principal and interest and whether the proposed notion of a modified economic relationship was operational and appropriate in such environments.
However, many respondents believed that the clarification did not go far enough in addressing common application questions and expressed concern that some financial assets that they view as 'plain vanilla' or 'normal lending' would still not have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.
They asked the IASB to clarify the scope of the assessment of a modified economic relationship (for example, whether it should apply only to interest rate tenor mismatch features or more broadly to all circumstances in which the time value of money element is modified (ie imperfect)) and to reconsider the threshold used in that assessment (ie the threshold of 'not more than insignificantly different' from benchmark cash flows).
BC4.177 In its redeliberations, the IASB acknowledged respondents' questions and concerns and, as a result, decided to clarify the following items
In assessing the time value of money element, the entity must consider the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, because interest rates vary by currency.
In addition, as a general proposition, there must be a link between the interest rate and the period for which the interest rate is set, because the appropriate rate for an instrument varies depending on the term for which the rate is set.
In these cases, an entity must assess whether the time value of money element provides consideration for only the passage of time by performing either a quantitative or qualitative assessment.
The IASB decided not to prescribe when an entity must perform a quantitative versus a qualitative assessment.
However, the IASB noted that the objective of a modified time value of money element is not to provide consideration for just the passage of time, and thus the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest, if the contractual cash flows could be significantly different from the benchmark cash flows.
BC4.178 The IASB also noted that, as a general proposition, the market in which the transaction occurs is relevant to the assessment of the time value of money element.
For example, in Europe it is common to reference interest rates to LIBOR and in the United States it is common to reference interest rates to the prime rate.
However the IASB noted that a particular interest rate does not necessarily reflect consideration for only the time value of money merely because that rate is considered 'normal' in a particular market.
Accordingly the IASB believes that an entity must apply judgement to conclude whether the stated time value of money element meets the objective of providing consideration for only the passage of time.
BC4.179 The IASB noted that in some jurisdictions the government or regulatory authority establishes interest rates and, in some cases, the objective of the time value of money element may not be to provide consideration for only the passage of time.
BC4.180 The IASB acknowledged that this approach for regulated interest rates is broader than the approach for interest rates that are established freely by market participants.
However, the IASB noted that these regulated rates are set for public policy reasons and thus are not subject to structuring to achieve a particular accounting result.
For example, the IASB noted that French retail banks collect deposits on special 'Livret A' savings accounts.
The interest rate is determined by the central bank and the government according to a formula that reflects protection against inflation and an adequate remuneration that incentivises entities to use these particular savings accounts.
This is because legislation requires a particular portion of the amounts collected by the retail banks to be lent to a governmental agency that uses the proceeds for social programmes.
the meaning of 'principal' — respondents asked the IASB to clarify the meaning of principal, in particular within the context of financial assets that are originated or purchased at a premium or discount to par;
In discussing the elements of interest (and indeed the overall objective of the assessment of an asset's contractual cash flows), the IASB considered the concept of a 'basic lending arrangement' (the form of which need not be that of a loan).
In such an arrangement, the IASB noted that interest may include consideration for elements other than the time value of money and credit risk.
Specifically, interest may include consideration for risks such as liquidity risk and costs associated with holding the asset (such as administrative costs) as well as a profit margin.
But elements that introduce exposure to risks or variability in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to lending (such as exposure to equity or commodity price risk) are not consistent with a basic lending arrangement.
The IASB also noted that the assessment of interest focuses on what the entity is being compensated for (ie whether the entity is receiving consideration for basic lending risks, costs and a profit margin or is being compensated for something else), instead of how much the entity receives for a particular element.
For example, the IASB acknowledged that different entities may price the credit risk element differently.
The IASB noted that to make this determination an entity must consider the potential effect of the feature in each reporting period and cumulatively over the life of the instrument.
For example, a feature would not have a de minimis effect if it could give rise to a significant increase in contractual cash flows in one reporting period and a significant decrease in contractual cash flows in another reporting period, even if these amounts offset each other on a cumulative basis.
Contractual terms that change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows, including prepayment and extension features
In summary, that guidance stated that prepayment and extension features result in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest only if
the prepayment or extension feature is not contingent on future events, other than to protect the holder or issuer against particular events or circumstances; and
the terms of the prepayment or extension feature result in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.
The guidance for prepayment features stated that the prepayment amount may include reasonable additional compensation for the early termination of the contract.
However if a contractual term is not genuine, it does not affect the classification of a financial asset.
(Consistently with IAS 32, a contractual feature is not genuine if it affects the asset's contractual cash flows only on the occurrence of an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely to occur.)
Respondents also asked whether (and if so, why) the nature of the future event in itself affects whether the financial asset's contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.
These respondents generally expressed the view that an entity should focus on the contractual cash flows that could arise over the life of the financial instrument (ie both before and after the future event), instead of on the nature of the future event itself.
BC4.186 In addition, some respondents expressed the view that a contingent feature should not affect the classification and measurement of a financial asset if the likelihood is remote that the future event will occur.
Some of these respondents were specifically concerned about contingently convertible instruments or so-called 'bail-in' instruments.
While the contractual terms of these instruments vary, generally, interested parties raised concerns about contingently convertible instruments that convert into equity instruments of the issuer on the basis of a predetermined ratio if a specified event occurs (for example, if the issuer's regulatory capital ratios decline below a specific threshold).
These respondents expressed the view that these instruments should not be measured at fair value through profit or loss merely as a result of the contingent cash flow characteristics (ie the conversion into a predetermined number of the issuer's equity instruments or the write-off of particular unpaid amounts upon the occurrence of a particular future event) if it is unlikely that the future event will occur.
These respondents noted that if principal is described as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition, then the prepayment amount (ie par) will not represent unpaid amounts of principal and interest.
That is because the prepayment amount will either be more than unpaid amounts of principal and interest (if the asset is purchased or originated at a significant discount) or less than unpaid amounts of principal and interest (if the asset is purchased or originated at a significant premium).
Respondents stated that discounts and premiums are generally expected to arise when the entity does not expect that the asset will be prepaid (even though prepayment is contractually possible).
Many of these assets will be purchased at a significant discount to par, which reflects the credit impairment, but the contractual terms may include a prepayment feature.
Respondents expressed the view that an entity should not be required to measure purchased credit-impaired financial assets at fair value through profit or loss merely as a result of the prepayment feature, particularly because it is highly unlikely that such an asset will be prepaid at its contractual par amount since it is credit impaired.
However, the IASB noted that there often is an important interaction between the nature of the future event and the resulting contractual cash flows.
Consequently, it is often helpful (or perhaps even necessary) for the entity to consider the nature of the future event to determine whether the resulting contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.
For example, if the nature of the future event is unrelated to a basic lending arrangement (for example, a particular equity or commodity index reaches or exceeds a particular level), it is unlikely that the resulting contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, because those cash flows are likely to reflect a return for equity or commodity price risk.
In other words, a financial asset must be measured at fair value through profit or loss if a remote (but genuine) contingency would result in contractual cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest (and those contractual cash flows are not de minimis).
In reaching that conclusion, the IASB considered an alternative approach in which a contingent feature would not affect the classification and measurement of a financial asset if the likelihood is remote that the future event will occur.
The IASB rejected this approach because it is inconsistent with its long-standing view that amortised cost provides relevant and useful information only for financial assets with simple contractual cash flows.
As noted in paragraph BC4.23, the effective interest method is not appropriate for measuring contractual cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest, but instead those cash flows require a valuation overlay to contractual cash flows (ie fair value) to ensure that the reported financial information is relevant and useful.
BC4.190 In particular, the IASB noted that contingently convertible instruments and bail-in instruments could give rise to contractual cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest and indeed are structured for regulatory purposes such that they have contractual characteristics similar to equity instruments in particular circumstances.
Consequently, the IASB believes that amortised cost does not provide relevant or useful information to users of financial statements about those financial instruments, in particular if the likelihood of that future event occurring increases.
At a minimum, the IASB observed that it would be necessary to reclassify the financial asset so that it is measured at fair value through profit or loss if the future event becomes more likely than remote.
BC4.191 However, the IASB acknowledged that, as the result of legislation, some governments or other authorities have the power in particular circumstances to impose losses on the holders of some financial instruments.
In other words, the holder would not consider the payments that arise only as a result of the government's or other authority's legislative power as cash flows in its analysis.
That is because that power and the related payments are not contractual terms of the financial instrument.
BC4.192 Moreover, the IASB decided to provide a narrow exception for particular prepayable financial assets.
The exception would apply to financial assets that would otherwise have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest but do not meet that condition only as a result of the prepayment feature.
the financial asset is purchased or originated at a premium or discount to the contractual par amount;
the prepayment amount substantially represents the contractual par amount and accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest, which may include reasonable additional compensation for the early termination of the contract; and
the fair value of the prepayment feature on initial recognition of the financial asset is insignificant.
In particular, the IASB observed that this exception will apply to many purchased credit-impaired financial assets with contractual prepayment features.
If such an asset was purchased at a deep discount, apart from the exception described in paragraph BC4.192, the contractual cash flows would not be solely payments of principal and interest if, contractually, the asset could be repaid immediately at the par amount.
However that contractual prepayment feature would have an insignificant fair value if it is very unlikely that prepayment will occur.
The IASB was persuaded by the feedback that stated that amortised cost would provide useful and relevant information to users of financial statements about such financial assets, because the exception applies only to those financial assets that are prepayable at the contractual par amount.
The IASB believes that information about that variability would be appropriately captured by amortised cost via the catch-up adjustment mechanism.
For example, this scenario may arise when an entity sells an item (for example, an automobile) and, as a marketing incentive, provides financing to the customer at an interest rate that is below the prevailing market rate.
If the customer has a contractual right to repay the par amount at any point before maturity, then without an exception, the contractual cash flows may not be solely payments of principal and interest.
The IASB observed that such a contractual prepayment feature likely would have an insignificant fair value because it is unlikely that the customer will choose to prepay; in particular, because the interest rate is below-market and thus the financing is advantageous.
Consistently with the discussion in paragraph BC4.193, the IASB believes that amortised cost would provide relevant and useful information to users of financial statements about this financial asset, because the prepayment amount does not introduce variability that is inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement.
However, the IASB noted that its rationale for the exception described in paragraph BC4.192 is equally relevant for assets that are originated or purchased at a premium and therefore decided that the exception should apply symmetrically to both circumstances.
That feedback is summarised in paragraph BC4.88.
In addition, some have noted that
components of some hybrid financial assets are managed separately and therefore bifurcation may provide more relevant information to users of financial statements about how the entity manages those instruments;
an embedded feature that has an insignificant fair value at initial recognition (for example, because it is contingent on a future event that the entity believes is unlikely to occur) could cause a hybrid financial asset to be measured at fair value through profit or loss in its entirety; and
no bifurcation (ie the financial instrument would be classified in its entirety).
As a result, hybrid financial assets are not bifurcated but are instead classified and measured in their entirety.
For example, the IASB discussed a scenario in which a financial asset had contractual cash flows that were not solely payments of principal and interest but did not contain an embedded derivative that required bifurcation.
Similar challenges would arise for a financial asset that had contractual cash flows that were solely payments of principal and interest but contained an embedded derivative that required bifurcation.
Consequently, the IASB decided not to pursue this approach for financial assets.
BC4.201 Under a principal-and-interest bifurcation approach, if a financial asset had cash flows that were not solely payments of principal and interest, that asset would be assessed to determine whether it should be bifurcated into a host (with cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest) and an embedded residual feature.
The IASB also considered variations of this approach whereby bifurcation would be required only if the embedded feature met the definition of a derivative or if the components were separately managed.
If these conditions were not met, the financial asset would be measured in its entirety at fair value through profit or loss.
The IASB also noted that a principal-and-interest bifurcation approach might seem generally compatible with the existing requirements in IFRS 9, but, in fact, it would introduce new concepts into the classification and measurement of financial assets and would undoubtedly raise questions about how the host and embedded feature should be defined and measured.
The IASB also observed that there was significant risk of unintended consequences related to introducing a new bifurcation approach.
In reaching that conclusion, the IASB cited its original rationale for prohibiting bifurcation, which is set out in paragraphs BC4.83–BC4.90.
However, most respondents did not suggest that bifurcation should be reintroduced and some respondents specifically stated that they disagreed with reintroducing it.
the contractual terms of the tranche being assessed for classification give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding;
the underlying pool of instruments contains only instruments that have contractual cash flows that are solely principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, that reduce cash flow variability on the instruments in the pool or that align the cash flows of the tranches with the cash flows of the instruments in the pool to address particular differences; and
the exposure to credit risk inherent in the tranche being assessed is equal to, or lower than, the overall exposure to credit risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments.
The IASB noted that a key principle underpinning the assessment of contractually linked instruments is that an entity should not be disadvantaged simply as a result of holding an investment indirectly (ie via an investment in a tranche) if the underlying pool of instruments have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest and the tranche is not exposed to leverage or more credit risk than the credit risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments.
the tranche is prepayable in the event that the underlying pool of financial instruments is prepaid.
The IASB noted that because the underlying pool of assets must have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest then, by extension, any prepayment features in those underlying financial assets must also be solely payments of principal and interest.
In such cases, the entity would disregard the possibility that the pool may contain the collateral in the future unless the entity acquired the instrument with the intention of controlling the collateral.
BC4.208 The IASB agreed with the points in paragraph BC4.207 and indeed noted that those clarifications are consistent with the original intention of the requirements for contractually linked instruments.
Fair value option for financial assets otherwise measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Such designation is available at initial recognition and is irrevocable.
BC4.211 The IASB decided that the same fair value option that is available to financial assets that would otherwise be measured at amortised cost should be available for financial assets that would otherwise be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
The IASB noted that the rationale set out in paragraph BC4.79 for permitting the fair value option for assets measured at amortised cost is equally applicable for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
Reclassifications into and out of the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category
Paragraphs BC4.111–BC4.120 set out the IASB's rationale for the reclassification requirements.
Consequently, when an entity changes its business model for managing financial assets, it must reclassify all affected financial assets, including those in the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category.
BC4.214 The IASB noted that because amortised cost information is provided in profit or loss for financial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, reclassifications between the amortised cost measurement category and the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category do not change the recognition of interest revenue or the measurement of expected credit losses.
Specifically, the entity would have established the effective interest rate when the financial asset was originally recognised and would continue to use that rate if the financial asset is reclassified between the amortised cost measurement category and the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category.
Similarly, the measurement of expected credit losses does not change because both measurement categories apply the same impairment approach.
Such a prepayment amount would, in effect, include an amount that reflects a payment to the borrower from the lender, instead of compensation from the borrower to the lender, even though the borrower chose to prepay the debt instrument.
As a result of those amendments, particular financial assets with prepayment features that may result in reasonable negative compensation for the early termination of the contract are eligible to be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income.
Accordingly, that paragraph already accommodates a prepayment amount that is more or less than unpaid amounts of principal and interest, depending on which party chooses to terminate the contract early.
In applying the effective interest method to measure such financial assets at amortised cost, an entity considers the contractual cash flows arising from such a prepayment feature when it estimates the future cash flows and determines the effective interest rate at initial recognition.
However, the difference is that such a prepayment feature may have the result that the party that triggers the early termination of the contract may, in effect, receive an amount from the other party, rather than pay compensation to the other party.
To illustrate this difference, the IASB considered a loan with a prepayment feature that may result in negative compensation.
Specifically, both the borrower and the lender have the option to terminate the loan before maturity and, if the loan is terminated early, the prepayment amount includes compensation that reflects the change in the relevant benchmark interest rate.
That is, if the loan is terminated early (by either party) and the relevant benchmark interest rate has fallen since the loan was initially recognised, then the lender will effectively receive an amount representing the present value of that lost interest revenue over the loan's remaining term.
Specifically, the loan's prepayment amount reflects unpaid amounts of principal and interest plus or minus an amount that reflects the effect of the change in the relevant benchmark interest rate.
BC4.226 The IASB noted that from a computation standpoint, the effective interest method, and thus amortised cost measurement, could be applied to the contractual cash flows that arise from a prepayable financial asset like the loan described in paragraph BC4.224.
As described in paragraph BC4.223, the entity would consider the prepayment feature when it estimates the future cash flows and determines the effective interest rate.
Specifically, they agreed that reasonable negative compensation for the early termination of the contract should not in itself preclude amortised cost measurement.
The respondents agreed with the IASB's rationale described in paragraphs BC4.226–BC4.227 and they also agreed that the proposed eligibility condition would capture a population of financial assets for which amortised cost measurement could provide useful information to users of financial statements.
The respondents said that measuring such assets at amortised cost, and including them in key metrics like net interest margin, would provide useful information to users of financial statements about the financial assets' performance.
That respondent asked the IASB to clarify the amendments in that regard.
The IASB agreed with that observation.
Consequently, the wording in paragraph B4.1.12A of the amendments refers to the event or circumstance that caused the early termination of the contract.
The IASB observed that the effective interest method, and thus amortised cost measurement, are not appropriate when the prepayment amount is inconsistent with that paragraph for any other reason.
The IASB is also aware that some financial assets are prepayable at an amount that includes the fair value cost to terminate an associated hedging instrument (which may or may not be in a hedging relationship with the prepayable financial asset for accounting purposes).
Some interested parties suggested that both of those types of prepayable financial asset should be eligible for amortised cost measurement.
For example, that may be the case when the calculation of the prepayment amount is intended to approximate unpaid amounts of principal and interest plus or minus an amount that reflects the effect of the change in the relevant benchmark interest rate.
However, the Board observed that it will not always be the case and therefore an entity cannot presume that all such prepayable financial assets are eligible to be measured at amortised cost.
Entities must assess an instrument's specific contractual cash flow characteristics.
BC4.233 A prepayment feature that may result in negative compensation changes the circumstances, and increases the frequency, in which the contractual compensation amounts could arise.
This could include adjustments to reflect circumstances in which the lender is forced to settle the contract in a way that it would not recover its investment for reasons other than the asset's credit quality.
The IASB observed that recognising frequent upward and downward adjustments in the gross carrying amount is generally inconsistent with the objective of the effective interest method, which is a relatively simple measurement technique that allocates interest using the effective interest rate over the relevant time period.
Recognising more frequent adjustments in the gross carrying amount could reduce the usefulness of the interest amounts that are calculated using such a simple measurement technique and could suggest that fair value measurement would provide more useful information.
That eligibility condition would have required that the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant when the entity initially recognises the financial asset.
The objective of that proposed eligibility condition was to limit further the scope of the amendments so that financial assets would be eligible to be measured at amortised cost only if it is unlikely that prepayment, and thus negative compensation, would occur.
BC4.235 While some respondents agreed with that proposed eligibility condition, others disagreed and expressed concerns about matters such as how difficult the condition would be to apply, whether it would unduly restrict the scope of the amendments and whether it would achieve the IASB's stated objective.
Some respondents suggested alternatives that they thought would better achieve the IASB's objective.
Those suggestions included assessing the probability that prepayment, or negative compensation, will occur.
That is because the fair value of the prepayment feature would take into account the likelihood that prepayment will occur.
Accordingly, if it is very unlikely that prepayment will occur, then the fair value of the prepayment feature will be insignificant.
BC4.237 However, the IASB acknowledged the concerns expressed by respondents.
BC4.238 The IASB also noted concerns that the fair value of the prepayment feature could be insignificant even if it is likely that negative compensation may occur.
Corresponding amendment to paragraph B4.1.12
As a result, paragraph B4.1.12(b) also accommodates reasonable negative compensation for the early termination of the contract.
Additionally, some jurisdictions will need time for translation and endorsement activities and the proposed effective date may not provide them with sufficient time for those activities.
No specific transition provisions are needed for the amendments.
However, in some circumstances, an entity may not be able to apply the amendments retrospectively without the use of hindsight.
When the IASB developed the transition requirements in IFRS 9, it provided requirements to address scenarios when it would be impracticable to apply particular requirements retrospectively.
Therefore, an entity is permitted to newly designate, and is required to revoke its previous designation of, a financial asset or a financial liability at the date of initial application of the amendments only to the extent that a new accounting mismatch is created, or a previous accounting mismatch no longer exists, as a result of applying the amendments.
Modification or exchange of a financial liability that does not result in derecognition
More specifically, at the request of the Interpretations Committee, the Board discussed whether, applying IFRS 9, an entity recognises any adjustment to the amortised cost of the financial liability arising from such a modification or exchange in profit or loss at the date of the modification or exchange.
The IASB decided that it is desirable to provide clear and reasonably detailed guidance about the objective and use of valuation techniques to achieve reliable and comparable fair value estimates when financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Use of quoted prices in active markets
Some respondents argued that (a) valuation techniques are more appropriate for measuring fair value than a quoted price in an active market (eg for derivatives) and (b) valuation models are consistent with industry best practice, and are justified because of their acceptance for regulatory capital purposes.
The IASB further clarified that a quoted price includes market-quoted rates as well as prices.
BCZ5.4 The IASB considered situations in which entities operate in different markets.
An example is a trader that originates a derivative with a corporate in an active corporate retail market and offsets the derivative by taking out a derivative with a dealer in an active dealers' wholesale market.
Thus, if a dealer enters into a derivative instrument with the corporate, but has immediate access to a more advantageously priced dealers' market, the entity recognises a profit on initial recognition of the derivative instrument.
However, the entity adjusts the price observed in the dealer market for any differences in counterparty credit risk between the derivative instrument with the corporate and that with the dealers' market.
BCZ5.6 The IASB discussed whether the bid-ask spread should be applied to the net open position of a portfolio containing offsetting market risk positions, or to each instrument in the portfolio.
It noted the concerns raised by constituents that applying the bid-ask spread to the net open position better reflects the fair value of the risk retained in the portfolio.
The IASB concluded that for offsetting risk positions, entities could use mid-market prices to determine fair value, and hence may apply the bid or asking price to the net open position as appropriate.
BCZ5.10 The IASB also considered constituents' comments regarding whether an instrument should always be recognised on initial recognition at the transaction price or whether gains or losses may be recognised on initial recognition when an entity uses a valuation technique to estimate fair value.
The IASB concluded that an entity may recognise a gain or loss at inception only if fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (ie without modification or repackaging) or is based on a valuation technique incorporating only observable market data.
The IASB concluded that those conditions were necessary and sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that fair value was other than the transaction price for the purpose of recognising upfront gains or losses.
BC5.13 The IASB believes that measurement at amortised cost is not applicable to equity investments because such financial assets have no contractual cash flows and hence there are no contractual cash flows to amortise.
Those equity investments were required to be measured at cost less impairment, if any.
Impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
Cost provides little, if any, information with predictive value about the timing, amount and uncertainty of the future cash flows arising from the instrument.
In many cases, fair value will differ significantly from historical cost (this is particularly true for derivatives measured at cost under the exception).
Calculating any impairment loss is similar to determining fair value (ie the estimated future cash flows are discounted using the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset and compared with the carrying amount).
Some of those respondents generally agreed with the removal of the exception, but suggested that disclosures would have to include information about the uncertainties surrounding measurement.
BC5.16 However, many respondents (mainly preparers from non-financial entities and some auditors) disagreed with the proposal to eliminate the current cost exception on the grounds of the reliability and usefulness of fair value measurement and the cost and difficulty involved in determining fair value on a recurring basis.
Some noted that the proposals would not reduce complexity, because they would increase complexity in measurement.
Furthermore, a few believed that cost could provide useful information if the financial asset is held for the long term.
BC5.17 The IASB considered those arguments as follows
They believed that, given the lack of available reliable information, any fair value measurement would require significant management judgement or might be impossible.
They also believed that comparability would be impaired by the requirement to measure such equity instruments at fair value.
However, those respondents had considered the question of reliability of fair value for the instruments concerned in isolation.
Thus, cost is a reliable (and objective) amount, but has little, if any, relevance.
In the IASB's view measuring all equity instruments at fair value, including those that are currently measured using the cost exception in IAS 39, meets the criteria in the Framework for information to be reliable if appropriate measurement techniques and inputs are employed.
Many respondents, particularly in emerging economies, said that they faced difficulty in obtaining information that might be relied on to use in valuation.
Others said that they would inevitably rely heavily on external experts at significant cost.
Many questioned whether the requirement to determine fair value on a recurring basis would involve significant costs and efforts that are not offset by the incremental benefit to usefulness from fair value.
The IASB considered the costs of requiring such equity investments to be measured at fair value from the perspectives of valuation methodology and expertise, as well as the ability to obtain the information required for a fair value measurement.
The IASB noted that valuation methods for equity investments are well-developed and are often far less complex than those required for other financial instruments that are required to be measured at fair value, including many complex derivative products.
Although some expressed concern that smaller entities applying IFRS might not have internal systems or expertise to determine easily the fair value of equity investments held, the IASB noted that basic shareholder rights generally enable an entity to obtain the necessary information to perform a valuation.
The IASB acknowledged that there are circumstances in which the cost of determining fair value could outweigh the benefits from fair value measurement.
In particular, the IASB noted that, in some jurisdictions, entities hold high numbers of unquoted equity instruments that are currently accounted for under the cost exception and the value of a single investment is considered low.
BC5.18 The IASB noted that there are some circumstances in which cost might be representative of fair value and decided to provide additional application guidance on those circumstances to alleviate some of the concerns expressed.
However, the IASB also noted that those circumstances would never apply to equity investments held by particular entities such as financial institutions and investment funds.
The IASB also discussed possible simplified measurement approaches, including management's best estimate of the price it would accept to sell or buy the instrument, or changes in the share of net assets.
However, the IASB concluded that a simplified measurement approach would add complexity to the classification approach and reduce the usefulness of information to users of financial statements.
Those disadvantages would not be offset by the benefit of reduced cost to preparers of financial statements.
Elimination of the cost exception for particular derivative liabilities
The IASB noted that in particular circumstances a puttable instrument (or an instrument that imposes on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation) is classified as equity.
However, the IASB noted that such instruments do not meet the definition of an equity instrument.
BC5.22 In the IASB's view, fair value provides the most useful information about investments in equity instruments to users of financial statements.
However, the IASB noted arguments that presenting fair value gains and losses in profit or loss for some equity investments may not be indicative of the performance of the entity, particularly if the entity holds those equity instruments for non-contractual benefits, rather than primarily for increases in the value of the investment.
An example could be a requirement to hold such an investment if an entity sells its products in a particular country.
BC5.23 The IASB also noted that, in their valuation of an entity, users of financial statements often differentiate between fair value changes arising from equity investments held for purposes other than generating investment returns and equity investments held for trading.
Thus, the IASB believes that separate presentation in other comprehensive income of gains and losses for some investments could provide useful information to users of financial statements because it would allow them to identify easily, and value accordingly, the associated fair value changes.
They agreed that an entity should make an irrevocable election to identify those equity instruments.
Nearly all respondents objected to that proposal.
As a result, presenting dividends in other comprehensive income would create a 'mismatch'.
Some listed investment funds stated that without recognising dividend income in profit or loss their financial statements would become meaningless to their investors.
The IASB agreed with those arguments.
The IASB noted that structuring opportunities might remain because dividends could represent a return of investment, instead of a return on investment.
Consequently, the IASB decided that dividends that clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment are not recognised in profit or loss.
Those respondents supported an approach that maintains a distinction between realised and unrealised gains and losses and said that an entity's performance should include all realised gains and losses.
However, the IASB concluded that a gain or loss on those investments should be recognised once only; therefore, recognising a gain or loss in other comprehensive income and subsequently transferring it to profit or loss is inappropriate.
That would not significantly improve or reduce the complexity of the financial reporting for financial assets.
Accordingly, the IASB decided to prohibit recycling of gains and losses into profit or loss when an equity instrument is derecognised.
However, they did not specify what that principle should be.
The IASB previously considered developing a principle to identify other equity investments whose fair value changes should be presented in profit or loss (or other comprehensive income), including a distinction based on whether the equity instruments represented a 'strategic investment'.
However, the IASB decided that it would be difficult, and perhaps impossible, to develop a clear and robust principle that would identify investments that are different enough to justify a different presentation requirement.
The IASB considered whether a list of indicators could be used to support the principle, but decided that such a list would inevitably be rule-based and could not be comprehensive enough to address all possible situations and factors.
Moreover, the IASB noted that such an approach would create complexity in application without necessarily increasing the usefulness of information to users of financial statements.
However, the IASB decided that the option must be irrevocable to provide discipline to its application.
The IASB also noted that the option to designate a financial asset as measured at fair value is also irrevocable.
BC5.26 An entity may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
In the light of jurisdiction-specific restrictions on components of equity, the IASB decided not to provide specific requirements related to that transfer.
The IASB believes those disclosures will provide useful information to users of financial statements about instruments presented in that manner and the effect of that presentation.
BC5.28 The IASB noted that permitting an option for entities to present some gains and losses in other comprehensive income is an exception to the overall classification and measurement approach and adds complexity.
However, the IASB believes that the requirement that the election is irrevocable, together with the additional disclosures required, addresses many of those concerns.
Liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss
Previous discussions related to the effects of changes in a liability's credit risk
Commentators noted that it is not useful to report lower liabilities when an entity is in financial difficulty precisely because its debt levels are too high, and that it would be difficult to explain to users of financial statements the reasons why income would be recognised when a liability's creditworthiness deteriorates.
These comments suggested that fair value should exclude the effects of changes in the instrument's credit risk.
Accordingly, the fair value of a financial liability reflects the credit risk relating to that liability.
Consequently, it decided to include credit risk relating to a financial liability in the fair value measurement of that liability for the following reasons
The IASB believes that it is inappropriate to include credit risk in the initial fair value measurement of financial liabilities, but not subsequently.
The IASB decided that whilst separately presenting or disclosing such changes might be difficult in practice, disclosure of such information would be useful to users of financial statements and would help alleviate the concerns expressed.
Consequently, it decided to require a disclosure to help identify the changes in the fair value of a financial liability that arise from changes in the liability's credit risk.
The IASB believes this is a reasonable proxy for the change in fair value that is attributable to changes in the liability's credit risk, in particular when such changes are large, and will provide users with information with which to understand the profit or loss effect of such a change in credit risk.
BCZ5.33 The IASB decided to clarify that this issue relates to the credit risk of the financial liability, instead of the creditworthiness of the entity.
The IASB noted that this more appropriately describes the objective of what is included in the fair value measurement of financial liabilities.
However, many users and others told the IASB over a long period of time that changes in a liability's credit risk ought not to affect profit or loss unless the liability is held for trading.
The IASB acknowledged that this might be the case if an entity holds large portfolios of financial assets that are measured at fair value through profit or loss and there is an economic relationship between changes in the fair value of those assets and the effects of changes in the credit risk of the financial liabilities designated under the fair value option.
A mismatch would arise because the entire change in the fair value of the assets would be presented in profit or loss but only a portion of the change in the fair value of the liabilities would be presented in profit or loss.
The portion of the liabilities' fair value change attributable to changes in their credit risk would be presented in other comprehensive income.
The IASB asked respondents for feedback on the alternative approach.
However, those respondents said that if such treatment would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss, the entire fair value change should be presented in profit or loss.
Respondents thought such cases would be rare and asked the IASB to provide guidance on how to determine whether presenting the effects of changes in credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.
Consequently, entities are required to present the effects of changes in the liabilities' credit risk in other comprehensive income unless such treatment would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss (in which case, the entire fair value change is required to be presented in profit or loss).
The IASB acknowledged that that approach will introduce some additional complexity to financial reporting because not all liabilities designated under the fair value option will be treated the same.
However, the IASB decided that it was necessary to address circumstances in which the proposals would create or enlarge a mismatch in profit or loss.
Although the IASB expects those circumstances to be rare, they could be significant in some industries in some jurisdictions.
BC5.40 The IASB discussed how an entity should determine whether a mismatch would be created or enlarged.
It decided that an entity has to assess whether it expects that changes in the credit risk of a liability will be offset by changes in the fair value of another financial instrument.
The IASB decided that such an assessment must be based on an economic relationship between the characteristics of the liability and the characteristics of the other financial instrument.
Such a relationship does not arise by coincidence.
BC5.41 The IASB believes that in many cases the relationship will be contractual (as described in paragraph B5.7.10 of IFRS 9) but decided that a contractual relationship is not required.
Requiring a contractual relationship would have created a very high threshold for presenting the effects of changes in a liability's credit risk in profit or loss and the IASB decided that such a high threshold was too strict to accommodate all of the possible scenarios in which a mismatch would be created or enlarged by presenting those amounts in other comprehensive income.
Also, an entity is required to apply its methodology consistently.
The determination must be made at initial recognition of the liability and is not reassessed, which is consistent with the entity's overall election to use the fair value option.
Those respondents suggested that the proposals should not apply to those items because the IASB's intention seemingly had always been to address the issue of own credit risk for non-derivative liabilities.
The respondents noted that loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts either meet the definition of a derivative or are very similar to a derivative from an economic perspective and therefore changes in their fair value should always be presented in profit or loss.
The IASB agreed with those respondents and decided that all changes in the fair value of loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts designated under the fair value option should be presented in profit or loss.
Alternative approaches to address the issue of own credit risk
If those amounts were presented directly in equity, they would never be presented in the entity's statement of comprehensive income.
The IASB acknowledged that IFRS does not provide a clear objective for when an item should be presented in other comprehensive income instead of in profit or loss or whether the amounts in other comprehensive income should be reclassified to profit or loss.
The IASB noted that remeasurements of assets and liabilities should not be presented directly in equity because remeasurements are not transactions with equity holders.
Accordingly the IASB did not pursue this alternative.
They argue that this approach would avoid the difficult question of how to measure the effects of changes in credit risk.
The IASB rejected this approach because it believes that at least some of the change in fair value should be presented in profit or loss.
The IASB's objective was to address issues related to the effects of changes in liabilities' credit risk; therefore, presenting the entire change in fair value in other comprehensive income is not appropriate.
Also, this approach would result in mismatches in profit or loss because changes in the fair value of an entity's assets would be presented in profit or loss and changes in the fair value of its liabilities would be presented in other comprehensive income (see similar discussion in paragraph BC5.37).
Moreover, this alternative would raise difficult questions about what (if any) amounts should be presented in profit or loss during the life of the liability (eg interest or other financing costs).
The IASB has discussed the topic of disaggregating finance costs from other fair value changes on numerous occasions without reaching any conclusions.
All other portions of the fair value change would be presented in profit or loss.
That exposure draft proposes that the profit or loss section and other comprehensive income should be displayed as separate components within an overall statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Some users noted that the effects of changes in a liability's credit risk should not be presented in profit or loss, even if those effects were subsequently backed out.
Reclassifying amounts to profit or loss
Consequently, for many liabilities, the issue of reclassification is irrelevant.
They acknowledged that there would not be any amount to reclassify if the entity repays the contractual amount.
But they believe that if the entity repays an amount other than the contractual amount, the realised amounts in other comprehensive income should be reclassified.
Those respondents view other comprehensive income as a 'temporary holding place' for unrealised gains and losses.
They believe that unrealised and realised amounts are fundamentally different and thus should not be treated the same.
The former are still uncertain and may never be crystallised.
In contrast, the latter have crystallised and are backed by cash flows.
BC5.55 However, the IASB was not persuaded and confirmed the proposal to prohibit reclassification.
The IASB acknowledged that it needs to address the overall objective of other comprehensive income, including when an item should be presented in other comprehensive income instead of in profit or loss and whether amounts in other comprehensive income should be reclassified to profit or loss (and if so, when).
Determining the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk
If the only relevant changes in market conditions for the liability are changes in an observed (benchmark) interest rate, that method attributes all changes in fair value, other than changes in the benchmark interest rate, to changes in the credit risk of the liability.
In the Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 7, the IASB acknowledged that quantifying the change in a liability's credit risk might be difficult in practice.
It noted that it believes that the default method provides a reasonable proxy for changes in the liability's credit risk, in particular when such changes are large, and would provide users with information with which to understand the effect on profit or loss of such a change in credit risk.
Most users said that it was an appropriate method.
Many users noted the difficulty in determining that amount more precisely.
Under the proposals, the default method would be carried forward but entities would continue to be permitted to use a different method if it provides a more faithful representation of the amount of the change in fair value that is attributable to changes in the liability's credit risk.
They noted that determining the effects of changes in a liability's credit risk can be complex, and therefore it was necessary to allow some flexibility in how it is measured.
Moreover, although some respondents acknowledged that the default method does not isolate changes in a liability's credit risk from some other changes in fair value (eg general changes in the price of credit or changes in liquidity risk), those respondents said that it is often very difficult or impossible to separate those items.
However, to respond to some of the questions raised in the comment letters, the IASB decided to clarify the difference between the creditworthiness of the entity and the credit risk of a liability.
Moreover, the IASB addressed the difference between a liability's credit risk and asset-specific performance risk — and confirmed that a change in a liability's credit risk does not include changes in asset-specific performance risk.
Furthermore, the IASB noted that in some cases a liability might not have credit risk.
If that is not the case, an entity is required to use a more precise method.
Moreover, an entity is always permitted to use a different method if that method more faithfully represents the effects of changes in a liability's credit risk.
BCZ5.66 The IASB noted that future cash flows and the expected life can be reliably estimated for most financial assets and financial liabilities, in particular for a group of similar financial assets or similar financial liabilities.
However, the IASB acknowledged that in some rare cases it might not be possible to estimate the timing or amount of future cash flows reliably.
It therefore decided to require that if it is not possible to estimate reliably the future cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument, the entity should use contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument.
If an entity does not take into account such credit losses in the calculation of the effective interest rate, the entity would recognise a higher interest income than that inherent in the price paid.
The IASB therefore decided to clarify that such credit losses are included in the estimated cash flows when computing the effective interest rate.
In particular, it was not always clear whether fees, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts included in the calculation of the effective interest rate should be amortised over the period until maturity or the period to the next market-based repricing date.
A shorter period is used when the variable (eg interest rates) to which the fee, transaction costs, discount or premium relates is repriced to market rates before the expected maturity of the instrument.
It related to whether the revised or the original effective interest rate of a debt instrument should be applied when remeasuring the instrument's carrying amount on the cessation of fair value hedge accounting.
A revised effective interest rate is calculated when fair value hedge accounting ceases.
Consequently, interest revenue would have represented the economic yield, or the effective return, on those financial assets.
Under this approach, an entity recognises interest on the gross carrying amount of a financial asset without taking expected credit losses into consideration (except when financial assets become credit-impaired or are credit-impaired on initial recognition).
In addition, users of financial statements stressed the need for an interest revenue recognition model that allows them to continue to analyse net interest margin and credit losses separately.
However, the IASB noted that there are some financial assets for which credit risk has increased to such an extent that presenting interest revenue on the basis of the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, that reflects the contractual return, would no longer faithfully represent the economic return.
These requirements only affect the calculation and presentation of interest revenue and not the measurement of the loss allowance.
BC5.76 The IASB acknowledged the concerns of using 'incurred loss' criteria in a model based on expected credit losses.
However, in the IASB's view, it was necessary to retain the faithful representation of interest revenue, while minimising the operational challenges of requiring entities to calculate interest revenue on the amortised cost amount for all financial assets.
BC5.78 The IASB is of the view that, conceptually, an entity should assess whether financial assets have become credit-impaired on an ongoing basis, thus altering the presentation of interest revenue as the underlying economics change.
However, the IASB noted that such an approach would be unduly onerous for preparers to apply.
Thus, the IASB decided that an entity should be required to make the assessment of whether a financial asset is credit-impaired at the reporting date and then change the interest calculation from the beginning of the following reporting period.
In accordance with such an approach an entity would be required to offset interest revenue on a subset of financial assets with an equal amount of expected credit losses.
The IASB noted that an advantage of presenting nil interest revenue is the operational simplicity.
However, the IASB noted that such an approach would blend together the effect of the unwinding of the present value of expected cash flows with other expected credit losses.
In the IASB's view, a nil interest approach would not improve the calculation of interest revenue, because it would not faithfully represent the economic return in a manner that is consistent with the measurement of the gross carrying amount and expected credit losses at a present value.
BC5.80 Consequently, the IASB decided to confirm the requirement to present interest revenue on a net basis and to do so from the beginning of the reporting period following the reporting period when the financial instrument became credit-impaired.
The definition is also necessary for the newly introduced disclosure requirements about expected credit losses.
Objectives for depicting expected credit losses
BC5.82 For financial assets measured at amortised cost and debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income the effect of changes in credit risk are more relevant to an investor's understanding of the likelihood of the collection of future contractual cash flows than the effects of other changes, such as changes in market interest rates.
This is because an integral aspect of both business models is to collect contractual cash flows.
BC5.83 The IASB noted that a model that faithfully represents the economic phenomenon of expected credit losses should provide users of financial statements with relevant information about the amount, timing and uncertainty of an entity's future cash flows.
It should also ensure that the amounts that an entity reports are comparable, timely and understandable.
Consequently, no economic loss is suffered at initial recognition simply because the credit risk on a financial instrument is high at that time, because those expected credit losses are implicit in the initial pricing of the instrument.
Consequently, subsequent changes in expected credit losses are economic losses (or gains) of the entity in the period in which they occur.
BC5.85 Expected credit losses, in isolation, are not directly observable.
A number of models exist to assist market participants and regulators in the measurement of expected credit losses.
But, because expected credit losses are not directly observable, their measurement is inherently based on judgement and any model that attempts to depict expected credit losses will be subject to measurement uncertainty.
BC5.86 Some interested parties would prefer an impairment model that results in a more conservative, or prudential, depiction of expected credit losses.
Those interested parties argue that such a depiction would better meet the needs of both the regulators who are responsible for maintaining financial stability and investors and other users of financial statements.
In the IASB's view, incorporating a degree of conservatism would be arbitrary and would result in a lack of comparability.
The risk of an outcome other than the probability-weighted expected outcome is only relevant for particular purposes, such as determining the extent of economic or regulatory capital requirements.
Alternative models considered to depict expected credit losses
The IASB was aware that these proposals were a fundamentally new approach to impairment accounting for financial reporting purposes that was much more closely linked to credit risk management concepts.
the initial expected credit losses over the life of the asset through the credit-adjusted effective interest rate; and
any changes in expected credit losses when those changes occurred.
BC5.89 Users of financial statements have told the IASB that they support a model that distinguishes between the effect of initial estimates of expected credit losses and subsequent changes in those estimates.
They noted that such a distinction would provide useful information about changes in credit risk and the resulting economic losses.
estimating the full expected cash flows for all financial instruments;
applying a credit-adjusted effective interest rate to those cash flow estimates; and
maintaining information about the initial estimate of expected credit losses.
BC5.90 These operational challenges arose because entities typically operate separate accounting and credit risk management systems.
Respondents noted that these operational challenges would be especially acute for open portfolios (ie portfolios to which new financial instruments are added over time).
BC5.92 To address the operational challenges outlined in paragraph BC5.89 and as suggested by the EAP, the IASB decided to decouple the measurement and allocation of initial expected credit losses from the determination of the effective interest rate (except for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets).
Thus, an entity would measure the financial asset and the loss allowance separately using the original effective interest rate (ie not adjusted for initial expected credit losses).
This presents a dilemma, because measuring expected credit losses using such a rate double-counts the expected credit losses that were priced into the financial asset at initial recognition.
The IASB therefore concluded that recognising the lifetime expected credit losses from initial recognition would be inappropriate under a model that discounts expected credit losses using the original effective interest rate.
Such a dual-measurement model would require an entity to recognise
a portion of the lifetime expected credit losses from initial recognition as a proxy for recognising the initial expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset; and
the lifetime expected credit losses when credit risk has increased since initial recognition (ie when the recognition of only a portion of the lifetime expected credit losses is no longer appropriate because the entity has suffered a significant economic loss).
BC5.94 The IASB considered the interaction between the timing of the recognition of the full lifetime expected credit losses, and the size of the portion of the lifetime expected credit losses that are recognised before that, to be a determinant of what would provide a more faithful representation of the economic loss.
Thus, if an entity recognises a smaller portion of the lifetime expected credit losses initially, it should recognise the full lifetime expected credit losses earlier than if it had been required to recognise a larger portion of the lifetime expected credit losses initially.
Furthermore, while there is always recognition of some expected credit losses, such a model retains a criterion for when lifetime expected credit losses are recognised.
Once that criterion is met, the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses results in a loss representing the difference between the portion that was recognised previously and the lifetime expected credit losses (a 'cliff effect').
The model proposed in the Supplementary Document
If applying a TPA, an entity would recognise the lifetime expected credit losses over the weighted average life of the portfolio of assets.
the lifetime expected credit losses for the bad book.
Financial assets would be moved to the bad book if the collectability of contractual cash flows on a financial asset became so uncertain that the entity's credit risk management objective changes from receiving the regular payments to recovery of all, or a portion of, the asset.
Because the TPA allocates both the initial expected credit losses and the subsequent changes in lifetime expected credit losses over time, the measurement results in an understatement of changes in expected credit losses until the entity recognises lifetime expected credit losses.
This effect is particularly problematic for financial assets that increase in credit risk and thus whose expected credit losses increase early in the asset's life.
This shortcoming was addressed by including a foreseeable future floor in the SD.
However, because the calculation of the TPA relied on the weighted average age over the weighted average life of the portfolio, the outcome may not have reflected the economics of a growing or declining portfolio.
BC5.99 The TPA calculation proposed by the Supplementary Document (whereby the loss allowance was, at a minimum, equal to the expected credit losses in the foreseeable future) was unique and would not be a calculation required to be used by entities for other purposes.
BC5.100 The IASB did not receive strong support for the proposals in the Supplementary Document.
They viewed the dual calculation as operationally difficult, lacking conceptual merit and providing confusing information to users of financial statements, because the basis for these loss calculations could change over time for the same financial assets and be different for different financial assets.
Respondents also expressed concerns about the calculation of expected credit losses for the foreseeable future, with many expressing confusion about the conceptual basis for the time period.
Many also noted that the term 'foreseeable future' had not been sufficiently defined to ensure consistent application.
Furthermore, feedback on the Supplementary Document proposals were geographically split, with respondents in the US generally preferring the foreseeable future floor while respondents outside the US generally preferred the TPA approach.
BC5.101 Although the IASB did not receive strong support for the proposals in the Supplementary Document, some respondents, particularly users of financial statements and prudential regulators, supported the distinction between 'good book' and 'bad book' assets even if they were concerned that the criteria for transferring from the 'good book' to the 'bad book' were not sufficiently clear.
the expected credit losses for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses, if the credit quality on that financial instrument has decreased significantly (or the credit risk increases significantly) since initial recognition; and
The proposed simplifications would reduce the need to track increases in credit risk by requiring (or allowing) an entity to recognise lifetime expected credit losses from the date of initial recognition.
In the IASB's view, this requirement for recognising lifetime expected credit losses strikes the best balance between the benefits of making distinctions on the basis of an increase in credit risk and the costs and complexity of making that assessment.
Furthermore, the proposals aimed to limit the new information that an entity would be required to capture and maintain about the initial credit risk of financial assets by using information that preparers have said is consistent with current credit risk management systems.
Joint deliberations with the FASB
The FASB's objective for credit impairment was to develop a single model for all financial instruments that provides more timely credit loss information for users of financial statements.
BC5.111 The feedback received on the Supplementary Document, combined with the importance of achieving convergence, encouraged the IASB and the FASB to jointly develop an alternative expected credit loss model.
The proposed Update would require an entity to measure the net amortised cost at the present value of cash flows that it expects to collect, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
To achieve this, an entity would recognise a loss allowance for expected credit losses from initial recognition at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.
Furthermore, very few respondents demanded convergence at the cost of finalising the requirements in a timely manner.
Many respondents urged the IASB to finalise the proposed model as soon as possible, with or without convergence, stressing the importance of improving the accounting for the impairment of financial assets in IFRS as soon as possible.
BC5.115 The FASB and the IASB reported differences in views from the users of the financial statements.
The IASB identified the following
the starting point of how preparers apply US GAAP for loss allowances is different from the starting point of IFRS preparers.
the interaction between the role of prudential regulators and loss allowances is historically stronger in the US.
many users of financial statements in the US place greater weight on the adequacy of loss allowances in the balance sheet.
The issue of convergence was discussed at length throughout the course of the project.
loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts for the issuer, that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss;
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Thus, the IASB decided that the requirements for the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses shall apply to the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category, in the same way as for assets measured at amortised cost.
However, the loss allowance is recognised in other comprehensive income instead of reducing the carrying amount of the financial asset in the statement of financial position.
Interested parties noted that such a practical expedient would reduce the operational burden of assessing whether increases in credit risk since initial recognition are significant on financial assets that are already measured at fair value.
They also noted that it would not be appropriate to recognise impairment gains or losses in profit or loss on financial assets that were purchased in an active market that prices the initial expectations of credit losses into the financial asset.
BC5.121 The IASB rejected these views. The IASB noted that not all debt instruments acquired in an active market are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
In accordance with paragraph 4.1.2 of IFRS 9, such instruments can also be measured at amortised cost if the business model criteria are met (subject to the cash flow characteristics criteria).
Having separate impairment models for similar financial assets that are measured differently would be inconsistent with the IASB's objective of having a single impairment model.
BC5.122 Furthermore, the IASB observed that a fair value-based practical expedient is inconsistent with the general impairment approach, which is based on an entity's assessment of the changes in the risk of a default occurring since initial recognition.
Introducing a fair value-based practical expedient would represent a different impairment approach and would not result in the amounts recognised in profit or loss being the same as if the financial assets were measured at amortised cost.
BC5.123 The IASB noted that the assessment of credit risk is based on management's view of collecting contractual cash flows instead of on the perspective of a market participant as is the case with fair value measurement.
It was noted that market prices are not in themselves intended to be a determinant of whether credit risk has increased significantly because, for example, market prices can be affected by factors that are not relevant to credit risk (such as changes in the level of general interest rates and the price of liquidity).
However, the IASB noted that market prices are an important source of information that should be considered in assessing whether credit risk has changed.
BC5.124 In the IASB's view, applying a single impairment model to both financial assets at amortised cost and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income will facilitate comparability of amounts that are recognised in profit or loss for assets with similar economic characteristics.
Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts
The Supplementary Document asked respondents whether an entity should apply the same impairment model to loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts as for financial assets measured at amortised cost.
in practice, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts are often managed using the same credit risk management approach and information systems as loans and other on balance sheet items.
a single impairment model for all credit exposures, irrespective of their type, removes the complexity previously caused by different impairment models in IFRS.
BC5.127 However, many of the respondents that supported including loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts within the scope of the impairment requirements proposed that the expected credit losses should be measured over the behavioural life of the product, instead of over the contractual life as was proposed (see paragraphs BC5.254–BC5.261).
Trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables
It also proposed a practical expedient by which they could use a provision matrix as the basis for measurement.
Many respondents told the IASB that applying an expected credit loss model to non-interest-bearing trade receivables would not provide useful information because of their short maturity.
They also noted that there would be operational challenges for non-financial institutions and less sophisticated financial institutions in applying an expected credit loss model.
Consequently, the IASB conducted further outreach to gather information about current practice and the operational challenges of applying an expected credit loss model to trade receivables.
In addition, the cash flows included in lease contracts could include features such as contingent payments that would not be present in other financial instruments.
The existence of contingent and variable lease payments results in
specific requirements for identifying the cash flows that are included in the measurement of the lease receivable (such as the criteria for including contingent lease payments, the treatment of renewal options and the bifurcation of any embedded derivatives); and
a consequential effect on determining the discount rate (ie given (a), the discount rate cannot always be determined in the same way as the effective interest rate for a financial asset measured at amortised cost).
In reaching this decision, the IASB concluded that the impairment model could be applied to lease receivables as long as
the cash flows assessed for expected credit losses are consistent with those included in the measurement of the lease receivable; and
They requested further clarification of the interaction between the expected credit loss requirements and the proposed accounting for lease receivables in accordance with that project.
The IASB acknowledged these concerns and noted that it will further consider this interaction if needed when deliberating the accounting treatment for lease receivables as part of the leases project.
The IASB therefore decided to include contract assets in the scope of the impairment requirements.
Recognition of expected credit losses
In doing so, the IASB considered that this expected credit loss approach will improve financial reporting because
financial statements will clearly distinguish between financial instruments for which credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition and those for which it has not;
a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses will be recognised when credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition, resulting in the timely recognition of expected credit losses; and
Collective and individual assessment of changes in credit risk
BC5.137 In considering the feedback received, the IASB confirmed that the objective of the impairment requirements is to capture lifetime expected credit losses on all financial instruments that have significant increases in credit risk, regardless of whether it is on an individual or a collective basis.
In accordance with IFRS 9, the unit of account is the individual financial instrument.
The timeliness of capturing significant increases in credit risk primarily depends on whether the entity has reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort to identify significant increases in credit risk in a timely manner before financial assets become past due.
However, when credit risk management systems are heavily dependent on past due information, there may be a delay between identifying significant increases in credit risk and when the increase in credit risk has actually occurred.
BC5.139 The IASB observed that any delay is minimised when credit risk management systems capture a comprehensive range of credit risk information that is forward-looking and is updated on a timely basis at the individual instrument level.
The delay is more apparent for portfolios of financial instruments that are managed on the basis of past due information.
BC5.140 The IASB noted that in some circumstances the segmentation of portfolios based on shared credit risk characteristics may assist in determining significant increases in credit risk for groups of financial instruments.
The IASB considered that individual financial assets could be grouped into segments on the basis of common borrower-specific information and the effect of forward-looking information (ie changes in macroeconomic indicators) that affect the risk of a default occurring could be considered for each segment.
The IASB also noted that in other cases an entity may use reasonable and supportable information to determine that the credit risk of a homogeneous portion of a portfolio should be considered to have increased significantly in order to meet the objective of recognising all significant increases in credit risk.
BC5.141 The IASB noted that measuring expected credit losses on a collective basis approximates the result of using comprehensive credit risk information that incorporates forward-looking information at an individual instrument level.
However, financial instruments should not be grouped in order to measure expected credit losses on a collective basis in a way that obscures significant increases in credit risk on individual financial instruments within the group.
As the passage of time reduces the uncertainty about the eventual outcome, the risk of a default occurring on the financial instruments in the portfolio should diverge until the financial instruments either default or are collected in full.
Consequently, the appropriate level of grouping is expected to change over time in order to capture all significant increases in credit risk.
The IASB concluded that an entity should not group financial instruments at a higher level of aggregation if a subgroup exists for which the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses is more appropriate.
Timing of the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses
In other words, an entity would be required to recognise a loss allowance for lifetime expected credit losses, discounted using the original effective interest rate, from initial recognition.
Those respondents believe that because credit losses do not occur rateably throughout the life of a loan, or throughout the life of a portfolio of loans, there is a fundamental disconnect between the 'lumpy' pattern of actual credit losses and a time-based accounting approach that attempts to link the recognition of credit losses that are anticipated at initial recognition of the financial asset with the recognition of interest revenue.
BC5.144 The IASB considered and rejected this view.
At initial recognition, the timing of initial expected credit losses affects the amount of the adjustment to the effective interest rate.
Thus, an earlier expected credit loss would give rise to a larger credit adjustment to the effective interest rate than a later expected credit loss of an equal nominal value.
Because the pattern of initially expected credit losses is priced into the asset as represented by its present value, compensation is received for the amount and timing of those initially expected credit losses.
Thus, in the IASB's view, if initial credit loss expectations do not subsequently change
interest revenue should reflect the credit-adjusted effective return over time; and
there is no credit loss (or gain), because no economic loss (or gain) has occurred.
This means that, while the credit spread that is charged on the lender's overall portfolio of individual loans may be expected to compensate the entity for credit losses for a large portfolio of assets over time, the credit spread on any individual asset is not necessarily established in a way that compensates the lender for expected credit losses on that particular asset.
Thus, the pricing of individual instruments would reflect the probability of credit losses and would be no different to the pricing of an instrument that is part of a portfolio.
Market participants price individual instruments consistently, irrespective of whether they will hold that instrument in isolation or as part of a portfolio.
An estimate of expected credit losses at initial recognition (which an entity could estimate in a number of different ways) would be sufficient for the purposes of determining the credit adjustment to the effective interest rate.
Indeed, any models requiring the recognition of the lifetime expected credit losses at initial recognition would require an entity to make the same estimate.
They believe that it is misleading to investors to allow the balance sheet to reflect a greater amount.
BC5.148 The IASB considered and rejected that view.
The original effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the expected cash flows (before deducting expected credit losses) of the asset to the transaction price (ie the fair value or principal) at initial recognition.
Thus, the original effective interest rate already takes into consideration an entity's initial estimate of expected credit losses (ie it reflects the riskiness of the contractual cash flows).
Requiring the entity to further deduct an amount from the transaction price that represents the same amount that it has already discounted from the contractual cash flows results in the entity double-counting its initial estimate of expected credit losses.
The effect of this would be most apparent at initial recognition, because the carrying amount of the asset would be below the transaction price.
It did this by limiting the measurement of lifetime expected credit losses to financial instruments for which credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition.
it reflects and provides a clear indication that an economic loss occurred as a result of changes in credit risk from initial expectations.
it avoids excessive front-loading of expected credit losses.
measuring lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments that have signs of significant increases in credit risk would be operationally simpler because more data is available for these financial instruments.
Respondents therefore believed that the proposal addresses the concerns of the G20 and others about the delayed recognition of credit losses under an incurred loss approach.
This is because the contractual interest rate has been repriced to reflect the entity's expectations about credit losses and is similar to the economic position on initial recognition of a similar financial instrument with a similar credit risk at origination.
The IASB further noted that the objective of the impairment requirements is to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments if there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition.
BC5.153 The IASB also considered that when a financial instrument is repriced to take into account an increase in credit risk, the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument has increased, implying that the customer is more likely to default than was expected at initial recognition.
The fact that the entity is entitled to a higher yield because of the increase in credit risk does not mean that the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument has not increased.
The IASB therefore decided that, on balance, the assessment of whether lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised should be based solely on the increase in the risk of a default occurring since initial recognition.
Determining significant increases in credit risk
Use of changes in the risk of a default occurring
The IASB noted that the risk of a default occurring is a measurement of the financial instrument's credit risk that does not require the full estimation of expected credit losses.
the tracking of the initial risk of a default occurring (a component of the expected credit losses); and
an assessment of the significance of subsequent changes in the risk of a default occurring to decide whether the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses is required.
These respondents noted that the risk of a default occurring was considered the most relevant factor in assessing credit risk, and that tracking only the risk of a default occurring makes the model more operational, because that generally aligns with their credit risk management practices.
However, some requested clarification about the information that needs to be considered in that assessment.
Respondents were concerned that this would require the explicit calculation and storage of the lifetime probability of default curve for a financial instrument to compare the expected remaining lifetime probability of default at inception with the remaining lifetime probability of default at the reporting date.
BC5.157 The IASB noted that it did not intend to prescribe a specific or mechanistic approach to assess changes in credit risk and that the appropriate approach will vary for different levels of sophistication of entities, the financial instrument and the availability of data.
The IASB confirmed that the use of the term 'probability of a default' occurring was intended to capture the concept of the risk of a default occurring.
This is because credit analysis is a multifactor and holistic analysis, and when making that analysis entities have differences in the availability of data.
Such differences include whether a specific factor is relevant, and its weight compared to other factors which will depend on the type of product, characteristics of the financial instrument and the customer as well as the geographical region.
However, to reduce the risk of misinterpretation, the IASB decided to change the terminology from 'probability of a default occurring' to 'risk of a default occurring'.
Approaches for determining significant increases in credit risk considered and rejected
Absolute level of credit risk
Under this approach, an entity would recognise lifetime expected credit losses on all financial instruments at, or above, a particular credit risk at the reporting date.
An approach based on the absolute credit risk at each reporting date would be much simpler to apply, because it does not require tracking of credit risk at initial recognition.
However, such an approach would provide very different information.
It would not approximate the economic effect of initial credit loss expectations and subsequent changes in expectations.
In addition, if the absolute credit risk threshold for recognising lifetime expected credit losses was too high, too many financial instruments would be below the threshold and expected credit losses would be understated.
If the absolute threshold was too low, too many financial instruments would be above the threshold, overstating the expected credit losses (for example, financial instruments with a high credit risk that an entity prices appropriately to compensate for the higher credit risk would always have lifetime expected credit losses recognised).
Consequently, the IASB rejected this approach.
BC5.161 Although the IASB rejected using an absolute level of credit risk for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses, it noted that the assessment of significant increases in credit risk could be implemented more simply by determining the maximum initial credit risk accepted by the reporting entity for a particular portfolio of financial instruments and then comparing the credit risk of financial instruments in that portfolio at the reporting date to that maximum initial credit risk.
However, the IASB noted that this would only be possible for portfolios of financial instruments with similar credit risk at initial recognition.
Such an approach would enable a change in credit risk to be the basis for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses, but does not require specific tracking of the credit risk on an individual financial instrument since initial recognition.
Change in the credit risk management objective
Because the management of a financial instrument may change only relatively late compared with when significant increases in credit risk occur, the IASB considered this to be a less timely approach to recognising lifetime expected credit losses.
In a similar way to an approach based on the absolute level of credit risk or a change in the credit risk management objective, this approach would not require the change in credit risk since initial recognition to be assessed.
It would thus be inconsistent with the IASB's objective of reflecting increases in credit risk and linking that to pricing.
The objective of setting credit underwriting limits also follows a different objective compared to that of financial reporting, which could result in a misstatement of expected credit losses.
For example, changes in underwriting policies may occur for business reasons, such as wishing to increase lending, resulting in changes to the recognition of expected credit losses on existing financial instruments irrespective of changes in credit risk.
BC5.165 The IASB further noted that the underwriting standards at the time that a financial instrument is initially recognised do not in themselves provide evidence of a significant increase in credit risk.
This is because the new financial instruments cannot, by definition, have experienced significant increases in credit risk at initial recognition.
Furthermore, the underwriting standards of new financial instruments are not relevant to the credit risk of existing financial instruments.
However, the IASB notes that particular vintages may be more prone to increases in credit risk, and thus financial instruments of particular vintages may need to be monitored and assessed with increased vigilance.
BC5.167 The IASB noted that the objective of the impairment requirements is to reflect the economics of lending to provide users of financial statements with relevant information about the performance of financial instruments instead of the performance of a counterparty.
BC5.168 However, the IASB acknowledged that assessing credit risk on a basis that considers a customer's credit risk (ie the risk that a customer will default on its obligations) more holistically may nevertheless be consistent with the impairment requirements.
An overall assessment of a counterparty's credit risk could be undertaken, for example, to make an initial assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly, as long as such an assessment satisfies the requirements for recognising lifetime expected credit losses and the outcome would not be different to the outcome if the financial instruments had been individually assessed.
Extent of increase in credit risk required
However, the IASB decided that, if an entity suffers a significant economic loss, recognition of only a portion of the lifetime expected credit losses is no longer appropriate and it should recognise the full lifetime expected credit losses.
The IASB considered how significant the extent of the increase in credit risk should be, from both an economic and a practical perspective, to justify the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses.
BC5.170 In the IASB's joint deliberations with the FASB, the boards had tentatively agreed that the deterioration criteria for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses should be that the credit quality had deteriorated more than insignificantly subsequent to the initial recognition of the financial instrument.
The IASB observed that entities manage financial instruments and credit risk in different ways, with different levels of sophistication and by using different information.
Selecting a single measure could not properly reflect the assessment of credit across entities, products and geographical regions.
Because of the arbitrariness of defining the extent of increases in credit risk, the IASB questioned the perceived comparability that would result.
In the IASB's view, an entity should consider the term structure and the initial credit risk in assessing whether it should recognise lifetime expected credit losses.
Doing so will improve the comparability of the requirements for financial instruments with different maturities and different initial credit risks.
For example, all other things being equal, a given increase (in absolute terms) in the risk of a default occurring reflects a greater increase in credit risk the shorter the term of the financial instrument and the lower its initial credit risk.
This would also be consistent with the IASB's understanding of existing models for measuring credit risk, such as those underlying external credit ratings, option pricing models and their variants, including the models for measuring the risk of a default occurring for the purposes of prudential regulatory requirements.
BC5.174 If an entity were not required to consider both the initial credit risk and the time until maturity, the assessment would benefit shorter-term financial instruments with low credit risk and would disadvantage longer-term instruments with high credit risk.
In addition, not reflecting the term structure might also result in the assessment that the risk of a default occurring has changed merely because of the passage of time.
This could happen even if an entity had expected such a change at initial recognition.
In the IASB's view, the assessment of the criteria should not change solely because the maturity date is closer.
The IASB reaffirmed its view that an entity should use the best information that is available without undue cost and effort when measuring expected credit losses.
BC5.178 In response to the feedback, the IASB noted that, ideally, an entity should use changes in the lifetime risk of a default occurring to assess changes in credit risk since initial recognition.
Financial instruments that have low credit risk at the reporting date
The IASB proposed this to reduce the operational costs and to make the model more cost-effective.
The IASB observed that for financial instruments with low credit risk, the effect of this simplification on the timing of recognition, and the amount of expected credit losses would be minimal.
This would be the case even if the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses occurred later than it otherwise would have if there had been no simplification.
In the IASB's view, this would help to achieve an appropriate balance between the benefits of distinguishing between financial instruments on the basis of changes in credit risk and the costs of making that distinction.
The IASB also noted that financial instruments of such a quality were not the primary focus for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses.
It was noted that such credit risk is typically equivalent to the investment grade market convention, ie an entity need not assess the extent of the increase in credit risk since initial recognition for financial instruments with credit risk that is equivalent to investment grade.
Most respondents supported a simplification based on low credit risk and noted that it reduces the costs of implementation and avoids recognising lifetime expected credit losses inappropriately.
However, a number of clarifications were suggested regarding the meaning of low credit risk and its application.
Some noted that the low credit risk simplification could paradoxically increase operational complexity because, in addition to assessing the change in credit risk, the absolute credit risk at the reporting date would need to be assessed.
BC5.184 The IASB considered whether to allow reporting entities to have an accounting policy choice on whether to apply the requirement to assess whether a financial instrument is considered to have low credit risk at the reporting date.
It noted that the intention of the low credit risk concept was to provide relief from tracking changes in the credit risk of high quality financial instruments and that requiring an entity to apply it as an accounting policy choice for a class of financial instrument would be inconsistent with this intention.
The assessment of low credit risk can therefore be made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
For example, some were concerned that as soon as a financial instrument was no longer low credit risk, lifetime expected credit losses would be required to be recognised irrespective of the initial credit risk on the financial instrument.
BC5.186 The IASB therefore clarified that
the objective of the low credit risk simplification is to provide operational relief for high quality financial instruments, in other words, those with a low risk of default.
an increase in credit risk that results in a financial instrument no longer being considered to have low credit risk at the reporting date is not an automatic trigger for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses.
Instead, if a financial instrument is not low credit risk at the reporting date, an entity should assess the extent of the increase in credit risk and recognise lifetime expected credit losses only when the increase since initial recognition is significant in accordance with the usual requirements.
BC5.187 Respondents also raised questions about the ambiguity of using 'investment grade' as an example of low credit risk.
Respondents were concerned that only financial instruments that are externally rated by a credit rating agency as investment grade would be considered to have low credit risk.
They also questioned whether the reference to investment grade referred to global or national rating scales.
Instead, the reference to investment grade serves only as an example of a financial instrument that may be considered to have low credit risk.
The credit risk can be determined using alternative measures, such as internal rating grades based on commonly understood notions of credit risk.
BC5.189 Consequently, the IASB confirmed that low credit risk refers to a level of credit risk that is akin to a globally accepted definition of low credit risk.
Respondents noted that the outcome is broadly in line with existing credit risk management practices (ie looking at past due information).
However, some respondents did not support having a past due measure as an indication of when there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
They believe that a past due measure creates a bright line for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses and, because past due status is a lagging indicator of increases in credit risk, it will fail to identify significant increases in credit risk on a timely basis.
However, the IASB acknowledged the feedback that supported the view that many entities manage credit risk on the basis of information about past due status and have a limited ability to assess credit risk on an instrument-by-instrument basis in more detail on a timely basis.
The IASB noted that the application of the rebuttable presumption should identify significant increases in credit risk before financial assets become credit-impaired or an actual default occurs.
The IASB also noted that, ideally, significant increases in credit risk should be identified before financial assets become past due.
However, it noted that to be able to rebut the presumption, an entity would need reasonable and supportable information that indicates that the credit risk has not increased significantly.
The IASB also accepted that significant judgement would be required for any estimation technique that an entity might use.
In the IASB's view, the overall result of such a measurement, combined with the earlier recognition of the full lifetime expected credit losses compared to IAS 39, achieves an appropriate balance between the benefits of a faithful representation of expected credit losses and the operational costs and complexity.
Furthermore, it would allow preparers to make use of existing reporting systems that some regulated financial institutions already apply and would therefore be less costly to implement for those entities.
These alternatives and the IASB's reasons for rejecting them are discussed in paragraphs BC5.200–BC5.209.
In particular, the initial carrying amount of financial assets would be below their fair value.
However, isolating initial credit loss expectations for recognition over the life of financial instruments is operationally complex.
The recognition of a portion of expected credit losses for financial instruments for which there have not been significant increases in credit risk also limits the requirement to perform the more costly and complex calculation of the lifetime expected credit losses.
The IASB considered such a measure of expected credit losses to be superior to the alternatives discussed below.
No allowance for instruments without a significant increase in credit risk
However, only recognising lifetime expected credit losses when there have been significant increases in credit risk, without recognising any expected credit losses before that to reflect the changes in initial expectations of credit risk since initial recognition, would fail to appropriately reflect the economic losses experienced as a result of those (non-significant) changes.
Expected credit losses are implicit in the initial pricing for the instrument, but subsequent changes in those expectations represent economic losses (or gains) in the period in which they occur.
Not reflecting changes in credit risk before the change is considered significant would therefore fail to recognise those economic losses (or gains).
In the view of the IASB, this approach would fail to appropriately reflect the economic effects of over-recognition of interest revenue prior to losses being recognised and would also fail to recognise economic losses experienced as a result of non-significant changes in credit risk or significant increases not yet identified.
However, it rejected requiring a larger portion of expected credit losses to be recognised because
Recognising a greater portion would further increase the overstatement of expected credit losses and, thus, when considered with the much earlier timing of the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses, would be a less faithful representation of the underlying economics.
Recognise expected credit losses for the loss emergence period
BC5.204 This alternative would require entities to consider all reasonable and supportable information available, including historical information, in order to determine the average period of time over which meaningful increases in credit risk are expected to occur.
Consequently, estimating expected credit losses over the relevant period of time it takes for an event to happen and for the effects to be known, may have conceptual merit.
However, the IASB noted that 'emergence' notions fit more naturally in an incurred loss model in which it is difficult to identify when a loss has been incurred on individual instruments.
BC5.206 The IASB also noted that emergence periods may change over the life of financial instruments and depend on the economic cycle.
As a result, the IASB considered that this approach would be more operationally difficult than one that has a defined period, because an entity would have to continually assess that it was using the appropriate emergence period.
Recognise expected credit losses for the foreseeable future
BC5.207 The Supplementary Document proposed that the loss allowance for financial assets in the good book should be calculated as the greater of the time-proportionate amount and expected credit losses for the foreseeable future (see paragraphs BC5.96–BC5.101).
Furthermore, respondents expressed concerns about the calculation of expected credit losses for the foreseeable future, with many expressing confusion about the underlying conceptual basis for such a limitation to the time period.
Many also noted that, despite the conceptual concerns, the term 'foreseeable future' was not sufficiently defined to ensure consistent application.
BC5.209 In response to the concerns raised about the foreseeable future, the IASB rejected the approach.
The IASB did not receive any new information that caused it to change its view.
BC5.210 The IASB's view is that an entity should recognise favourable changes in credit risk consistently with unfavourable changes in credit risk (ie the model should be 'symmetrical'), but only to the extent that those favourable changes represent a reversal of risk that was previously recognised as unfavourable changes.
Doing so would reflect the fact that the expectations of credit losses have moved back towards the initial expectations.
The IASB rejected such a requirement because it reduces the usefulness, neutrality and faithful representation of expected credit losses, and anti-abuse considerations should not override that.
In doing so, they noted that this would be consistent with the objective of a model based on changes in credit risk and would faithfully represent the underlying economics.
Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets
That paragraph required an entity to include the initial expected credit losses in the estimated cash flows when calculating the effective interest rate for financial assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition.
However, in the IASB's view, applying the general approach to purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets would not achieve the desired comparability.
However, this does not mean that all financial assets originated at a high credit risk are within the scope — the financial assets have to be credit-impaired on initial recognition.
In confirming that a financial asset could be credit-impaired on origination the IASB focussed on the potential for the modification of contractual cash flows to result in derecognition.
The IASB considered an example in which a substantial modification of a distressed asset resulted in derecognition of the original financial asset.
Such a case is an example of the rare situation in which a newly originated financial asset may be credit-impaired — it would be possible for the modification to constitute objective evidence that the new asset is credit-impaired at initial recognition.
An entity will recognise changes in the initial expected credit losses as gains or losses.
These respondents considered that it would be operationally simpler to have a gross presentation of expected credit losses for all financial assets, and comparability would be improved if there was an allowance balance for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets like there is for other financial assets.
BC5.220 The IASB noted in response that even if the loss allowance balance was calculated for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets at initial recognition, the carrying amounts would not be comparable.
Purchased or originated credit-impaired assets are initially recognised at fair value and would be grossed-up for the loss allowance balance, resulting in a carrying amount above fair value.
The IASB therefore rejected these arguments.
Simplified approach for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables
an entity would be required to recognise a loss allowance for lifetime expected credit losses on those trade receivables throughout their life.
BC5.223 Respondents indicated that they would not have significant operational difficulty in applying an impairment model based on expected credit losses to their trade receivables without a significant financing component.
While these participants acknowledge that such an impairment model would require a change in practice, they believe that they can incorporate forward-looking information within their current methodologies.
In addition, the outreach participants noted that the IASB had made the application of the impairment model to current trade receivables (ie those that are not past due) more operational without the loss of useful information.
An entity would adjust historical provision rates, which are an average of historical outcomes, to reflect relevant information about current conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts and their implications for expected credit losses, including the time value of money.
Those accounting policy choices would allow entities to decide between fully applying the proposed model or recognising a loss allowance for lifetime expected credit losses from initial recognition until derecognition (the simplified approach).
The IASB noted that allowing this option for trade receivables and lease receivables would reduce comparability.
However, the IASB believed it would alleviate some of the practical concerns of tracking changes in credit risk for entities that do not have sophisticated credit risk management systems.
In addition, the IASB noted that removing the accounting policy choice would require either removing the simplified approach or making it mandatory, neither of which the IASB considered appropriate.
In the IASB's view, the benefits of achieving comparability do not outweigh the costs to implement the full model in this case.
Because the nature of contract assets and the exposure to credit risk is similar to trade receivables, the IASB decided that an entity should have the same accounting policy choice as for trade receivables with a significant financing component and for lease receivables.
Modifications of contractual cash flows
However, modifications frequently do not result in the derecognition of a financial instrument.
The IASB considered how the proposed model will apply to these financial instruments with modified contractual cash flows.
The simplification for financial instruments with low credit risk would also apply to modified financial instruments.
BC5.229 This decision reflected the fact that financial instruments that are modified but not derecognised are not new financial instruments from an accounting perspective and, as a result, the amortised cost measurement would keep the same original effective interest rate.
Consequently, the impairment model should apply as it does for other financial instruments, reflecting the changes in credit risk since initial recognition.
BC5.230 The IASB further noted that when the modification of a financial asset results in the derecognition of the asset and the subsequent recognition of the modified financial asset, the modified asset is considered a 'new' asset from an accounting perspective.
The IASB observed that entities should consider whether a modified financial asset is originated credit-impaired at initial recognition (see paragraphs BC5.214–BC5.220).
Although most respondents supported the proposals, some noted that they would have preferred that the requirements be limited to modifications of credit-impaired assets or modifications undertaken for credit risk management purposes.
These respondents believed that the proposed requirements do not represent the economics of modifications performed for commercial or other reasons that are unrelated to credit risk management.
BC5.232 However, the IASB has previously considered the difficulty of identifying the reason for modifications and renegotiations.
The IASB received feedback from constituents that it is operationally difficult to determine the purpose of modifications (ie whether they are performed for commercial or credit risk management reasons).
BC5.233 The IASB further noted that these requirements were consistent with the previous requirements in paragraph AG8 of IAS 39, which did not differentiate between modifications based on the reason for the modification.
Paragraph AG8 applied to all revisions of estimates of payments or receipts.
This is because amortised cost is a measurement method whereby the carrying amount equates to the present value of the estimated future cash payments or receipts discounted at the effective interest rate.
Furthermore, the difficulty involved in discerning the purpose of modifications, and to what extent a modification is related to credit risk reasons, could create opportunities for manipulation.
This could happen if entities were able to select a 'preferred' treatment for modifications simply because of the purpose of the modification.
Assessment of significant increases in credit risk
BC5.236 The IASB considered whether an entity should assess the increase in credit risk by comparing it to the credit risk at the point of modification.
However, the IASB noted that if the original financial instrument has not been derecognised, the modified financial instrument is not a new financial instrument.
The IASB also noted that by using such an approach the financial instrument would, by definition, not have experienced an increase in credit risk that is more than insignificant since modification.
BC5.237 Thus, the IASB decided that an entity should compare the credit risk at the reporting date with the credit risk as at initial recognition of the unmodified financial instrument in a manner that is consistent with that applied to all other financial instruments.
An entity should base the risk of default occurring after a modification on the ability to meet the modified contractual cash flows.
This should include an assessment of historical and forward-looking information and an assessment of the credit risk over the remaining life of the instrument, which should include the circumstances that led to the modification.
Consequently, the credit risk on a financial asset will not necessarily decrease merely because of a modification.
BC5.238 The IASB observed that it is not unusual for distressed financial instruments to be modified more than once and, therefore, the assessment of whether lifetime expected credit losses should continue to be recognised after modification may be perceived to be based on projections that are optimistic.
In the IASB's view, this faithfully represents the economics of the transaction and it should not override that faithful representation for anti-abuse purposes.
In addition, the IASB observed that entities also modify financial instruments for reasons other than increases in credit risk and, therefore, it would be difficult from an operational standpoint to prescribe asymmetrical guidance only for financial assets that have been modified because of credit risk factors (see paragraphs BC5.227–BC5.235).
Adjustment of gross carrying amount
In accordance with a decoupled approach, an entity would calculate the interest revenue by multiplying the effective interest rate by the gross carrying amount (ie the amount that does not include an adjustment for the loss allowance).
As a result, not adjusting the carrying amount upon a modification would result in inflating interest revenue and the loss allowance.
For example, if credit losses are crystallised by a modification, an entity should recognise a reduction in the gross carrying amount.
There may be situations in which adjusting the gross carrying amount result in the recognition of a gain.
Except for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the new gross carrying amount will represent the future contractual cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Measurement of expected credit losses
The IASB decided to retain the emphasis on the objective of the measurement of expected credit losses, and to keep the requirements principle-based instead of specifying techniques to measure expected credit losses.
Respondents have commented that adopting such a principle-based approach would help reduce complexity and mitigate operational challenges by allowing an entity to use techniques that work best in its specific circumstances.
The recognition of a liability for expected credit losses was limited to loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts with a present contractual obligation to extend credit.
Without a present contractual obligation to extend credit, an entity may withdraw its loan commitment before it extends credit.
Consequently, the IASB concluded that a liability does not exist for loan commitments or financial guarantee contracts when there is no present contractual obligation to extend credit.
To measure the exposure at default of the loan commitments, the issuer needs to estimate the amount that a borrower will have drawn down at the time of default.
Some financial institutions are required to make similar assessments for regulatory capital purposes.
These additional complexities arise because of the uncertainty involved in estimating the behaviour of customers over a longer period.
Interested parties were concerned that the requirements would hold entities to a standard of accuracy that they would not be able to meet.
While it would be less complex to limit the estimate to historical information, it would be inconsistent with the objective of an impairment model based on expected credit losses.
Historical utilisation rates might be a good indicator for future drawdowns, but an entity would also need to consider the need to make adjustments for current and future expectations when estimating expected credit losses.
Generally, they are not forward-looking, and are specific to product types or particular to the entity.
It also would also not address the issue for entities that are not subject to such regulations.
Nevertheless, this estimate is necessary to have a consistent application of the impairment model.
The IASB considered that not having it would defeat the purpose of removing the inconsistency between on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures.
Instead, it proposed allowing entities to use different definitions of default including, when applicable, regulatory definitions of default.
In making this decision, the IASB observed that expected credit losses are not expected to change as a result of differences in the definition of default that was applied, because of the counterbalancing interaction between the way an entity defines default and the credit losses that arise as a result of that definition of default.
Some of those respondents considered the term 'default event' to be ambiguous, and were unclear whether the notion of default should align more closely with indicators about significant increases in credit risk or with the indicators for credit-impaired financial assets.
Those respondents also expressed concern that the absence of prescriptive guidance could result in inconsistent application.
Regulators, in particular, were concerned about the delayed recognition of expected credit losses if default were interpreted solely as non-payment.
These respondents noted that any attempt to be more prescriptive or provide guidance would add confusion and could result in differing default definitions for credit risk management, regulatory and accounting purposes.
The appropriate definition also depends on the nature of the financial instrument in question.
BC5.253 The IASB noted that this rebuttable presumption serves as a 'backstop' to ensure a more consistent population of financial instruments for which significant increases in credit risk is determined when applying the model.
Period over which to estimate expected credit losses
However, the majority of respondents that supported including loan commitments within the scope of the proposed model noted that expected credit losses on some loan commitments should be estimated over the behavioural life of the financial instrument, instead of over the contractual commitment period.
Although they noted that the use of the contractual period would be conceptually appropriate, there was concern that using the contractual period
would be contrary to how the exposures are handled for credit risk management and regulatory purposes;
could result in insufficient allowances for the exposures arising from these contracts; and
would result in outcomes for which no actual loss experience exists on which to base the estimates.
Respondents noted that this applies particularly to revolving credit facilities such as credit cards and overdraft facilities.
For these types of facilities, estimating the expected credit losses over the behavioural life of the instruments was viewed as more faithfully representing their exposure to credit risk.
Such facilities can be viewed as a combination of an undrawn loan commitment and a drawn-down loan asset.
Typically, these facilities can be contractually cancelled by a lender with little or no notice, requiring repayment of any drawn balance and cancellation of any undrawn commitment under the facility.
The IASB noted that, for such facilities, the contractual maturities are often set for protective reasons and are not actively enforced as part of the normal credit risk management processes.
Participants also noted that it may be difficult to withdraw undrawn commitments on these facilities for commercial reasons unless there has been an increase in credit risk.
Consequently, economically, the contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not necessarily prevent an entity from being exposed to credit losses beyond the contractual notice period.
BC5.258 The IASB noted that the expected credit losses on these type of facilities can be significant and that restricting the recognition of a loss allowance to expected credit losses in the contractual notice period would arguably be inconsistent with the notion of expected credit losses (ie it would not reflect actual expectations of loss) and would not reflect the underlying economics or the way in which those facilities are managed for credit risk purposes.
The IASB also noted that the amount of expected credit losses for these facilities could be significantly lower if the exposure is restricted to the contractual period, which may be inconsistent with an economic assessment of that exposure.
These types of financial instruments include both a loan (ie financial asset) and an undrawn commitment (ie loan commitment) component and are managed, and expected credit losses are estimated, on a facility level.
Expected credit losses on the on balance sheet exposure (the financial asset) are not estimated separately from the expected credit losses on the off balance sheet exposure (the loan commitment).
Consequently, the period over which the expected credit losses are estimated should reflect the period over which the entity is expected to be exposed to the credit risk on the instrument as a whole.
The IASB noted that most loan commitments will expire at a specified date, and if an entity decides to renew or extend its commitment to extend credit, it will be a new instrument for which the entity has the opportunity to revise the terms and conditions.
Consequently, the IASB decided to confirm that the maximum period over which expected credit losses for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts are estimated is the contractual period over which the entity is committed to provide credit.
BC5.261 However, to address the concerns raised about the financial instruments noted in paragraphs BC5.254–BC5.257, the IASB decided that for financial instruments that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component and the entity's contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the entity's exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, an entity shall estimate expected credit losses over the period that the entity is expected to be exposed to credit risk and expected credit losses would not be mitigated by credit risk management actions, even if that period extends beyond the maximum contractual period.
When determining the period over which the entity is exposed to credit risk on the financial instrument, the entity should consider factors such as relevant historical information and experience on similar financial instruments.
The measurement of expected credit losses should take into account credit risk management actions that are taken once an exposure has increased in credit risk, such as the reduction or withdrawal of undrawn limits.
Hence, estimates of the amounts and timing of cash flows are based on probability-weighted possible outcomes.
BC5.264 In the IASB's view, an expected value measurement is the most relevant measurement basis because it provides information about the timing, amounts and uncertainty of an entity's future cash flows.
This is because an expected value measurement would
reflect that the pricing of financial instruments includes the consideration of expected credit losses.
Although entities might not attribute specific credit loss estimates to individual financial instruments, and although competitive pressures might influence pricing, entities still consider credit loss expectations for the credit risk of similar obligors when pricing loans on origination and purchase.
not revert (at any time) to an incurred credit loss model — all financial instruments have risk of a default occurring and the measurement will therefore reflect that risk of default and not the most likely outcome.
provide useful information to users of financial statements (ie information about the risk that the investment might not perform).
BC5.265 The IASB observed that an entity can use a variety of techniques to meet the objective of an expected value without requiring detailed statistical models.
The calculation of an expected value need not be a rigorous mathematical exercise whereby an entity identifies every single possible outcome and its probability.
Instead, when there are many possible outcomes, an entity can use a representative sample of the complete distribution for determining the expected value.
Based on the feedback received and fieldwork performed, the IASB believes that many preparers are already performing calculations for internal purposes that would provide an appropriate measure of expected values.
The IASB was concerned that listing acceptable methods might rule out other appropriate methods for measuring expected credit losses, or be interpreted as providing unconditional acceptance of a particular method even when such a measurement would result in an amount that is not consistent with the required attributes of an expected credit loss measurement.
BC5.268 In developing the proposals in the Supplementary Document, the IASB noted that, conceptually, the discount rate for cash flows of an asset cannot be below the risk-free rate.
Therefore, such a proposal would not avoid the operational complexity of determining that credit-adjusted effective interest rate, which would be counter-productive.
Thus, the IASB proposed that an entity should use any rate between the risk-free rate and the effective interest rate, not adjusted for credit risk, as the discount rate.
BC5.269 The IASB observed that some credit risk management systems discount expected cash flows to the date of default.
The proposals would require an entity to discount expected credit losses to the reporting date.
BC5.270 Most respondents to the Supplementary Document supported flexibility in an entity choosing which discount rate it should apply.
These respondents agreed that this flexibility was helpful for easing the operational challenges of determining and maintaining the discount rate.
They also felt that it was appropriate to allow preparers to choose a rate that is suitable for the level of sophistication of their systems and their operational capability.
Those who did not support permitting flexibility in determining the appropriate rate wanted to maintain comparability between entities.
This choice of discount rates did not apply to purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, on which the amortised cost measurement always uses the credit-adjusted effective interest rate.
However, a number of respondents commented on the proposals, the majority of which disagreed with them.
The reasons for their disagreement included that
using the effective interest rate would be consistent with the proposals for originated or purchased credit-impaired financial assets and financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date (ie the rate used to recognise interest revenue should be the same as the rate used to discount expected credit losses);
discounting cash flows using a risk-free rate disregards any compensation that the entity receives to compensate it for credit risk; and
the permitted range of discount rates is too flexible and differences in the amount of the loss allowance due to different discount rates could be material.
that the effective interest rate is the conceptually correct rate and is consistent with amortised cost measurement;
it limits the range of rates that an entity can use when discounting cash shortfalls, thereby limiting the potential for manipulation;
it enhances comparability between entities; and
it avoids the adjustment that arises when financial assets become credit-impaired (interest revenue is required to be calculated on the carrying amount net of expected credit losses) if a rate other than the effective interest rate has been used up to that point.
Respondents have previously noted that they would have to integrate their credit risk management and accounting systems to improve the interaction between them if they have to discount cash shortfalls using the effective interest rate.
BC5.275 Consequently, on the basis of the feedback received and the advantages noted in paragraph BC5.273, the IASB decided to require the use of the effective interest rate (or an approximation of it) when discounting expected credit losses.
This is because the IASB considered that those financial instruments by themselves, before they are drawn down, do not give rise to the notion of interest and that, instead, their cash flow profiles are akin to that of derivatives.
For those loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, revenue recognition of the related fee income does not use the effective interest method.
Consequently, the IASB did not consider it appropriate to simply extend the requirements for the discount rate for measuring expected credit losses that arise from financial assets to the requirements for the discount rate for measuring expected credit losses that arise from loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
current market assessments of the time value of money (ie a rate that does not provide consideration for credit risk such as a risk-free rate); and
the risks that are specific to the cash flows, to the extent that the risks are taken into account by adjusting the discount rate instead of adjusting the cash flows that are being discounted.
BC5.278 Consistent with their feedback in paragraph BC5.272, respondents commented on the disconnect between the discount rate used for the financial asset component (the drawn balance) and the loan commitment component (the undrawn commitment).
They noted that this was an unnecessary complication, because, in accordance with the proposals, the measurement of expected credit losses associated with the loan commitment would change when the facility is drawn, merely as a result of the difference in discount rate.
Furthermore, respondents noted that for credit risk management purposes, a single discount rate is usually applied to these facilities as a whole.
The loan commitment relates directly to the recognised financial asset for which the effective interest rate has already been determined.
The effective interest rate applied to the financial asset therefore already reflects an assessment of the time value of money and the risks that are specific to the cash flows on the loan commitment.
This rate could be considered to represent a reasonable approximation of the discount rate for loan commitments.
BC5.279 Consequently, the IASB agreed that the expected credit losses on loan commitments should be discounted using the same effective interest rate (or an approximation of it) that is used to discount the expected credit losses on the financial asset.
BC5.281 In the IASB's view, historical information is an important foundation on which to measure expected credit losses.
However, an entity should adjust the historical information using reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort to reflect current observable data and forecasts of future conditions if such forecasts are different from past information.
The IASB noted that an entity is not required to incorporate forecasts of future conditions over the entire remaining life of a financial instrument.
In some cases, the best reasonable and supportable information could be the unadjusted historical information, depending on the nature of that information and when it was calculated compared to the reporting date, but it should not be assumed to be appropriate in all circumstances.
The IASB notes that even if an unadjusted historical measure was not appropriate, it could still be used as a starting point from which adjustments are made to estimate expected credit losses on the basis of reasonable and supportable information that incorporates both current and forward-looking information.
However, some of those systems only use credit loss experience based on historical events to set out 'provisioning' levels over the entire economic cycle ('through-the-cycle').
Furthermore, through-the-cycle approaches consider a range of possible economic outcomes instead of those that are actually expected at the reporting date.
This would result in a loss allowance that does not reflect the economic characteristics of the financial instruments at the reporting date.
BC5.283 The IASB notes that financial reporting, including estimates of expected credit losses, are based on information, circumstances and events at the reporting date.
Only information that is available without undue cost or effort and supportable at the reporting date should be considered.
This may include information about current economic conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, as long as the information is supportable and available without undue cost or effort when the estimates are made.
BC5.284 Some interested parties are also of the view that loss allowance balances should be used to provide a counter-cyclical effect by building up loss allowances in good times to be used in bad times.
This would, however, mask the effect of changes in credit loss expectations.
The IASB notes that the objective of the impairment requirements is to faithfully represent the economic reality of expected credit losses in relation to the carrying amount of a financial asset.
The IASB does not include in this objective the recognition of a loss allowance that will sufficiently cover unexpected credit losses, because that is not the primary objective of general purpose financial reporting.
The IASB observed that for information about the effects of the transition to alternative benchmark rates to be useful, the information has to be relevant to users of financial statements and faithfully represent the economic effects of that transition on the entity.
This objective assisted the IASB in assessing whether it should amend IFRS Standards or whether the requirements in IFRS Standards already provided an adequate basis to account for such effects.
Changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of financial assets and financial liabilities arising from the reform
Specifically, entities may change the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument by
amending the contractual terms of a financial asset or a financial liability to replace the referenced interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate;
altering the method for calculating the interest rate benchmark without amending the contractual terms of the financial instrument; and/or
triggering the activation of an existing contractual term such as a fallback clause.
In each situation outlined in paragraph BC5.294 the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument changes as a result of the reform.
What constitutes 'a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability
However, it may be less straightforward if the basis for determining the contractual cash flows changes after the initial recognition of the financial instrument, without an amendment to the contractual terms of that financial instrument—for example, when, to effect the reform, the method for calculating the interest rate benchmark is altered.
Although the contractual terms of the financial instrument may not be amended, such a change in the method for calculating the interest rate benchmark may change the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of that financial instrument compared to the prior basis (ie the basis immediately preceding the change).
The IASB noted that although these paragraphs use different words, both refer to a change in the contractual cash flows or contractual terms after the initial recognition of the financial instrument.
In both cases, such a change was not specified or considered in the contract at initial recognition.
This could cause the economic effects of a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows arising as a result of the reform to be obscured by the form of the change and not reflected in the financial statements, and result in changes with equivalent economic effects being accounted for differently.
BC5.299 Consequently, the IASB highlighted that the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability can change even if the contractual terms of the financial instrument are not amended.
In the IASB's view, accounting consistently for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows arising as a result of the reform, even if the contractual terms of the financial instrument are not amended, would reflect the economic substance of such a change and would therefore provide useful information to users of financial statements.
BC5.300 In addition, as noted in paragraph BC5.294(c), the IASB also learned that some entities may implement the reform through the activation of existing contractual terms, such as fallback provisions.
For example, a fallback provision could specify the hierarchy of rates to which an interest rate benchmark would revert in case the existing benchmark rate ceases to exist.
Doing so, avoids differences in accounting outcomes simply because the changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows were triggered by an existing contractual term instead of by a change in the contractual cash flows or contractual terms after the initial recognition of the financial instrument.
Such diversity in accounting outcomes would reduce the usefulness of information provided to users of financial statements and would be burdensome to preparers.
Changes required by the reform
Different accounting for the modification is specified depending on whether derecognition is required.
If these are the only changes made, the IASB considers that it would be unlikely that the transition to an alternative benchmark rate alone would result in the derecognition of that financial instrument.
Applying that paragraph, a modification gain or loss is determined by recalculating the gross carrying amount of the financial asset as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
Any resulting modification gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss at the date of the modification.
In addition, an entity would be required to use the original effective interest rate (ie the interest rate benchmark preceding the transition to the alternative benchmark rate) to recognise interest revenue or interest expense over the remaining life of the financial instrument.
BC5.306 In the IASB's view, in the context of the reform, such an outcome would not necessarily provide useful information to users of financial statements.
In reaching this view, the IASB considered a situation in which a financial instrument was amended only to replace an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate.
Using the interest rate benchmark-based effective interest rate to calculate interest revenue or interest expense over the remaining life in this situation would not reflect the economic effects of the modified financial instrument.
Maintaining the original effective interest rate could also be difficult, and perhaps impossible, if that rate is no longer available.
In other words, changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability that are required by the reform would not result in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial instrument or immediate recognition of a gain or loss.
The IASB concluded that the application of the practical expedient would provide useful information about the effect of the reform on an entity's financial instruments in the circumstances in which it applies.
BC5.309 The IASB considered the risk that the practical expedient could be applied too broadly, which could result in unintended consequences.
The IASB decided to limit the scope of the practical expedient so that it applies only to changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability that are required by the reform.
That is, to be within the scope of the practical expedient, at the date the basis is changed, the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows would be required to be economically equivalent to the previous basis.
For example, a change would be economically equivalent if it involved only replacing an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate plus a fixed spread that compensated for the basis difference between the interest rate benchmark and the alternative benchmark rate.
For example, these respondents said that some existing interest rate benchmarks prevalent in their jurisdictions are not—at least in the near future—being discontinued.
Nonetheless, entities are expected to transition to alternative benchmark rates because, for example, they anticipate reduced liquidity for the existing benchmark or want to align with global market developments.
For example, some respondents asked whether an entity would need to determine that the discounted present value of the cash flows of the affected financial instrument or its fair value are substantially similar before and after the transition to alternative benchmark rates.
BC5.315 The IASB intended 'economic equivalence' to be principle-based and therefore decided not to include detailed application guidance related to the assessment of that condition.
Acknowledging that different entities in different jurisdictions would implement the reform differently, the IASB did not require a particular approach for assessing this condition.
The IASB noted that because it set no 'bright lines', an entity is required to apply judgement to assess whether circumstances meet the economic equivalence condition.
what alternative benchmark rate will replace the interest rate benchmark and whether a fixed spread adjustment is necessary to compensate for a basis difference between the alternative benchmark rate and the interest rate benchmark preceding replacement.
The entity would assess the overall resulting cash flows, including amounts relating to interest (ie alternative benchmark rate plus any fixed spread adjustment), to determine whether the economic equivalence condition is met.
BC5.316 The IASB noted that for a scenario such as the one described in the example in paragraph BC5.315, that assessment would be sufficient to determine that the economic equivalence condition had been met for those changes.
BC5.317 The IASB acknowledged that changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability are likely to vary significantly across jurisdictions, product types and contracts.
Developing a comprehensive list of changes required by the reform—and, hence, that qualify for the practical expedient—would not be feasible.
The IASB concluded that adding such examples would assist entities in understanding and applying the amendments.
These examples are not exhaustive.
Changes that are not required by the reform
BC5.318 The IASB noted that during negotiations with counterparties to agree on changes to the contractual cash flows required by the reform, entities could simultaneously agree to make changes to the contractual terms that are not necessary as a direct consequence of the reform or are not economically equivalent to the previous terms (eg to reflect a change in the counterparty's credit worthiness).
In the IASB's view, this approach would provide useful information to users of financial statements about the economic effects of any changes to financial instruments not required by the reform while consistently accounting for changes required by the reform.
Other classification and measurement issues
Specifically, following the transition to alternative benchmark rates, whether entities reassess whether an embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host contract.
Specifically, determining whether the practical expedient applies when the interest rate benchmark is not a contractual term of the host contract but instead is imputed at initial recognition.
the recognition of items that would otherwise have not been recognised (for example, a firm commitment);
the measurement of an item on a basis that is different from the measurement basis that is normally required (for example, adjusting the measurement of a hedged item in a fair value hedge); and
the deferral of the changes in the fair value of a hedging instrument for a cash flow hedge in other comprehensive income.
Such changes in fair value would otherwise have been recognised in profit or loss (for example, the hedging of a highly probable forecast transaction).
BC6.77 The IASB noted that, although hedge accounting was an exception from normal accounting requirements, in many situations the information that resulted from applying those normal requirements without using hedge accounting either did not provide useful information or omitted important information.
Hence, the IASB concluded that hedge accounting should be retained.
BC6.78 In the IASB's view, a consistent hedge accounting model requires an objective that describes when and how an entity should
override the general recognition and measurement requirements in IFRS (ie when and how an entity should apply hedge accounting); and
recognise effectiveness and/or ineffectiveness of a hedging relationship (ie when and how gains and losses should be recognised).
provide a link between an entity's risk management and its financial reporting.
Hedge accounting would convey the context of hedging instruments, which would allow insights into their purpose and effect.
mitigate the recognition and measurement anomalies between the accounting for derivatives (or other hedging instruments) and the accounting for hedged items and manage the timing of the recognition of gains or losses on derivative hedging instruments used to mitigate cash flow risk.
BC6.80 However, the IASB rejected both objectives for hedge accounting.
The IASB considered that the proposed objective of hedge accounting reflected a broad articulation of a principle-based approach with a focus on the purpose of the entity's risk management activities.
In addition, the objective also provided for a focus on the statement of financial position and the statement of comprehensive income, thereby reflecting the effects of the individual assets and liabilities associated with the risk management activities on those statements.
This reflected the IASB's intention: that entities should provide useful information about the purpose and effect of hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is applied.
BC6.82 The IASB also noted that, despite that an entity's risk management activities were central to the objective of hedge accounting, an entity would only achieve hedge accounting if it met all the qualifying criteria.
BC6.84 Closed hedged portfolios are hedged portfolios in which items cannot be added, removed or replaced without treating each change as the transition to a new portfolio (or a new layer).
The hedging relationship specifies at inception the hedged items that form that particular hedging relationship.
BC6.85 In practice, risk management often assesses risk exposures on a continuous basis and at a portfolio level.
Consequently, as time passes new exposures are continuously added to such hedged portfolios and other exposures are removed from them.
These are referred to as open portfolios.
Changes could be addressed by treating them like a series of closed portfolios with a short life (ie by periodic discontinuations of the hedging relationships for the previous closed portfolios of items and designations of new hedging relationships for the revised closed portfolios of items).
However, this gives rise to complexities related to tracking, amortisation of hedge adjustments and the reclassification of gains or losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income.
The IASB considered hedge accounting only in the context of groups of items that constitute a gross or net position for which the items that make up that position are included in a specified overall group of items (see paragraphs BC6.427–BC6.467).
Financial institutions also noted that this was important because some of their risk exposures might only qualify for hedge accounting in an open portfolio context (for example, non-interest bearing demand deposits).
BC6.90 The IASB noted that this is a complex topic that warrants thorough research and feedback from interested parties.
Accordingly, the IASB decided to separately deliberate on the accounting for macro hedging as part of its active agenda with the objective of issuing a Discussion Paper.
The IASB also noted that during the project on accounting for macro hedging the status quo of 'macro hedge accounting' under previous Standards would broadly be maintained so that entities would not be worse off in the meantime.
BC6.91 The IASB noted that broadly maintaining the status quo of 'macro hedge accounting' meant that
It also applies to all types of hedges and risks.
This exception does not fit into the new hedge accounting model.
Consequently, it is consistent with that approach to include 'macro cash flow hedge accounting' as an application of the new hedge accounting model.
The IASB also noted that making an exception by carrying forward some parts of the Implementation Guidance but not others could have unintended consequences because it would inevitably create the perception that the IASB had endorsed some parts while it had rejected others.
BC6.94 The IASB also noted that carrying forward Implementation Guidance could not be justified as a means to address any concerns about whether a particular accounting practice complies with the hedge accounting requirements.
However, the IASB emphasised that not carrying forward the Implementation Guidance did not mean that it had rejected that guidance.
Proxy hedging' is a colloquial reference to the use of designations of hedging relationships that do not exactly represent an entity's actual risk management.
Examples include using a designation of a gross amount of an exposure (gross designation) when risks are actually managed on a net position basis, and using designations of variable-rate debt instruments in cash flow hedges when risk management is based on managing the interest rate risk of prepayable fixed-rate debt instruments or deposits (such as core deposits).
Similarly, 'proxy hedging' can involve designating fixed-rate debt instruments in fair value hedges when risk management is based on managing the interest rate risk of variable-rate debt instruments.
The IASB was aware that many financial institutions use 'proxy hedging' as described in paragraph BC6.96.
This requires so called 'proxy hedging' because the designation for hedge accounting purposes is on a gross position basis even though risk management typically manages on a net position basis.
This 'proxy hedging' also includes approaches that for risk management purposes determine the net interest rate risk position on the basis of fixed-rate items.
A cash flow hedge designation can still reflect those approaches in that the net interest rate risk position can be viewed as having a dual character: the hedges bridge, for example, the economic mismatch between fixed-rate assets and variable-rate funding (existing variable-rate funding as well as funding to be obtained in the future to continue to fund the assets as existing funding matures).
Such an economic mismatch can be regarded as fair value interest rate risk when looking at the assets and as cash flow interest rate risk when looking at the funding.
Hence, both fair value and cash flow interest rate risk are inherent aspects of the hedged exposure.
However, hedge accounting requires the designation of the hedging relationship as either a fair value hedge or as a cash flow hedge.
The IASB noted that in that sense, even if a fair value hedge designation better represented a risk management perspective that considers the fixed-rate assets as the primary or leading aspect, a cash flow hedge designation would still reflect the risk management because of the dual character of the risk position.
BC6.99 The IASB noted that in such situations entities have to select some items that give rise to interest rate risk and that qualify for designation as a hedged item and designate them as a gross exposure in order to achieve hedge accounting.
The IASB acknowledged that in those circumstances there is typically no obvious link between any particular designated hedged item and the designated hedging instrument, and that entities select items for designation that are most suitable for hedge accounting purposes.
This means that different entities can have different ways of selecting those items depending on their situation (for example, whether designating an interest rate risk exposure related to a financial asset or a financial liability).
But this did not mean that the entity was prohibited from applying hedge accounting altogether.
Instead, it was only prohibited from using that particular designation of a risk component.
Consequently, the entity could designate the item in its entirety as the hedged item and apply hedge accounting (if it met the qualifying criteria on the basis of that designation).
In contrast, entities' actual risk management often considers the respective line items as hedged at the respective rates that were locked in by the hedges.
The IASB also decided to provide further guidance on how 'proxy hedging' is related to the discontinuation of hedge accounting (see paragraph BC6.331).
Some entities questioned whether it was appropriate to require entities to re-examine and potentially make changes to their hedge accounting while the project on accounting for macro hedging was ongoing.
In the IASB's view it was not necessary from a technical perspective to make any changes in addition to the clarifications that it had already provided (see paragraphs BC6.93–BC6.101).
However, the IASB determined that such a specific scope would be difficult to describe, resulting in added complexity and the risk that interpretation questions would arise.
Hedge accounting for equity investments designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income
Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income for such equity instruments are not reclassified to profit or loss.
Consequently, an entity could not apply hedge accounting if the hedged exposure affected other comprehensive income without reclassification out of other comprehensive income to profit or loss because only such a reclassification would mean that the hedged exposure could ultimately affect profit or loss.
To address these concerns, the IASB considered alternative approaches.
contradict the hedge accounting principle that hedge ineffectiveness should be recognised in profit or loss.
be consistent with the hedge accounting principle that hedge ineffectiveness should be recognised in profit or loss; but
contradict the prohibition of reclassifying from other comprehensive income to profit or loss gains or losses on investments in equity instruments accounted for as at fair value through other comprehensive income.
Introducing another framework would add complexity.
BC6.110 However, the IASB noted that dividends from such investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss.
Consequently, a forecast dividend from such investments could be an eligible hedged item (if all qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are met).
In particular, respondents commented that it was a common risk management strategy for an entity to hedge the foreign exchange risk exposure of equity investments (irrespective of the accounting designation at fair value through profit or loss or other comprehensive income).
In addition, an entity might also hedge the equity price risk even though it does not intend to sell the equity investment because it might still want to protect itself against equity volatility.
Some respondents argued that the inconsistencies that the IASB had discussed in its original deliberations (see paragraphs BC6.107–BC6.108) could be overcome by using a differentiating approach, whereby if fair value changes of the hedging instrument exceeded those of the hedged item hedge ineffectiveness would be presented in profit or loss and otherwise in other comprehensive income.
The IASB considered that that outcome would defeat its aim to reduce complexity in accounting for financial instruments.
The IASB noted that, as a consequence, hedge ineffectiveness would not always be presented in profit or loss but would always follow the presentation of the value changes of the hedged item.
Hence, the IASB decided to include this approach in the final requirements.
However, the IASB was concerned that such a broad scope might result in items qualifying for hedge accounting that might not be suitable hedged items and hence have unintended consequences.
Consequently, the IASB decided against making hedge accounting more generally available to such exposures.
Derivatives embedded in financial assets
In accordance with IAS 39, the separated derivative was eligible for designation as a hedging instrument.
In accordance with IFRS 9, hybrid financial assets are measured in their entirety (ie including any embedded derivative) at either amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss.
No separation of any embedded derivative is permitted.
BC6.118 In the light of the decision that it made on IFRS 9, the IASB considered whether derivatives embedded in financial assets should be eligible for designation as hedging instruments.
an entity could choose to separate embedded derivatives solely for the purpose of designating the derivative component as a hedging instrument; or
an entity could designate a risk component of the hybrid financial asset, equivalent to the embedded derivative, as the hedging instrument.
Consequently, the IASB proposed not to allow derivative features embedded in financial assets to be eligible hedging instruments (even though they can be an integral part of a hybrid financial asset that is measured at fair value through profit or loss and designated as the hedging instrument in its entirety — see paragraph BC6.129).
The reasons for the IASB's decision are summarised in paragraphs BC6.120–BC6.121.
Hence, the IASB considered that reintroducing the separation of embedded derivatives for hybrid financial assets does not target hedge accounting considerations, would consequently not be an appropriate means to address any hedge accounting concerns and in addition would reintroduce complexity for situations that are not common in practice.
However, such an approach would be a significant expansion of the scope of the Hedge Accounting project because the IASB would need to address the question of how to disaggregate a hedging instrument into components.
The IASB did not want to expand the scope of the hedge accounting project beyond financial instruments because the outcome of exploring this alternative would be highly uncertain, could possibly necessitate a review of other Standards and could significantly delay the project.
Consequently, permitting the use of a foreign currency risk component for hedge accounting purposes did not require separate, additional requirements for risk components within the hedge accounting model.
This is because the effects of components of the cash instrument that are not related to the risk being hedged cannot be excluded from the hedging relationship and consequently from the effectiveness assessment.
Consequently, depending on the size of the components that are not related to the risk being hedged, in most scenarios it will be difficult to demonstrate that there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument that gives rise to an expectation that their values will systematically change in response to movements in either the same underlying or underlyings that are economically related in such a way that they respond in a similar way to the risk that is being hedged.
The IASB noted that permitting this would require developing an approach for disaggregating non-derivative hedging instruments into components.
For reasons similar to those set out in paragraph BC6.121 the IASB decided not to explore such an approach.
The IASB considered whether for hedges of all types of risk (ie not limited to hedges of foreign currency risk) it should extend the eligibility as hedging instruments to non-derivative financial instruments
BC6.128 The IASB noted that extending the eligibility to non-derivative financial instruments in categories other than fair value through profit or loss would give rise to operational problems because to apply hedge accounting would require changing the measurement of non-derivative financial instruments measured at amortised cost when they are designated as hedging instruments.
The IASB considered that the only way to mitigate this issue was to allow for the designation of components of the non-derivative financial instrument.
This would limit the change in measurement to a component of the instrument attributable to the hedged risk.
However, the IASB had already rejected that idea in its deliberations (see paragraph BC6.126).
BC6.129 However, the IASB noted that extending the eligibility to non-derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value through profit or loss, if designated in their entirety (instead of only some risk components of them), would not give rise to the need to change the measurement or the recognition of gains and losses of the financial instrument.
The feedback highlighted that this was particularly relevant in countries that have legal and regulatory restrictions on the use and availability of derivative financial instruments.
BC6.131 Some respondents argued that there was no conceptual basis to restrict the eligibility of non-derivative financial instruments to those that are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
In their view all non-derivative financial instruments should be eligible as hedging instruments.
BC6.132 Other respondents thought that that the proposals were not restrictive enough, particularly in relation to non-derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value through profit or loss as a result of applying the fair value option.
Those respondents thought that the IASB should specifically restrict the use of non-derivative financial instruments designated under the fair value option because these have usually been elected to be measured at fair value to eliminate an accounting mismatch and hence should not qualify for hedge accounting.
For example, the IASB noted that it would have to determine how to account for the difference between the fair value and the amortised cost of the non-derivative financial instrument upon designation as a hedging instrument.
Furthermore, upon discontinuation of the hedging relationship, the measurement of the non-derivative financial instrument would revert to amortised cost resulting in a difference between its carrying amount as of the date of discontinuation (the fair value as at the discontinuation date which becomes the new deemed cost) and its maturity amount.
The IASB considered that addressing those aspects would inappropriately increase complexity.
BC6.135 Consequently, the IASB decided that non-derivative financial instruments should be eligible hedging instruments only if they are already accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
BC6.136 The IASB also discussed whether or not those non-derivative financial instruments that are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss as a result of applying the fair value option should be eligible for designation as a hedging instrument.
For example, if a non-derivative financial instrument that has previously been designated under the fair value option is included in a cash flow hedge relationship, the accounting for the non-derivative financial instrument under the fair value option would have to be overridden.
This is because all (or part) of the changes in the fair value of that hedging instrument are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The IASB noted that similar considerations apply to fair value hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
BC6.137 Consequently, the IASB considered whether it should introduce a general prohibition against designating, as hedging instruments, non-derivative financial instruments that are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss as a result of electing the fair value option.
However, such a prohibition would not necessarily be appropriate.
However, because the fair value option is irrevocable it would mean a non-derivative financial instrument for which the fair value option was initially elected could never qualify as a hedging instrument even if there was no longer a conflict between the purpose of the fair value option and the purpose of hedge accounting.
A general prohibition would not allow the use of hedge accounting at a later stage even when hedge accounting might then mitigate an accounting mismatch (without recreating another one).
BC6.138 The IASB noted that when a non-derivative financial instrument is accounted for at fair value through profit or loss as a result of electing the fair value option, the appropriateness of its use as a hedging instrument depends on the relevant facts and circumstances underlying the fair value option designation.
The IASB considered that if an entity designates as a hedging instrument a financial instrument for which it originally elected the fair value option, and this results in the mitigation of an accounting mismatch (without recreating another one), using hedge accounting was appropriate.
However, the IASB emphasised that if applying hedge accounting recreates, in the financial statements, the accounting mismatches that electing the fair value option sought to eliminate, then designating the financial instrument for which the fair value option was elected as a hedging instrument would contradict the basis (qualifying criterion) on which the fair value option was elected.
Hence, in those situations there would be a conflict between the purpose of the fair value option and the purpose of hedge accounting as they could not be achieved at the same time but instead would, overall, result in another accounting mismatch.
Consequently, the IASB emphasised that designating the non-derivative financial instrument as a hedging instrument in those situations would call into question the legitimacy of electing the fair value option and would be inappropriate.
The IASB considered that, to this effect, the requirements of the fair value option were sufficient and hence no additional guidance was necessary.
BC6.140 The IASB also considered whether it needed to provide more guidance on when a non-derivative financial liability designated as at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option would qualify as a hedging instrument.
However, for the eligibility as a hedging instrument, the IASB considered that it would make a difference whether the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income or profit or loss.
only the part of the liability that is measured at fair value through profit or loss, in which case the hedging relationship would exclude credit risk and hence any related hedge ineffectiveness would not be recognised; or
Internal derivatives as hedging instruments
Some use a centralised treasury or similar function that is responsible for identifying the exposures and managing the risks borne by various entities within the group.
Others use a decentralised risk management approach and manage risks individually for entities in the group.
Consequently, in order to explore how to align accounting with risk management, the IASB considered whether internal derivatives should be eligible for designation as hedging instruments.
However, the IASB noted that the ineligibility of internal derivatives as hedging instruments was not the root cause of misalignment between risk management and hedge accounting.
Instead, the challenge was how to make hedge accounting operational for groups of items and net positions.
BC6.144 The IASB noted that, for financial reporting purposes, the mitigation or transformation of risk is generally only relevant if it results in a transfer of risk to a party outside the reporting entity.
The central treasury might decide to retain that exposure (instead of hedging it out to a party external to the group).
In that case, the cash flow interest rate risk of the stand-alone subsidiary has been transferred (the swap is an external derivative from the subsidiary's perspective).
However, from the group's consolidated perspective, the cash flow interest rate risk has not changed but merely been reallocated between different parts of the group (the swap is an internal derivative from the group's perspective).
Intragroup monetary items as hedging instruments
BC6.153 The IASB considered that the eligibility of an option contract to be designated as a hedging instrument should depend on its economic substance instead of its legal form.
That practice considers the following cumulative factors to ascertain that an interest rate collar or other derivative instrument that includes a written option is not a net written option
no net premium is received either at inception or over the life of the combination of options.
The distinguishing feature of a written option is the receipt of a premium to compensate the writer for the risk incurred.
except for the strike prices, the critical terms and conditions of the written option component and the purchased option component are the same (including underlying variable or variables, currency denomination and maturity date).
Also, the notional amount of the written option component is not greater than the notional amount of the purchased option component.
Financial instruments held within a business model whose objective is to collect or pay contractual cash flows
The IASB focused on fair value hedges of interest rate risk because other risks (for example, foreign currency risk) affect cash flows that are collected or paid and the application of hedge accounting seemed clearly appropriate.
Consequently, some argue that, on the basis of the assertion underlying the business model assessment, the entity should be interested only in the contractual cash flows arising from those investments and not in the changes in fair value.
That entity could create the cash flow profile of a variable-rate asset indirectly by buying both the available fixed-rate investment and entering into an interest rate swap that transforms the fixed-interest cash flows from that asset into variable-interest cash flows.
The IASB noted that this and other examples demonstrated that what is a fair value hedge for accounting purposes is, from a risk management perspective, often a choice between receiving (or paying) fixed versus variable interest cash flows, instead of a strategy to protect against fair value changes.
Hence, the IASB considered that a fair value hedge of interest rate risk would not in itself contradict the assertion that a financial instrument is held with the objective to collect or pay contractual cash flows.
Consequently, the IASB decided that fair value hedge accounting should be available for financial instruments that are held with the objective to collect or pay contractual cash flows.
In practice, this has generally prevented derivatives from qualifying as hedged items.
Similarly, positions that are a combination of an exposure and a derivative ('aggregated exposures') failed to qualify as hedged items.
It stated that derivative instruments were always deemed to be held for trading and measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
If a stand-alone purchased option can be a hedged item then prohibiting derivatives that are part of an aggregated exposure to be part of a hedged item is arbitrary.
BC6.163 The main requests that respondents made to the IASB were
to provide examples that would illustrate the accounting mechanics for aggregated exposures;
to clarify that accounting for aggregated exposures is not tantamount to 'synthetic accounting'; and
The IASB considered that numerical examples illustrating the mechanics of the accounting for aggregated exposures would, at the same time, address other questions raised in the feedback on the proposals, such as how hedge ineffectiveness is recognised and the type of the hedging relationships involved.
This would have had the consequence that a derivative could have assumed the accounting treatment for a non-derivative item (for example, accounting at amortised cost).
Hence, the IASB emphasised that accounting for aggregated exposures does not allow 'synthetic accounting'.
Hence, the IASB decided to provide, in addition to illustrative examples, an explicit statement confirming that derivatives that form part of an aggregated exposure are always recognised as separate assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.
that the notion of an aggregated exposure includes a highly probable forecast transaction of an aggregated exposure if that aggregated exposure, once it has occurred, is eligible as a hedged item; and
how to apply the general requirements of designating a derivative as the hedging instrument in the context of aggregated exposures.
If the derivative is not designated as the hedging instrument at the level of the aggregated exposure, it must be designated in its entirety or as a proportion of it.
The IASB noted that, consistent with the general requirements of the hedge accounting model, this also ensures that including a derivative in an aggregated exposure does not allow splitting a derivative by risk, by parts of its term or by cash flows.
Designation of a risk component
for financial items, an entity could designate a risk component if that risk component was separately identifiable and reliably measurable; however
for non-financial items, an entity could only designate foreign currency risk as a risk component.
Consequently, other than for foreign currency risk, a non-financial item was required to be designated as the hedged item for all risks.
This has resulted in the hedge accounting requirements being misaligned with many risk management strategies.
The outcome was that the normal approach for risk management purposes was treated as the exception by the hedge accounting requirements.
This was also the most common issue raised during the IASB's outreach activities.
As part of its deliberations, the IASB considered whether risk components should be eligible for designation as hedged items when they are
BC6.174 Contractually specified risk components determine a currency amount for a pricing element of a contract independently of the other pricing elements and, therefore, independently of the non-financial item as a whole.
Consequently, these components are separately identifiable.
The IASB also noted that many pricing formulas that use a reference to, for example, benchmark commodity prices are designed in that way to ensure that there is no gap or misalignment for that risk component compared with the benchmark price.
Consequently, by reference to that risk component, the exposure can be economically fully hedged using a derivative with the benchmark as the underlying.
This means that the hedge effectiveness assessment on a risk components basis accurately reflects the underlying economics of the transaction (ie that there is no or very little ineffectiveness).
Nonetheless, many hedging strategies involve the hedging of components even if they are not contractually specified.
There are different reasons for using a component approach to hedging, including
the entire item cannot be hedged because there is a lack of appropriate hedging instruments;
it is cheaper to hedge the single components individually than the entire item (for example, because an active market exists for the risk components, but not for the entire item); and
the entity makes a conscious decision to hedge only particular parts of the fair value or cash flow risk (for example, because one of the risk components is particularly volatile and it therefore justifies the costs of hedging it).
BC6.176 The IASB learned from its outreach activities that there are circumstances in which entities are able to identify and measure many risk components (not only foreign currency risk) of non-financial items with sufficient reliability.
Appropriate risk components (if they are not contractually specified) can be determined only in the context of the particular market structure related to that risk.
Consequently, the determination of appropriate risk components requires an evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances (ie careful analysis and knowledge of the relevant markets).
The IASB noted that as a result there is no 'bright line' to determine eligible risk components of non-financial items.
Those respondents noted that the proposal on risk components was a key aspect of the new hedge accounting model because it would allow hedge accounting to reflect that, in commercial reality, hedging risk components was the norm and hedging items in their entirety was the exception.
They considered the distinction between financial and non-financial items for determining which risk components would be eligible hedged items as arbitrary and without conceptual justification.
The main request by respondents was for additional guidance or clarifications.
BC6.180 Only a few respondents disagreed with the IASB's proposal on risk components. Those respondents believed that, in situations in which non-contractually specified risk components of non-financial items would be designated as hedged items, no hedge ineffectiveness would be recognised.
BC6.181 The IASB noted that the debate about risk components suffered from some common misunderstandings.
In the IASB's opinion, the root cause of those misunderstandings is the large number of markets and circumstances in which hedging takes place. This results in an inevitable lack of familiarity with many markets.
the effect of risk components; and
hedge ineffectiveness when designating a risk component.
BC6.182 The IASB noted that some believe that designating a risk component as a hedged item should not be allowed if it could result in the value of that risk component moving in an opposite direction to the value of the entire item (ie its overall price).
For example, if the hedged risk component increases in value this would offset the loss on the hedging instrument, while decreases in the value of other unhedged risk components remain unrecognised.
BC6.183 The IASB noted that this was not specific to non-contractually specified risk components of non-financial items, but that it applied to risk components in general.
For example, consider an entity that holds a fixed-rate bond and the benchmark interest rate decreases but the bond's spread over the benchmark increases.
If the entity hedges only the benchmark interest rate using a benchmark interest rate swap, the loss on the swap is offset by a fair value hedge adjustment for the benchmark interest rate component of the bond (even though the bond's fair value is lower than its carrying amount after the fair value hedge adjustment because of the increase in the spread).
BC6.184 The IASB also noted that designating a risk component was not tantamount to 'hiding losses' or avoiding their recognition by applying hedge accounting. Instead, it would help to mitigate accounting mismatches that would otherwise result from how an entity manages its risks.
If designation on a risk component basis is not available, that initially creates an issue of whether the hedge qualifies at all for hedge accounting and is inconsistent with the economic decision of hedging done on a components basis.
Consequently, the accounting assessment would be completely disconnected from the decision making of an entity, which is driven by risk management purposes.
The IASB also noted that this consequence would be amplified by the fact that the hedged component is not necessarily the main or largest component (for example, in the case of a power purchase agreement with a contractual pricing formula that includes indexations to fuel oil and inflation, only the inflation risk but not the fuel oil price risk is hedged).
However, because hedge accounting would be disconnected from what is economically hedged, there would also be ramifications for the hedge ratio that would have to be used for designating the hedging relationship.
This is the sensible basis for hedging decisions.
However, for accounting purposes, an entity would be forced to compare changes in the value of the hedging instrument to those of the entire item.
This means that, in order to improve the offset for the hedging relationship that is designated for accounting purposes, an entity would have to create a deliberate mismatch compared to the economic hedging relationship, which is tantamount to distorting the economic hedge ratio for accounting purposes.
The IASB noted that distorting the hedge ratio also meant that prohibiting the designation of hedged items on a risk components basis would, ultimately, not necessarily result in the financial statements reflecting the change in the value of the unhedged risk component as a gain or loss for which there is no offset.
Hence, prohibiting that kind of designation would not achieve transparency about the changes in the value of unhedged components by showing a gain or loss for which there is no offset.
BC6.186 The IASB also noted that designating risk components as hedged items would reflect the fact that risk management typically operates on a 'by risk' basis instead of on a 'by item' basis (which is the unit of account for financial reporting purposes).
Hence, the use of risk components as hedged items would reflect what in commercial reality is the norm instead of requiring that all hedged items are 'deemed' to be hedged in their entirety (ie for all risks).
A few respondents believed that if a risk component was designated as the hedged item, it would result in no hedge ineffectiveness being recognised.
BC6.188 The IASB noted that the effect of designating a risk component as the hedged item was that it became the point of reference for determining offset (ie the fair value change on the hedging instrument would be compared to the change in value of the designated risk component instead of the entire item).
This would make the comparison more focused because it would exclude the effect of changes in the value of risks that are not hedged, which would also make hedge ineffectiveness a better indicator of the success of the hedge.
The IASB noted that the hedge accounting requirements would apply to the risk component in the same way as they apply to other hedged items that are not risk components.
Consequently, even when a risk component was designated as the hedged item, hedge ineffectiveness could still arise and would have to be measured and recognised.
Even though the hedged item is designated as the benchmark interest rate related variability in cash flows (ie as a risk component), the difference in reset dates causes hedge ineffectiveness.
There is no market structure that would support identifying a 'reset date' risk component in the variable payments on the floating rate debt that would mirror the reset dates of the interest rate swap.
In particular, the terms and conditions of the interest rate swap cannot be simply imputed by projecting terms and conditions of the interest rate swap onto floating-rate debt.
In particular, the terms and conditions of the interest rate swap cannot be simply imputed by projecting terms and conditions of the interest rate swap onto the fixed-rate debt.
Because of the natural decline of the benchmark oil field the derivatives market for that benchmark has suffered a significant decline in liquidity.
In response, the entity decides to use derivatives for a different benchmark for light sweet crude oil in a different geographical area because the derivatives market is much more liquid.
The changes in the crude oil price for the more liquid benchmark and the less liquid benchmark are closely correlated but vary slightly.
There is no market structure that would support identifying the more liquid benchmark as a component in the variable payments under the oil supply contract.
In particular, the terms and conditions of the derivatives indexed to the more liquid benchmark cannot simply be imputed by projecting terms and conditions of those derivatives onto the oil supply contract.
The entity's jet fuel purchases are in North America and Europe.
The entity determines that the relevant crude oil benchmark for jet fuel purchases at its North American locations is West Texas Intermediate (WTI) whereas it is Brent for jet fuel purchases at its European locations.
Hence, the entity designates as the hedged item a WTI crude oil component for its jet fuel purchases in North America and a Brent crude oil component for its jet fuel purchases in Europe.
Historically, WTI and Brent have been closely correlated and the entity's purchase volume in North America significantly exceeds its European purchase volume.
Changes in the price differential between WTI and Brent cause hedge ineffectiveness related to the forecast purchases of jet fuel in Europe.
There is no market structure that would support identifying WTI as a component of Brent.
In particular, the terms and conditions of the WTI futures cannot simply be imputed by projecting terms and conditions of those derivatives onto the forecast jet fuel purchases in Europe.
However, the IASB considered that this was not a financial versus non-financial item problem.
Determining the hedge ineffectiveness, for example, for a fixed-rate debt instrument when designating the benchmark interest rate component as the hedged item is no more or less troublesome than doing so for commodity price risk.
In both cases the appropriate designation of a risk component depends on an appropriate analysis of the market structure.
The IASB noted that the derivative markets for commodity risk had evolved and had resulted in customs that helped improve the effectiveness of hedging.
For example, very liquid commodity benchmarks have evolved, allowing for a market volume for derivatives that is far larger than the physical volume of the underlying commodity, thus facilitating benchmarks that can be widely used.
Because of the large variety of markets and circumstances in which hedging takes place, the IASB considered that, in order to avoid arbitrary discrimination against some markets, risks or geographies, there was no alternative to using a criteria-based approach to identifying eligible risk components.
Consequently, the IASB decided that for risk components (of both financial and non-financial items) to qualify as eligible hedged items, they must be separately identifiable and reliably measureable.
In response to requests from respondents, the IASB also decided to expand the examples of how to determine eligible risk components, including illustrations of the role of the market structure.
The IASB noted that an outright ban meant that the general criteria for the eligibility of risk components could not be applied and, as a result, would leave no room for the possibility that in some situations there might be circumstances that could support identifying a risk component for inflation risk.
On the other hand, the IASB was concerned that the removal of the restriction would encourage the use of inflation risk components for hedge accounting when it was not necessarily appropriate to do so.
This would be the case when a risk component, instead of being supported by the market structure and independently determined for the hedged item, would, for example, be determined by simply projecting the terms and conditions of the inflation derivative that was actually used as the hedge onto the hedged item.
In the light of this trade-off, the IASB also considered that financial markets continuously evolve and that the requirements should be capable of addressing changes in the market over time.
However, it was concerned that its decision could be misunderstood as simply 'rubber stamping' the use of inflation risk components for hedge accounting without proper application of the criteria for designating risk components.
The IASB therefore agreed to include a caution in the final requirements that, in order to determine whether inflation risk is an eligible risk component, a careful analysis of the facts and circumstances is required so that the criteria for designating risk components are properly applied.
Consequently, the IASB decided to add a rebuttable presumption related to non-contractually specified inflation risk components of financial instruments.
Designation of 'one-sided' risk components
However, the IASB decided to change the accounting for the time value of options (see paragraphs BC6.386–BC6.413).
Components of a nominal amount — designation of a component that is a proportion
BC6.197 The IASB noted that components that form some quantifiable nominal part of the total cash flows of the instrument are typically separately identifiable.
BC6.198 The IASB noted that a proportion of an item forms the basis of many different risk management strategies and are commonly hedged in practice (often in combination with risk components).
The IASB concluded that if the effectiveness of the hedging relationship can be measured, an entity should be permitted to designate a proportion of an item as a hedged item (as previously permitted by IAS 39).
Components of a nominal amount — designation of a layer component
Such a designation accommodates the fact that there is some uncertainty surrounding the hedged item related to the amount or timing.
This uncertainty does not affect the hedging relationship to the extent that the hedged volume occurs (irrespective of which particular individual items make up that volume).
BC6.201 The IASB considered whether similar considerations should also apply to a hedge of an existing transaction or item in some situations.
For example, a firm commitment or a loan might also involve some uncertainty because
a contract with an early termination option (for repayment at fair value) might be terminated before maturity.
BC6.202 Because there is uncertainty for both anticipated transactions and existing transactions and items, the IASB decided not to distinguish between such transactions and items for the purposes of designating a layer component.
If the designation of those components is not aligned with the risk management strategy of the entity, it might result in profit or loss providing confusing or less useful information to users of financial statements.
The IASB also proposed that a layer component of a contract that includes a prepayment option should not be eligible as a hedged item in a fair value hedge if the option's fair value is affected by changes in the hedged risk.
The IASB noted that if the prepayment option's fair value changed in response to the hedged risk a layer approach would be tantamount to identifying a risk component that was not separately identifiable (because the change in the value of the prepayment option owing to the hedged risk would not be part of how the hedge effectiveness would be measured).
They agreed that such layers would allow entities to better reflect what risk they actually hedge.
Those respondents' main objection was that the proposal was inconsistent with common risk management strategies and that the fair value changes of a prepayment option were irrelevant in the context of a bottom layer.
BC6.207 In the light of the comments received, the IASB discussed
whether the prohibition to designate a layer component as the hedged item in a fair value hedge should relate to an entire item or contract containing a prepayment option or whether it should relate only to those situations in which the designated layer contains a prepayment option;
whether a layer component can be designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge if it includes the effect of a related prepayment option; and
whether the requirement should differentiate between written and purchased prepayment options, thereby allowing a layer component to be designated for items with a purchased option, ie if the entity is the option holder (for example, a debtor's call option included in prepayable debt).
The IASB considered that this would be consistent with its rationale for proposing to prohibit a layer component of an (entire) item or contract that contains a prepayment option (see paragraph BC6.204) to be designated.
to allow a layer-based designation for those amounts that are not prepayable at the time of designation of a partially prepayable item.
BC6.210 The IASB also discussed whether a layer component should be available for designation as the hedged item in a fair value hedge if it includes the effect of a related prepayment option when determining the change in fair value of the hedged item.
BC6.211 Including the change in fair value of the prepayment option that affects a layer when determining hedge ineffectiveness has the following consequences
the designated hedged item would include the entire effect of changes in the hedged risk on the fair value of the layer, ie including those resulting from the prepayment option; and
if the layer was hedged with a hedging instrument (or a combination of instruments that are designated jointly) that does not have option features that mirror the layer's prepayment option, hedge ineffectiveness would arise.
BC6.212 The IASB noted that a designation of a layer as the hedged item, if it included the effects of a related prepayment option when determining the change in fair value of the hedged item, would not conflict with its rationale for proposing the requirements related to the implication of prepayment options for layer designations (see paragraph BC6.204).
Some respondents had argued that if the entity was the option holder, it would control the exercise of the option and could therefore demonstrate that the option was not affected by the hedged risk.
BC6.215 However, the IASB noted that the hedged risk affects the fair value of a prepayment option irrespective of whether the particular option holder actually exercises it at that time or intends to actually exercise it in the future.
The fair value of the option captures the possible outcomes and hence the risk that an amount that would be in the money might be repaid at a different amount than at fair value before taking the prepayment option into account (for example, at par).
Consequently, the IASB noted that whether a prepayment option is a purchased or a written option does not affect the change in the option's absolute fair value but instead determines whether it is either a gain or a loss from the entity's perspective.
In other words, the IASB considered that the aspect of who controls the exercise of the option relates to whether any intrinsic value would be realised (but not whether it exists).
Relationship between components and the total cash flows of an item
When an entity has an interest-bearing debt instrument with an interest rate that is below LIBOR (or linked to a reference rate that is demonstrably below LIBOR), it would not be able to designate a hedging relationship based on a LIBOR risk component that assumes LIBOR cash flows that would exceed the actual cash flows on that debt instrument.
However, for an asset or liability with a negative spread to LIBOR, an entity could still achieve hedge accounting by designating all of the cash flows of the hedged item for LIBOR interest rate risk (which is different from designating a LIBOR component that assumes cash flows exceeding those of the hedged item).
BC6.218 When an entity (particularly a bank) has access to sub-LIBOR funding (bearing a variable-interest coupon at LIBOR minus a spread or an equivalent fixed-rate coupon), the negative spread represents a positive margin for the borrower.
This is because banks on average pay LIBOR for their funding in the interbank market.
Another example of when this occurs is when the reference rate is highly correlated with LIBOR and the negative spreads arise because of the better credit risk of the contributors to the reference index compared with LIBOR.
When entering into hedging relationships, an entity cannot obtain (at a reasonable cost) a standardised hedging instrument for all transactions that are priced sub-LIBOR.
Consequently, such an entity uses hedging instruments that have LIBOR as their underlying.
That feedback showed that some participants believed that designating a risk component that assumes cash flows that would exceed the actual cash flows of the financial instrument reflected risk management in situations in which the hedged item has a negative spread to the benchmark rate.
They believed that it should be possible to hedge the LIBOR risk as a benchmark component and treat the spread as a negative residual component.
They argued that they were hedging their exposure to the variability of cash flows attributable to LIBOR (or a correlated index) using LIBOR swaps.
By doing this, such an entity ensures that exposure to benchmark interest rate risk is managed and that the profit margin of the hedged items (ie the spread relative to the benchmark) is protected against LIBOR changes, provided that LIBOR is not below the absolute value of the negative spread.
However, if LIBOR falls below the absolute value of that negative spread it would result in 'negative' interest, or interest that is inconsistent with the movement of market interest rates (similar to a 'reverse floater').
The IASB noted that these outcomes are inconsistent with the economic phenomenon to which they relate.
However, the IASB emphasised that hedge accounting would still be available on the basis of designating all the cash flows of an item for a particular risk, ie a risk component for the actual cash flows of the item (see paragraph BC6.217).
BC6.222 The IASB received mixed views on its proposal to retain this restriction.
Their view reflects the fact that they are hedging their exposure to the variability of cash flows attributable to LIBOR (or a correlated index) using LIBOR swaps (see paragraph BC6.226 for an example).
In their view, the IASB's proposal would not allow them to properly reflect the hedging relationship, and would force them to recognise hedge ineffectiveness that, in their view, would not reflect their risk management strategy.
BC6.223 In response to the concerns raised, the IASB considered whether it should allow the designation of risk components on a benchmark risk basis that assumes cash flows exceeding the total actual cash flows of the hedged item.
The entity enters into a LIBOR-based interest rate swap with the aim of locking in the margin that it will earn on the combined position.
If the entity wants to designate the hedged item on the basis of the interest rate risk that results from its financial asset, this would be an example of a cash flow hedge of variable-rate interest cash flows from a sub-LIBOR asset.
This means that if designated on a full LIBOR risk component basis, the hedging relationship would have outcomes that would be inconsistent with the notion of a locked margin.
In this example, the margin could become variable instead of being locked.
The IASB was of the view that, in the context of hedge accounting, this would give rise to hedge ineffectiveness that must be recognised in profit or loss.
The IASB noted that this hedge ineffectiveness resulted from the absence of offsetting cash flows and hence represented a genuine economic mismatch between changes in cash flows on the floating-rate asset and the swap.
Hence, if a full LIBOR component was imputed for interest bearing instruments that are priced sub-LIBOR, it would inappropriately defer hedge ineffectiveness in other comprehensive income.
In the IASB's view this would be tantamount to accrual accounting for the interest rate swap.
Consequently, the variability in cash flows of the hedging instrument that locks the margin would be offset by the variability of the cash flows of the sub-LIBOR instrument irrespective of the LIBOR level.
In other words, the LIBOR-related cash flow variability when the asset had no floor would be equivalent to that of a full LIBOR component and therefore the proposed requirement would not prohibit designating the hedged item accordingly (ie as changes in cash flows of a full LIBOR risk component).
But, given that under the new hedge accounting model this issue also applies to non-financial items that are traded below their respective benchmark price, the IASB decided to add an example of a hedge of commodity price risk in a situation in which the commodity is priced at a discount to the benchmark commodity price.
All retrospective assessments were required to be performed using quantitative methods.
as a result, there was often little or no link between hedge accounting and the risk management strategy; and
The IASB proposed that a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements if it
meets the objective of the hedge effectiveness assessment (ie that the hedging relationship will produce an unbiased result and minimise expected hedge ineffectiveness); and
is expected to achieve other than accidental offsetting.
Those respondents also supported the IASB in avoiding the use of bright lines in hedge accounting generally and the move towards a more principle-based effectiveness assessment.
They also believed that an approach that was completely principle-based would generate operational difficulties and would have the potential to inappropriately extend the application of hedge accounting.
The objective of the hedge effectiveness assessment
The IASB noted that this resulted in hedge accounting that was considered by some as arbitrary and onerous.
Consequently, it made it difficult to explain the results of hedge accounting to users of financial statements.
The IASB's intention was that the assessment should not be based on a particular level of hedge effectiveness.
This assessment would have been based on an analysis of the possible behaviour of the hedging relationship during its term to ascertain whether it could be expected to meet the risk management objective.
The IASB believed that the proposed approach would therefore have strengthened the relationship between hedge accounting and risk management practice.
BC6.241 The IASB noted that many types of hedging relationships inevitably involve some ineffectiveness that cannot be eliminated.
For example, ineffectiveness could arise because of differences in the underlyings or other differences between the hedging instrument and the hedged item that the entity accepts in order to achieve a cost-effective hedging relationship.
The IASB considered that when an entity establishes a hedging relationship there should be no expectation that changes in the value of the hedging instrument will systematically either exceed or be less than the change in value of the hedged item.
would not take into account that, in many situations, entities do not use a hedging instrument that would make the hedging relationship 'perfectly effective'.
They noted that entities use hedging instruments that do not achieve perfect hedge effectiveness because the 'perfect' hedging instrument is
not cost-effective as a hedge (compared to a standardised instrument that is cheaper and/or more liquid, but does not provide the perfect fit).
could be interpreted as a mathematical optimisation exercise.
In other words, they were concerned that it would require entities to search for the perfect hedging relationship at inception (and on a continuous basis), because if they did not, the results could be considered to be biased and hedge ineffectiveness would probably not be 'minimised'.
BC6.243 In the light of the concerns about the use of hedging instruments that are not 'perfectly effective', the IASB noted that the appropriate hedge ratio was primarily a risk management decision instead of an accounting decision.
When determining the appropriate hedge ratio, risk management would take into consideration, among other things, the following factors
the availability of hedging instruments and the underlyings of those hedging instruments (and, as a consequence, the level of the risk of differences in value changes involved between the hedged item and the hedging instrument);
the tolerance levels in relation to expected sources of hedge ineffectiveness (which determine when the hedging relationship is adjusted for risk management purposes); and
the costs of hedging (including the costs of adjusting an existing hedging relationship).
In other words, the IASB did not intend that an entity would have to consider the hedge effectiveness and related hedge ratio that could have been achieved with a different hedging instrument that might have been a better fit for the hedged risk if it did not enter into that hedging instrument.
In particular, the IASB considered the effect of its proposal in situations in which a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument only after its inception so that it is already in or out of the money at the time of its designation (often colloquially referred to as a 'late hedge').
The IASB considered whether the hedge ratio would have to be adjusted to take into account the (non-zero) fair value of the derivative at the time of its designation.
This is because the fair value of the hedging instrument at the time of its designation is a present value.
Over the remaining life of the hedging instrument this present value will accrete to the undiscounted amount (the 'unwinding of the discount').
The IASB noted that there is no offsetting fair value change in the hedged item for this effect (unless the hedged item was also in or out of the money in an equal but opposite way).
Consequently, in situations in which the derivative is designated as the hedging instrument after its inception, an entity would expect that the changes in the value of the hedging instrument will systematically either exceed or be less than the changes in the value of the hedged item (ie the hedge ratio would not be 'unbiased').
To meet the proposed objective of the hedge effectiveness assessment an entity would need to explore whether it could adjust the hedge ratio to avoid the systematic difference between the value changes of the hedging instrument and the hedged item over the hedging period.
However, to determine the ratio that would avoid that systematic difference, an entity would need to know what the actual price or rate of the underlying will be at the end of the hedging relationship.
Hence, the IASB noted that the proposed objective of the hedge effectiveness assessment could be interpreted to the effect that, in the (quite common) situations in which an entity has a 'late hedge', the proposed hedge effectiveness requirements would not be met.
This is because the entity would not be able to identify a hedge ratio for the designation of the hedging relationship that would not involve an expectation that the changes in value of the hedging instrument will systematically either exceed or be less than the changes in the value of the hedged item.
BC6.246 The IASB noted that the feedback about the requirement that the hedging relationship should minimise hedge ineffectiveness suggested that identifying a 'minimum' would involve considerable effort in all situations in which the terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not fully matched.
Furthermore, regardless of the effort involved, it would be difficult to demonstrate that the 'minimum' had been identified.
entities would not deliberately create a difference between the quantity actually hedged and the quantity designated as the hedged item in order to achieve a particular accounting outcome; and
an entity would not inappropriately designate a hedging relationship such that it would give rise to systematic hedge ineffectiveness, which could be avoided by a more appropriate designation.
The IASB noted that both aspects could result in undermining the 'lower of' test for cash flow hedges or achieving fair value hedge adjustments on a greater quantity of the hedged item than an entity actually hedged (ie fair value accounting would be disproportionately expanded compared to the quantity actually hedged).
Instead, the IASB decided to state, more directly, that the entity's designation of the hedging relationship shall use a hedge ratio based on
the quantity of the hedged item that it actually hedges; and
the quantity of the hedging instrument that it actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.
the use of the hedge ratio resulting from the requirement in this Standard provides information about the hedge ineffectiveness in situations in which an entity uses a hedging instrument that does not provide the best fit (for example, because of cost-efficiency considerations).
it also aligns hedge accounting with risk management and hence is consistent with the overall objective of the new hedge accounting model.
However, from an accounting perspective, this would not lead to any advantage because it would create fair value changes for the hedging instrument that affect profit or loss for both fair value hedges and cash flow hedges.
The result of an entity using an excess quantity of the hedging instrument would therefore solely be the presentation of fair value changes within profit or loss as hedge ineffectiveness instead of other or trading gains or losses.
This would increase the hedge ineffectiveness in an entity's financial statements while having no impact on overall profit or loss.
From an accounting perspective, this might create an advantage for fair value hedges if an entity wanted to achieve fair value hedge adjustments on a greater quantity of 'hedged items' than it would achieve when using an appropriate hedge ratio.
In addition, for cash flow hedges, an entity could abuse the lower of test because the hedge ineffectiveness arising from the larger change in fair value on the hedged item compared to that on the hedging instrument would not be recognised.
Consequently, even though using a 'deficit' quantity of the hedging instrument would not be economically advantageous, from an accounting perspective it might have the desired outcome for an entity.
Given its decision to remove that bright line (see paragraph BC6.237), the IASB decided to explicitly address this potential for abuse.
As a consequence, this Standard requires that, for the purpose of hedge accounting, an entity shall not designate a hedging relationship in a manner that reflects an imbalance between the weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that would create hedge ineffectiveness (irrespective of whether recognised or not) that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting.
Consequently, the IASB proposed replacing the bright line test with a notion that aims to reflect the way entities look at the design and monitoring of hedging relationships from a risk management perspective.
Inherent in this was the notion of 'other than accidental offsetting'.
This linked the risk management perspective with the hedge accounting model's general notion of offset between gains and losses on hedging instruments and hedged items.
The IASB also considered that this link reflected the intention that the effectiveness assessment should not be based on a particular level of effectiveness (hence avoiding a new bright line).
BC6.254 The IASB noted that qualifying criteria that use terminology such as 'other than accidental offsetting' can be abstract.
The feedback suggested that this makes the relevant aspects or elements of the hedge effectiveness assessment more difficult to understand.
BC6.255 Consequently, the IASB decided to replace the term 'other than accidental offsetting' with requirements that better conveyed its original notion
Those respondents believed that, in order to meet the hedge effectiveness criteria, a hedging relationship should be required to be 'reasonably effective' in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
The IASB considered that moving, instead of removing, the threshold would not address the root cause of the problem (see paragraph BC6.237).
The suggested approach would instead only change the level of the threshold.
The IASB considered that, even though the threshold would be of a qualitative nature, it would still create a danger of reverting back to a quantitative measure (such as the percentage range of IAS 39) in order for it to be operational.
BC6.260 Furthermore, the IASB was concerned that using the single term 'reasonably effective' would mingle different aspects, which would be tantamount to aggregating the different aspects of the effectiveness assessment that the IASB had considered (ie the economic relationship, the effect of credit risk and the hedge ratio).
The IASB noted that it was clear from feedback received on its proposed objective of the hedge effectiveness assessment that a single term was too abstract if the notion described by that term included a number of different aspects (see also paragraph BC6.254).
Frequency of assessing whether the hedge effectiveness requirements are met
The IASB decided that an entity should perform this assessment at the inception of the hedging relationship.
BC6.263 Furthermore, the IASB considered that an entity should assess, on an ongoing basis, whether the hedge effectiveness requirements are still met, including any adjustment (rebalancing) that might be required in order to continue to meet those requirements (see paragraphs BC6.300–BC6.313).
This was because the proposed hedge effectiveness requirements should be met throughout the term of the hedging relationship.
Method of assessing hedge effectiveness
BC6.266 The method used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship needs to be suitable to demonstrate that the objective of the hedge effectiveness assessment has been achieved.
The IASB considered whether the effectiveness of a hedging relationship should be assessed on either a qualitative or a quantitative basis.
If there are no substantial changes in the critical terms or in the credit risk of the hedging instrument or hedged item, the hedge effectiveness can typically be determined using a qualitative assessment.
These hedging relationships involve an increased level of uncertainty about the degree of offset and so the effectiveness of the hedge during its term is more difficult to evaluate.
The IASB considered that, in the context of an effectiveness assessment that does not use a threshold, it can be appropriate to assess the effectiveness qualitatively for a hedging relationship for which the terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item match or are closely aligned.
The IASB considered that a quantitative assessment would be more suitable in such situations.
BC6.270 Quantitative assessments or tests encompass a wide spectrum of tools and techniques.
The IASB noted that selecting the appropriate tool or technique depends on the complexity of the hedge, the availability of data and the level of uncertainty of offset in the hedging relationship.
The type of assessment and the method used to assess hedge effectiveness therefore depends on the relevant characteristics of the hedging relationship.
However, the IASB decided not to prescribe any specific method of assessing hedge effectiveness.
Hedge of a foreign currency risk of a firm commitment
BC6.273 The IASB noted that requiring an entity to apply cash flow hedge accounting for all hedges of foreign currency risk of a firm commitment could result in what some regard as 'artificial' other comprehensive income and equity volatility (see paragraphs BC6.353–BC6.354).
The IASB also noted that, by requiring an entity to apply cash flow hedge accounting, the lower of test would apply to transactions that already exist (ie firm commitments).
BC6.274 However, the IASB also noted that requiring an entity to apply fair value hedge accounting for all hedges of foreign currency risk of a firm commitment would require a change in the type of hedging relationship to a fair value hedge when the foreign currency cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction becomes a hedge of a firm commitment.
For example, this would require changing the measurement of ineffectiveness from a 'lower of' test to a symmetrical test.
BC6.275 The IASB also noted that for existing hedged items (such as firm commitments) foreign currency risk affects both the cash flows and the fair value of the hedged item and hence has a dual character.
Measuring the ineffectiveness of a hedging relationship
BC6.281 The IASB noted that hedging instruments are subject to measurement either at fair value or amortised cost, both of which are present value measurements.
Consequently, in order to be consistent, the amounts that are compared with the changes in the value of the hedging instrument must also be determined on a present value basis.
The IASB noted that hedge accounting does not change the measurement of the hedging instrument, but that it might change only the location of where the change in its carrying amount is presented.
As a result, the same basis (ie present value) for the hedged item must be used in order to avoid a mismatch when determining the amount to be recognised as hedge ineffectiveness.
The IASB considered the use of a hypothetical derivative in the context of the hedge effectiveness assessment as well as for the purpose of measuring hedge ineffectiveness.
BC6.285 The IASB noted that the purpose of a hypothetical derivative is to measure the change in the value of the hedged item. Consequently, a hypothetical derivative is not a method in its own right for assessing hedge effectiveness or measuring hedge ineffectiveness.
This allows determining changes in the value of the hedged item against which the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are compared to assess hedge effectiveness and measure ineffectiveness.
The main reasons cited for disagreement were
Unlike fair value hedges, cash flow hedges are not based on a valuation concept and therefore do not give rise to hedge ineffectiveness from differences in value changes between the hedging instrument and the hedged item as long as their variable cash flows match.
The foreign currency basis spread is also a cost of hedging and should be treated consistently with the other types of costs of hedging.
BC6.288 The IASB considered whether a cash flow hedge is a different concept from a fair value hedge.
Consequently, simply comparing the cash flow variability of the hedging instrument and the hedged item (ie a pure 'flow perspective' without involving a valuation) was not appropriate.
BC6.289 The IASB also noted that IFRS uses a hedge accounting model that does not allow perfect hedge effectiveness to be assumed, and that this applies even if for a cash flow hedge the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item perfectly match.
Doing so could conceal differences in credit risk or liquidity of the hedging instrument and the hedged item, which are potential sources of hedge ineffectiveness for fair value hedges and cash flow hedges alike.
BC6.290 The IASB therefore rejected the view that cash flow hedges and fair value hedges were different concepts in that the former represented a mere comparison of cash flows whereas only the latter represented a comparison of valuations.
Consequently, the IASB also rejected the view that a hypothetical derivative is meant to represent the 'perfect hedge' instead of the hedged item.
Instead, the IASB confirmed its view that for fair value hedges and cash flow hedges the hedge accounting model
is a valuation model; and
requires that the value of the hedged item is measured independently of the value of the hedging instrument.
But this objective did not mean that an entity could override accounting requirements with its particular risk management view.
BC6.292 Consequently, the IASB rejected the view that if risk management considered cash flow hedges as fully effective when the variable cash flows of the actual derivative match those of the hedged item (ie if the entity uses a 'perfect derivative') that hedge should also be considered as fully effective for accounting purposes.
BC6.293 The IASB then considered the concern that the accounting treatment for the effect of a foreign currency basis spread was inconsistent with that for the time value of options and the forward element of forward contracts, ie the notion of 'costs of hedging' that the new hedge accounting model introduces.
BC6.294 The IASB noted that its proposals would result in hedge ineffectiveness arising from the fair value changes of the hedging instrument that are attributable to the effect of a foreign currency basis spread.
Instead, any exchange of the debt instrument's currency of denomination for another currency was a circumstance of the holder or issuer of that debt instrument instead of a characteristic or feature of the debt instrument itself.
Those factors include, for example, the credit risk embedded in the underlying reference rates of the currencies as well as the demand and supply for the particular financial product (for example, cross-currency interest rate swaps), which relates to specific situations in foreign currency (product) markets.
Also, the interaction between the spot and the forward foreign currency markets can sometimes have an effect.
The IASB therefore decided to expand the notion of 'costs of hedging' so as to include foreign currency basis spreads.
In the IASB's view, this would provide the most transparent accounting, reflect best the economics of the transaction and fit into the new hedge accounting model.
BC6.297 The IASB also considered whether it should expand the notion of 'costs of hedging' by broadening the exception it had proposed for the time value of options and the forward element of forward contracts or by replacing that exception with a broader principle.
The IASB acknowledged that, conceptually, a principle would be preferable but it was concerned that using a broader principle for the costs of hedging could result in some types of hedge ineffectiveness being inappropriately deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income as costs of hedging.
The IASB noted that for hedges of transaction related hedged items, using the forward rate method to measure the hedged item would allow entities to achieve an equivalent accounting outcome for the forward element of forward contracts (see paragraphs BC6.418–BC6.420).
However, the IASB acknowledged that in order to allow a similar accounting outcome not only for the forward element of forward contracts but also for foreign currency basis spreads, entities would need to be able to apply the notion of 'costs of hedging', including for hedges of transaction related hedged items.
Consequently, the IASB introduced the notion of 'costs of hedging' also for those types of cost of hedging for both hedges of time-period related hedged items and for hedges of transaction related hedged items.
The IASB noted that this resulted from a hedge accounting model that did not include the notion of accounting for changes to an existing hedging relationship as a continuation of that relationship.
BC6.301 The IASB noted that this is inconsistent with risk management practices.
There are instances where, although the risk management objective remains the same, adjustments to an existing hedging relationship are made because of changes in circumstances related to the hedging relationship's underlyings or risk variables.
For example, such adjustments are often required to re-align the hedging relationship with risk management policies in view of changed circumstances.
Hence, those adjustments to the hedged item or hedging instrument do not change the original risk management objective but instead reflect a change in how it is executed owing to the changes in circumstances.
The IASB considered that in those situations the revised hedging relationship should be accounted for as a continuation of the existing hedging relationship.
The IASB referred to such adjustments of hedging relationships as 'rebalancing'.
BC6.303 The IASB concluded that, in such situations, if the original risk management objective remained unaltered, the adjustment to the hedging relationship should be treated as the continuation of the hedging relationship.
Consequently, the IASB proposed that an adjustment to a hedging relationship is treated as a rebalancing when that adjustment changes the hedge ratio in response to changes in the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument but risk management otherwise continues the originally designated hedging relationship.
BC6.304 However, if the adjustment represents an overhaul of the existing hedging relationship, the IASB considered that treating the adjustment as a rebalancing would not be appropriate.
Instead, the IASB considered that such an adjustment should result in the discontinuation of that hedging relationship.
An example is a hedging relationship with a hedging instrument that experiences a severe deterioration of its credit quality and hence is no longer used for risk management purposes.
Respondents thought that the inclusion of the concept of rebalancing would enhance the application of hedge accounting and would be a better representation of what entities do as part of their risk management activities.
However, some respondents requested that the IASB clarify the circumstances in which rebalancing is required or permitted.
This was because of cost-effectiveness considerations or simply because the hedge was still within the tolerance limits that an entity might use for adjusting the hedging relationship.
Consequently, almost all respondents (directly or indirectly) requested that the IASB clarify that rebalancing should only be required when done for risk management purposes.
whether rebalancing should be mandatory or voluntary; and
This decision resulted in designating hedging relationships using a hedge ratio based on the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that it actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.
However, this is provided that the hedge ratio would not reflect an imbalance that would create hedge ineffectiveness that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting (see paragraphs BC6.248–BC6.251).
The IASB considered that this decision addressed the main concerns respondents had about rebalancing (ie how rebalancing for hedge accounting purposes related to rebalancing for risk management purposes).
Consequently, the IASB considered that the notion of proactive rebalancing had become obsolete.
Clarification of the term 'rebalancing
However, the IASB considered whether it also needed to provide clarification on the scope of rebalancing — in other words, what adjustments to a hedging relationship constitute rebalancing.
BC6.313 Consequently, the IASB decided to clarify that rebalancing only covers adjustments to the designated quantities of the hedged item or of the hedging instrument for the purpose of maintaining a hedge ratio that complies with the requirements of the hedge effectiveness assessment (ie not when the entity simply wants to hedge more or less than it did originally).
Mandatory or voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting
For example, entities revoked the designation of a hedging relationship and re-designated it as a new hedging relationship in order to apply a different method of assessing hedge ineffectiveness from the method originally documented (expecting that the new method would be a better fit).
Another example was entities that revoked the designation of a hedging relationship because they wanted to adjust the hedge ratio following a change in the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument (typically in response to a change in the relationship between different underlyings).
The hedging relationship was then re-designated, including the adjustment to the volume of the hedging instrument or the hedged item, in order to achieve the new hedge ratio.
The IASB noted that in those situations the hedging relationship was discontinued and then restarted even though the risk management objective of the entity had not changed.
the new hedge effectiveness assessment requirements would not involve a percentage band or any other bright line criterion and would result in changing the method for assessing hedge effectiveness in response to changes in circumstances as part of a continuing hedging relationship; and
the notion of rebalancing would allow the hedge ratio to be adjusted as part of a continuing hedging relationship.
BC6.317 The IASB also noted that sometimes a hedging relationship was discontinued because of a decrease in the hedged quantities of forecast transactions (ie the volume that remains highly probable of occurring falls or is expected to fall below the volume designated as the hedged item).
The IASB considered that the quantity of forecast transactions that were still highly probable of occurring was in fact a continuation of the original hedging relationship (albeit with a lower volume).
In the IASB's view, this would more closely align hedge accounting with risk management and provide more useful information.
BC6.318 However, the IASB was concerned that this accounting might possibly undermine the requirement that forecast transactions must be highly probable in order to qualify as a hedged item.
Hence, the IASB decided to also propose to clarify that a history of having designated hedges of forecast transactions and having subsequently determined that the forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur would call into question the entity's ability to predict similar forecast transactions accurately.
This would affect the assessment of whether similar forecast transactions are highly probable and hence their eligibility as hedged items.
BC6.319 In view of its aim to better link hedge accounting to risk management and provide more useful hedge accounting information, the IASB also discussed whether it should retain an entity's choice to revoke the designation of a hedging relationship, taking into consideration that the designation of a hedging relationship (and hence the discontinuation of hedge accounting) at will does not result in useful information.
The IASB noted that this would allow hedge accounting to be discontinued even if the entity for risk management purposes continued to hedge the exposure in accordance with its risk management objective that was part of the qualifying criteria that initially allowed the entity to achieve hedge accounting.
The IASB also noted that if the hedging relationship no longer reflected the risk management objective for that particular hedging relationship, discontinuation of hedge accounting was not a choice but was required because the qualifying criteria would no longer be met.
The IASB considered that applying hedge accounting without a risk management objective would not provide useful information.
Those who agreed thought that the proposals would strengthen the reliability of financial reporting because the ability to change accounting for no valid reason would be reduced.
They noted that allowing a hedging relationship to be arbitrarily discontinued at any point in time is not conceptually sound and does not result in useful information.
BC6.323 Even though many respondents agreed with the proposals, there were also requests that the IASB provide additional guidance on the meaning of 'risk management' and at what level it should be considered for the purpose of hedge accounting.
BC6.324 Generally, those who disagreed with the proposals argued that if starting hedge accounting was voluntary, ceasing it should also be voluntary.
Some respondents who disagreed did so because they believed that voluntary discontinuation was necessary in scenarios in which an entity decided to terminate a hedging relationship on the basis that the hedge was no longer cost efficient (for example, a high administrative burden makes it is too onerous and costly to apply hedge accounting).
Some of these respondents raised the concern that voluntary discontinuation was an important tool in the current hedge accounting model for financial institutions that normally run hedging programmes based on portfolios of items on a macro basis.
Those portfolios were subject to constant changes and entities removed the hedge designation with the aim of adjusting the hedging relationship for new hedged items and hedging instruments.
BC6.325 Others who disagreed argued that not allowing voluntary discontinuation was inconsistent with the mechanics of cash flow hedge accounting.
For example, when an entity entered into a cash flow hedge for forecast sales in a foreign currency, the risk management strategy aimed to protect the cash flows until settlement of the invoice.
Those respondents thought that voluntary discontinuation of the hedging relationship was necessary at the time that the forecast transaction became an on-balance-sheet item (for example, a trade receivable).
BC6.326 Based on this feedback, the IASB, in its redeliberations, considered
whether voluntary discontinuation should be allowed, given that hedge accounting remained optional; and
how the link of the proposed discontinuation requirements to the risk management objective and strategy would work.
BC6.327 The IASB noted that even though the application of hedge accounting remained optional, it facilitated the provision of useful information for financial reporting purposes (ie how hedging instruments are used to manage risk).
The IASB considered that this purpose could not be ignored when considering the voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting.
If an entity chose to apply hedge accounting, it did so with the aim of using that particular accounting to represent in the financial statements the effect of pursuing a particular risk management objective.
If the risk management objective had not changed and the other qualifying criteria for hedge accounting were still met, the ability to discontinue hedge accounting would undermine the aspect of consistency over time in accounting for, and providing information about, that hedging relationship.
The IASB noted that a free choice to discontinue hedge accounting reflected a view that hedge accounting is a mere accounting exercise that does not have a particular meaning.
Consequently, the IASB considered that it was not valid to argue that because hedge accounting was voluntary, the discontinuation of hedge accounting should also be voluntary.
the lessee's option to account for a property interest held under an operating lease as an investment property, which is available (irrevocably) on a property-by-property basis.
BC6.329 The IASB also did not think that the ability to voluntarily discontinue hedge accounting was necessary for hedge accounting to work as intended in particular situations mentioned in the feedback (see paragraphs BC6.324–BC6.325).
The IASB considered that the impression of some respondents that voluntary discontinuation was necessary in those situations resulted from a lack of clarity about the distinction between the notions of risk management strategy and risk management objective.
The IASB noted that that distinction was important for determining when the discontinuation of a hedging relationship was required (or not allowed).
In other words, the risk management strategy typically identified the risks to which the entity was exposed and set out how the entity responded to them.
In other words, it related to how the particular designated hedging instrument is used to hedge the particular exposure designated as the hedged item.
Hence, the risk management objective for a particular hedging relationship could change even though an entity's risk management strategy remained unchanged.
The IASB's intention was to prohibit voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting when the risk management objective at the level of a particular hedging relationship (ie not only the risk management strategy) remained the same and all other qualifying criteria were still met.
Thus, the original derivative with Party B has expired and, as a consequence, the original derivative through which Party A has engaged with Party B meets the derecognition criteria for a financial asset.
The IASB noted that the novation to the CCP would release Party A from the responsibility to make payments to Party B and would also oblige Party A to make payments to the CCP.
Consequently, the original derivative through which Party A has transacted with Party B also meets the derecognition criteria for a financial liability.
BC6.337 Taking into account the conclusion of the assessment on the derecognition requirements, the IASB considered the guidance it had proposed on the discontinuation of hedge accounting, which would require an entity to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
However, the IASB noted that, in practice, other changes may arise as a direct consequence of the novation.
Such narrow changes that are a direct consequence of, or are incidental to, the novation were acknowledged in the proposals.
However, this would not include changes to, for example, the maturity of the derivatives, the payment dates or the contractual cash flows or the basis of their calculation, except for changes that may arise as a consequence of transacting with a CCP.
The IASB considered that it was not appropriate to mandate a specific disclosure in this situation because, from the perspective of a user of financial statements, hedge accounting would continue.
BC6.344 The vast majority of respondents agreed that the proposed revisions are necessary.
In expressing such disagreement some noted that the guidance on the discontinuation of hedge accounting expressly acknowledges that certain replacements or rollovers of hedging instruments are not expirations or terminations for the purposes of discontinuing hedge accounting.
The IASB questioned whether replacement of a contract as a result of unforeseen legislative changes (even if documented) fits the definition of a replacement that is part of a 'documented risk management objective'.
BC6.346 When considering respondents' comments, the IASB noted that voluntary novation to a CCP could be prevalent in some circumstances such as novation in anticipation of regulatory changes, novation owing to operational ease, and novation induced but not actually mandated by laws or regulations as a result of the imposition of charges or penalties.
BC6.347 The IASB observed, however, that for hedge accounting to continue, voluntary novation to a CCP should be associated with laws or regulations that are relevant to central clearing of derivatives.
In addition, the IASB agreed that hedge accounting should continue when novations are performed as a consequence of laws or regulations or the introduction of laws or regulations but noted that the mere possibility of laws or regulations being introduced was not a sufficient basis for the continuation of hedge accounting.
In addition, the IASB observed that an intragroup novation can also occur in order to access a CCP; for example, if only particular group entities can transact directly with a CCP.
The IASB decided that in those circumstances the novation had occurred in order to effect clearing through a CCP, albeit indirectly.
The IASB thus decided to also include such novations in the scope of the amendments because they are consistent with the objective of the proposed amendments — they enable hedge accounting to continue when novations occur as a consequence of laws or regulations or the introduction of laws or regulations that increase the use of CCPs.
The IASB noted that this would have the effect of requiring an analysis of whether the general conditions for the continuation of hedge accounting are satisfied in other cases (for example, as was raised by some respondents, in determining the effect of intragroup novations in consolidated financial statements).
However, the IASB noted that an entity may consider disclosures in accordance with IFRS 7, which requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures about credit risk.
The IASB noted that even with retrospective application, if an entity had previously discontinued hedge accounting as a result of a novation, that (pre-novation) hedge accounting relationship could not be reinstated because doing so would be inconsistent with the requirements for hedge accounting (ie hedge accounting cannot be applied retrospectively).
Accounting for fair value hedges
Such an approach would recognise gains or losses on the hedging instruments outside profit or loss in other comprehensive income instead of requiring the hedged item to be remeasured.
The IASB considered such an approach because it would
improve the usefulness of the reported information for users of financial statements.
In accordance with such an approach, all hedging activities to which hedge accounting is applied (including hedges of fair value risk) would be reflected in other comprehensive income, resulting in greater transparency and comparability.
In addition, the measurement of the hedged item would not be affected.
Although fair value and cash flow hedge accounting are designed to address different exposures, the same mechanisms can be used to reflect how an entity manages these exposures in the financial statements.
Such an approach would align fair value hedge accounting and cash flow hedge accounting, resulting in a single method for hedge accounting.
Some supported the approach for the reasons that the IASB had considered, which was consistent with the feedback received on the Discussion Paper Reducing Complexity in Reporting Financial Instruments.
However, others raised concerns that such an approach
would not reflect the underlying economics.
They argued that if an entity applies a fair value hedge, the hedged item exists and hence there is an actual gain or loss on the hedged item (not just an anticipated gain or loss on a forecast transaction that does not yet exist).
Consequently, hedge accounting should not cause 'artificial' volatility in other comprehensive income and equity.
would make the movements in other comprehensive income less understandable.
would make it difficult to identify the type of risk management strategy that the entity employs.
could result in scenarios in which equity would be significantly reduced or even negative because of losses on the hedging instrument deferred in other comprehensive income.
This could have serious implications in terms of solvency and regulatory requirements.
However, the IASB proposed some changes to the presentation and mechanics of fair value hedge accounting
The IASB proposed to require the recognition of the gain or loss in other comprehensive income.
The IASB proposed to require the gain or loss to be recognised as an asset or a liability that is presented in a separate line item in the statement of financial position and in other comprehensive income.
That separate line item would have been presented within assets (or liabilities) for those reporting periods for which the hedged item is an asset (or a liability).
BC6.356 The IASB noted that the separate line item represented measurement adjustments to the hedged items instead of separate assets or liabilities in their own right.
The IASB thought that the additional line item might be perceived to add complexity and would increase the number of line items in the statement of financial position.
In addition, the IASB noted that this approach is more complex than the approach initially considered, which would have eliminated fair value hedge accounting mechanics.
BC6.357 However, the IASB decided to propose these changes because they would
eliminate the mixed measurement for the hedged item (for example, an amount that is amortised cost with a partial fair value adjustment).
avoid volatility in other comprehensive income and equity that some consider artificial.
provide information in the statement of comprehensive income about the extent of the offsetting achieved for fair value hedges.
As an alternative, those respondents suggested that entities disclose the accumulated adjustment made to the carrying amount of the hedged item in the notes to the financial statements.
Linked presentation for fair value hedges
In response to that concern, the IASB considered whether applying linked presentation for fair value hedges of firm commitments might be appropriate.
Linked presentation is a way of presenting information so that it shows how particular assets and liabilities are related.
Linked presentation is not the same as offsetting, which presents a net asset or liability.
Linked presentation displays the 'gross' amount of related items in the statement of financial position (while the net amount is included in the total for assets or liabilities).
BC6.363 The industry was concerned that the presentation resulting from fair value hedge accounting would not reflect the economic effects of hedges of foreign currency risk.
The fair value of the derivative liability (asset) and the firm commitment asset (liability) could be significant depending on the volatility of the currency being hedged.
That industry was concerned that, as a result, on the basis of the statement of financial position, the entity would appear to be exposed to a higher risk than it actually was.
In that industry's view, confusion might arise because the statement of financial position would show large amounts for total assets and total liabilities and hence a high leverage (which typically suggests higher risk) even though the entity hedged the foreign currency risk of the firm commitment and thus sought to reduce risk.
BC6.365 Moreover, that industry argued that a firm commitment is recognised in the statement of financial position only when fair value hedge accounting is applied.
That industry also argued that totals for assets and liabilities that include only the 'net' amount (of the linked transactions) would be most appropriate for financial analysis purposes.
That industry believed that the ratios, such as leverage, should be calculated on the basis of the difference between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, ie the net amount instead of the gross amount of those items.
BC6.366 The IASB noted that while linked presentation could provide some useful information about a particular relationship between an asset and a liability, it does not differentiate between the types of risk that are covered by that relationship and those that are not.
Instead, the IASB believed that disclosures about hedging would be a better alternative for providing information that allows users of financial statements to assess the relevance of the information for their own analysis.
Some respondents also thought that linked presentation is not an appropriate topic for a project on hedge accounting, but instead that it should be considered as a separate project or as part of a project on either financial statement presentation or the Conceptual Framework.
BC6.369 However, those respondents that supported linked presentation argued that, without it, entities that use hedge accounting would be perceived to be riskier than those that do not, and that the true economic effects of hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments would not be reflected.
BC6.370 The IASB noted that in the absence of a clear principle for linked presentation, it should be considered in a broader context than just hedge accounting.
Consequently, the IASB decided not to require or allow the use of linked presentation for the purpose of hedge accounting.
BC6.371 When a hedge accounting relationship is fully effective, the fair value changes of the hedging instrument perfectly offset the value changes of the hedged item.
Hedge ineffectiveness arises when the value changes of the hedging instrument exceed those of the hedged item, or when the value changes of the hedging instrument are less than those of the hedged item.
Those hedged items do not yet exist although they are expected to occur in the future.
Hence, recognising gains and losses on those items in excess of the gains and losses on the hedging instrument is tantamount to recognising gains and losses on items that do not yet exist (instead of a deferral of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument).
The IASB noted that this would be conceptually questionable as well as a counter-intuitive outcome.
The 'lower of' test ensured that cumulative changes in the value of the hedged items that exceed cumulative fair value changes of the hedging instrument are not recognised.
In contrast, the lower of test did not apply to fair value hedges because, for that type of hedge, the hedged item exists.
For example, while a firm commitment might not be recognised in accordance with IFRS, the transaction already exists.
Conversely, a forecast transaction does not yet exist but will occur only in the future.
The IASB noted that the requirements could be aligned by also applying the lower of test to fair value hedges or by eliminating it for cash flow hedges.
In the IASB's view, aligning the requirements would reduce complexity.
However, the IASB considered that, for conceptual reasons, recognising gains and losses on items that do not yet exist instead of only deferring the gain or loss on the hedging instrument was not appropriate.
On the other hand, the IASB considered that the nature of fair value hedges is different from that of cash flow hedges.
Also applying the lower of test to fair value hedges, even though that test was designed to address only the specific characteristics of cash flow hedges, was not justified.
Consequently, the IASB decided to retain the lower of test for cash flow hedges and not to introduce it for fair value hedges.
Similarly, a forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or non-financial liability could subsequently result in the recognition of a firm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied.
to reclassify the associated gains or losses that were recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss; or
to remove the associated gains or losses that were recognised in other comprehensive income and include them in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
This approach was commonly referred to as a 'basis adjustment'.
The IASB noted that if an entity was precluded from applying a basis adjustment, this would require the entity to track the hedging gains and losses separately (after the hedging relationship had ended) and to match them to the period or periods in which the non-financial item that had resulted from the hedged transaction affected profit or loss.
In contrast, if an entity applied a basis adjustment, the hedging gain or loss was included in the carrying amount of the non-financial item and automatically recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the related non-financial item affected profit or loss (for example, through depreciation expense for items of property, plant and equipment or cost of sales for inventories).
It would also be automatically considered when an entity tested a non-financial asset for impairment.
The IASB noted that for a non-financial asset that is tested for impairment as part of a cash-generating unit, tracking amounts in other comprehensive income and including them in the impairment test is difficult (even more so if the composition of cash-generating units changes over time).
BC6.377 The IASB acknowledged that there were different views on whether a basis adjustment would achieve or reduce comparability.
From this viewpoint, basis adjustments would impair comparability.
For example, Entity A and Entity B want to purchase the same asset from a supplier that has a different functional currency.
Entity A is able to secure the purchase contract denominated in its functional currency.
Conversely, while Entity B also wants to fix the purchase price in its functional currency, it has to accept a purchase contract denominated in the functional currency of the supplier (ie a foreign currency) and is therefore exposed to the variability in cash flows arising from movements in the exchange rate.
Hence, Entity B hedges its exposure to foreign currency risk using a currency forward contract which, in effect, fixes the price of the purchase in its functional currency.
The IASB noted that for hedges of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment the basis adjustment at the end of the cash flow hedge has the same effect on the presentation of the hedged item as accounting for the hedge as a fair value hedge.
Thus, using fair value hedge accounting for those firm commitments was tantamount to a basis adjustment.
The IASB thought that, in this context, basis adjustments would also enhance comparability.
The IASB decided that when the entity removes the associated gain or loss that was recognised in other comprehensive income in order to include it in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability, that gain or loss should be directly applied against the carrying amount of the asset or liability.
The IASB noted that accounting for the basis adjustment as a reclassification adjustment would distort comprehensive income because the amount would affect comprehensive income twice but in different periods
again in the later periods when the non-financial item affects profit or loss (for example, through depreciation expense or cost of sales).
The IASB also noted that presenting a basis adjustment as a reclassification adjustment would create the misleading impression that the basis adjustment was a performance event.
BC6.381 The IASB acknowledged that the total comprehensive income across periods will be distorted because the gain or loss on the hedging instrument during the period of the cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, whereas the cumulative hedging gain or loss that is removed from the cash flow hedge reserve (ie from equity) and directly applied to the subsequently recognised non-financial item does not affect other comprehensive income.
The IASB concluded that, on balance, the effect of a reclassification adjustment in the period of the basis adjustment would be more misleading than the effect over the total period of not using a reclassification adjustment.
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
to designate an option-type derivative as a hedging instrument in its entirety; or
Consequently, the undesignated time value of the option was treated as held for trading and was accounted for as at fair value through profit or loss, which gave rise to significant volatility in profit or loss.
This particular accounting treatment is disconnected from the risk management view, whereby entities typically consider the time value of an option (at inception, ie included in the premium paid) as a cost of hedging.
It is a cost of obtaining protection against unfavourable changes of prices, while retaining participation in any favourable changes.
The IASB noted that the standard-setting debate about accounting for the time value of options had historically been focused on hedge ineffectiveness.
Many typical hedged transactions (such as firm commitments, forecast transactions or existing items) do not involve a time value notion because they are not options.
Hence, such hedged items do not have a change in their value that offsets the fair value change related to the time value of the option that is used as a hedging instrument.
The IASB concluded that, unless the time value of the option was excluded from being designated as the hedging instrument, hedge ineffectiveness would arise.
In order to protect themselves against the downside of an exposure (an adverse outcome) while retaining the upside, they have to compensate someone else for assuming the inverse asymmetrical position, which has only the downside but not the upside.
This explains why entities typically view the premium paid as being similar to an insurance premium and hence as a cost of using this hedging strategy.
Hence, the IASB considered that aligning the accounting for the time value of options with such other areas would provide more comparable results that would also be more aligned with how preparers and users of financial statements think about the issue.
transaction related (for example, the forecast purchase of a commodity); or
time-period related (for example, hedging an existing commodity inventory for commodity price changes).
BC6.393 The IASB considered that for transaction related hedged items the cumulative change in fair value of the option's time value should be accumulated in other comprehensive income and be reclassified in a way similar to that for cash flow hedges.
In the IASB's view, this would best reflect the character of transaction costs (like those capitalised for inventory or property, plant and equipment).
BC6.394 In contrast, the IASB considered that for time-period related hedged items the nature of the time value of the option used as the hedging instrument is that of a cost for obtaining protection against a risk over a particular period of time.
The IASB noted that this would require accumulating the cumulative change in fair value of the option's time value in other comprehensive income and amortising the original time value by transferring in each period an amount to profit or loss.
The IASB considered that the amortisation pattern should be determined on a systematic and rational basis, which would best reflect principle-based standard-setting.
BC6.395 The IASB also considered situations in which the option used has critical terms (such as the nominal amount, the life and the underlying) that do not match the hedged item. This raises the following questions
The IASB noted that this would require an option pricing exercise using the terms of the hedged item as well as other relevant information about the hedged item (in particular, the volatility of its price or cash flow, which is a driver of an option's time value).
The IASB noted that if, at inception of the hedging relationship, the actual time value is higher than the aligned time value, the entity pays a higher premium than that which reflects the costs of hedging.
Hence, the IASB considered that the amount that is recognised in accumulated other comprehensive income should be determined only on the basis of the aligned time value, whereas the remainder of the actual time value should be accounted for as a derivative.
BC6.398 Conversely, the IASB noted that if, at inception of the hedging relationship, the actual time value is lower than the aligned time value, the entity actually pays a lower premium than it would have to pay to cover the risk fully.
The IASB considered that in this situation, in order to avoid accounting for a higher time value of an option than was actually paid, the amount that is recognised in accumulated other comprehensive income would have to be determined by reference to the lower of the cumulative fair value change of
BC6.399 The IASB also considered whether the balances accumulated in other comprehensive income would require an impairment test.
The IASB decided that because the accounting for the time value of the option was closely linked to hedge accounting, an impairment test that uses features of the hedge accounting model would be appropriate.
Hence, for transaction related hedged items the impairment test would be similar to that for the cash flow hedge reserve.
For time-period related hedged items the IASB considered that the part of the option's time value that remains in accumulated other comprehensive income should be immediately recognised in profit or loss when the hedging relationship is discontinued.
That would reflect that the reason for amortising the amount would no longer apply after the insured risk (ie the hedged item) no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
The IASB noted that impairment of the hedged item affects the criteria for qualifying hedges and if those are no longer met it would result in an impairment loss for the remaining unamortised balance of the time value of the option.
In their view, the proposals alleviated undue profit or loss volatility and reflected the economic substance of the transaction.
They also thought that the costs of hedging should be associated with the hedged item instead of being mischaracterised as hedge ineffectiveness.
the requirement to differentiate between transaction related and time-period related hedged items; and
the requirement to measure the fair value of the aligned time value.
Those concerns included the concern that the costs of implementing the proposals could outweigh the benefits, for instance, for less sophisticated (for example, smaller) entities.
BC6.402 Some respondents did not agree with the proposed accounting for transaction related hedged items. Some argued that time value should always be expensed over the option period.
BC6.403 In the light of this feedback the IASB considered in its redeliberations
whether it should remove the differentiation between transaction related and time-period related hedged items and replace it with a single accounting treatment; and
whether it should simplify the requirement to account for the fair value of the aligned time value.
The IASB noted that such an accounting treatment would have outcomes that would be inconsistent with the notion of the time value being regarded as costs of hedging.
This is because it could result in recognising an expense in periods that are unrelated to how the hedged exposure affects profit or loss.
However, the IASB noted that a single accounting treatment would be inconsistent with other Standards because it would not distinguish situations in a similar way (see paragraphs BC6.391–BC6.392).
Hence, the IASB considered that the suggested single accounting treatment would essentially treat unlike situations as alike.
The IASB noted that this would actually diminish comparability and hence not be an improvement to financial reporting.
As part of those discussions the IASB considered
applying the proposed accounting treatment for the time value of options to the entire amount of the time value paid even if it differs from the aligned time value.
This means that entities would not need to perform a separate valuation for the fair value of the aligned time value.
However, the IASB considered that only the time value that relates to the hedged item should be treated as a cost of hedging.
Hence, any additional time value paid should be accounted for as a derivative at fair value through profit or loss.
In the latter case, the amount recognised in profit or loss as a 'trading instrument' is the difference between the change in the fair value of the option in its entirety and the change in fair value of the intrinsic value.
This accounting treatment would not be consistent with the character of the changes in the time value that the IASB is seeking to portray, ie that of costs of hedging.
In addition, the IASB noted that providing a choice would reduce comparability between entities and it would make financial statements more difficult to understand.
They noted that time value was subject to 'time decay' and that both the purchased and the written option would lose their time value over time as the collar approaches expiry.
Accounting for the forward element of forward contracts
designating a forward contract as a hedging instrument in its entirety; or
separating the forward element and designating as the hedging instrument only the spot element.
BC6.416 The IASB noted that the characteristics of forward elements depended on the underlying item, for example
for interest rate risk, the forward element reflects the term structure of interest rates; and
for commodity risk, the forward element represents what is called the 'cost of carry' (for example, it includes costs such as storage costs).
In contrast to many typical situations in which options were used to hedge transactions that did not involve a time value notion because they were not options (see paragraph BC6.388), in situations in which forward contracts were used the value of hedged items typically did have a forward element that corresponded to that of the hedge.
The IASB noted that this meant that an entity could choose to designate the forward contract in its entirety and use the 'forward rate method' to measure the hedged item.
An entity can then recognise the forward element as costs of hedging by using the forward rate method, resulting in, for example
capitalising the forward element into the cost of the acquired asset or liability assumed; or
reclassifying the forward element into profit or loss when the hedged item (for example, hedged sales denominated in a foreign currency) affects profit or loss.
Hence, the IASB considered that, for situations similar to hedges of transaction related hedged items using options, applying the forward rate method would, in effect, achieve an accounting outcome that treated the forward element like costs of hedging.
use the forward rate method (ie forward elements are capitalised into the cost of inventory, instead of being accounted for as at fair value through profit or loss over the time of the hedge); or
Neither of the above accounting outcomes are aligned with the treatment for the time value of options for time-period related hedged items that requires that the time value is amortised on a systematic and rational basis.
BC6.422 The IASB also noted that the accounting for monetary financial assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency had an important consequence.
BC6.423 Consequently, the IASB acknowledged that aligning the accounting for forward elements with the accounting for the time value of options was a particular concern to entities that, for example, had more funding in their functional currency than they could invest in financial assets in their functional currency.
To generate an economic return on their surplus funds, such entities exchange those funds into a foreign currency and invest in assets denominated in that foreign currency.
To manage their exposure to foreign exchange risk (and to stabilise their net interest margin), such entities commonly enter into foreign exchange derivatives.
Such transactions usually involve the following simultaneously
swapping the functional currency surplus funds into a foreign currency;
investing the funds in a foreign currency financial asset for a period of time; and
entering into a foreign exchange derivative to convert the foreign currency funds back into the functional currency at the end of the investment period.
This amount typically covers the principal plus the interest at maturity.
The net economic return (ie the interest margin) over the investment period is determined by adjusting the yield of the investment in the foreign currency by the forward points (ie the forward element of the foreign exchange derivative) and then deducting the interest expense.
They believed that, as in the case of the accounting for the time value of options, it gave rise to a similar need for adjusting profit or loss against other comprehensive income to represent the cost of achieving a fixed economic return in a way that is consistent with the accounting for that return.
BC6.426 In the light of the arguments raised by respondents, the IASB decided to permit forward points that exist at inception of the hedging relationship to be recognised in profit or loss over time on a systematic and rational basis and to accumulate subsequent fair value changes through other comprehensive income.
The IASB considered that this accounting treatment would provide a better representation of the economic substance of the transaction and the performance of the net interest margin.
For example, hedged items that together constitute an overall net position of assets and liabilities could not be designated into a hedging relationship with that net position as the hedged item.
Other groups were eligible if the individual items within that group had similar risk characteristics and shared the risk exposure that was designated as being hedged.
Furthermore, the change in the fair value attributable to the hedged risk for each individual item in the group had to be approximately proportional to the overall change in the fair value of the group for the hedged risk.
The effect of those restrictions was that a group would generally qualify as a hedged item only if all the items in that group would qualify for hedge accounting for the same hedged risk on an individual basis (ie each as an individual hedged item).
groups of items that form a gross position; or
groups of (partially) offsetting items or risks that result in a net position.
The group hedging approach views the risk at a higher aggregated level.
Such an entity could not designate the net position of sales and expenses as the hedged item.
Instead, if it wanted to apply hedge accounting it had to designate a gross position that best matched its hedging instrument.
However, the IASB noted there were a number of reasons why this could render information less useful, for example
BC6.434 The following subsections set out the IASB's considerations about the application of hedge accounting in the context of groups of items.
Criteria for the eligibility of a group of items as a hedged item
BC6.435 An individual hedge approach involves an entity entering into one or more hedging instruments to manage a risk exposure from an individual hedged item to achieve a desired outcome. This is similar for a group hedge approach.
However, for a group hedge approach an entity seeks to manage the risk exposure from a group of items.
Some of the risks in the group may offset (for their full term or for a partial term) and provide a hedge against each other, leaving the group residual risk to be hedged by the hedging instrument.
Consequently, the IASB proposed that the eligibility criteria that apply to individual hedged items should also apply to hedges of groups of items.
However, some restrictions were retained for cash flow hedges of net positions.
Designation of a layer component of a nominal amount for hedges of a group of items
The IASB also considered whether it would be appropriate to extend that decision on single items to groups of items and hence allow the designation of a layer of a group in a hedging relationship.
In addition, the IASB also noted other reasons that support the use of components for groups of items
uncertainties such as a breach (or cancellation) of contracts, or prepayment, can be better modelled when considering a group of items;
in practice, hedging layers of groups of items (for example, a bottom layer) is a common risk management strategy; and
arbitrarily identifying and designating (as hedged items) specific items from a group of items that are exposed to the same hedged risk can
give rise to arbitrary accounting results if the designated items do not behave as originally expected (while other items, sufficient to cover the hedged amount, do behave as originally expected); and
can provide opportunities for earnings management (for example, by choosing to transfer and derecognise particular items from a group of homogeneous items when only some were specifically designated into a fair value hedge and therefore have fair value hedge adjustments attached to them).
Given the different types of groups that could exist in practice, in some cases it could be easy to satisfy the proposed conditions and in some cases it could be more challenging or even impossible.
The IASB considered that it is not appropriate to define the cases in which the proposed conditions were satisfied because it would depend on the specific facts and circumstances.
The IASB therefore considered a criteria-based approach would be more operational and appropriate.
Such an approach would allow hedge accounting to be applied in situations in which the criteria are easy to meet as well as in cases in which, although the criteria are more challenging to meet, an entity is prepared to undertake the necessary efforts (for example, to invest in systems in order to achieve compliance with the hedge accounting requirements).
Cash flow hedges of a group of items that constitutes a net position that qualifies for hedge accounting
For hedges of net positions, items in the group have some offsetting risk positions that provide a natural hedge for some of the risks in the group (ie the gains on some items offset the losses on others).
Hence, for a cash flow hedge of a net position that is a group of forecast transactions, the cumulative change in value (from the inception of the hedge) that arises on some forecast transactions (to the extent that it is effective in achieving offset) must be deferred in other comprehensive income.
This is necessary because the gain or loss that arises on the forecast transactions that occur in the early phase of the hedging relationship must be reclassified to profit or loss in the later phase until the last hedged item in the net position affects profit or loss.
BC6.443 The forecast transactions that constitute a hedged net position might differ in their timing such that they affect profit or loss in different reporting periods.
For example, sales and unrelated expenditure hedged for foreign currency risk might affect profit or loss in different reporting periods.
When this happens, the cumulative change in value of the designated sales (to be reclassified later when the expenditure is recognised as an expense) needs to be excluded from profit or loss and instead be deferred in other comprehensive income.
This is required in order to ensure that the effect of the sales on profit or loss is based on the hedged exchange rate.
When those other transactions occurred, their measurement would be adjusted for the amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income on forecast transactions that had occurred earlier.
BC6.445 The IASB acknowledged that this approach would not result in the recognition of gains and losses on items that do not yet exist but would instead defer gains and losses on some forecast transactions as those transactions occurred.
that occurred in the early phases of the hedging relationship, ie those for which gains and losses were deferred when the transaction occurred; and
those that occurred in the later phases of the hedging relationship and were adjusted for the gains or losses that had been deferred on the forecast transactions as those transactions had occurred in the early phases of the hedging relationship.
BC6.446 The IASB noted that the accounting for the forecast transactions that occurred in the later phases of the hedging relationship was comparable to that of forecast transactions that were hedged items in a cash flow hedge.
However, the treatment of the forecast transactions that occurred in the early phases of the hedging relationship would be more similar to that of a hedging instrument than to that of a hedged item.
The IASB concluded that this would be a significant departure from general IFRS requirements and the requirements of the hedge accounting model for hedging instruments.
The IASB noted that when the offsetting risk positions affected profit or loss in the same period those concerns would not apply in the same way as no deferral in accumulated other comprehensive income of cumulative gains and losses on forecast transactions would be required.
Hence, the IASB proposed that such net positions should be eligible as hedged items.
They believed that without this restriction the potential for earnings management would arise.
Despite agreeing with the proposals, some respondents asked the IASB to provide additional guidance on the treatment of the amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income if, in a cash flow hedge of a net position, the offsetting risk positions that were initially expected to affect profit or loss in the same reporting period subsequently changed and, as a result, were expected to affect profit or loss in different periods.
BC6.449 Others requested the IASB to reconsider the restriction on the application of hedge accounting to cash flow hedges of a net position with offsetting risk positions that affect profit or loss in different reporting periods.
Those respondents believed that this restriction would not allow entities to properly reflect their risk management activities.
The respondents who provided comments from this perspective typically look at cash inflows and cash outflows arising from both sides of the net position.
The treasury view stops at the level of the cash flows and does not take into account the time lag that might exist between the cash flow and the recognition of related income or expense in profit or loss.
This goes beyond the cash flow view of the treasury perspective.
This is because the way in which the item affects profit or loss can be different, while the cash flow is a point-in-time event.
Similarly, if inventory is sold in the period after it was purchased, the cash flow and the related effect on profit or loss occur in different periods.
BC6.452 The IASB noted that entities would only be able to reflect their risk management activities if it removed the restriction on the application of hedge accounting to cash flow hedges of a net position with offsetting risk positions that affect profit or loss in different reporting periods.
However, the IASB noted that it could address the concerns about earnings management by introducing some requirements for documenting the hedging relationship instead of prohibiting the designation altogether.
BC6.453 The IASB noted that the potential for earnings management could be addressed if the recognition pattern for profit or loss arising from the hedged net position for all reporting periods affected was set at the inception of the hedge, in such a way that it was clear what amounts would affect profit or loss, when they would affect profit or loss and to which hedged volumes and types of items they related.
The IASB noted that foreign currency risk was the risk most commented on by respondents and the risk that the IASB intended to address by this type of hedge.
BC6.455 Consequently, the IASB decided that cash flow hedges of net positions would only be available for hedges of foreign currency risk (but no other risks).
In addition, the IASB decided to remove the restriction that the offsetting risk positions in a net position must affect profit or loss in the same reporting period.
However, the IASB was concerned that without sufficiently specific documentation of the items within the designated net position, an entity could use hindsight to allocate the hedging gains or losses to those items so as to achieve a particular result in profit or loss (selection effect).
Consequently, the IASB decided that for all items within the designated net position for which there could be a selection effect, an entity must specify each period in which the transactions are expected to affect profit or loss as well as the nature and volume of each type of forecast transaction in such a way that it eliminates the selection effect.
For example, depending on the circumstances, eliminating a selection effect could require that specifying the nature of a forecast purchase of items of property, plant and equipment includes aspects such as the depreciation pattern for items of the same kind, if the nature of those items is such that the depreciation pattern could vary depending on how the entity uses those items (such as different useful lives because of being used in different production processes).
The IASB noted that this would also address the issue that some respondents had raised about changes in the original expectations of when the risk positions would affect profit or loss resulting in items affecting profit or loss in different reporting periods (see paragraph BC6.449).
Presentation for groups of items that are a net position
Consequently, this raises the question of how hedging gains or losses should be presented for a cash flow hedge of such a group.
BC6.457 The IASB noted that if it proposed to adjust (gross up) all the affected line items in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income it would result in the recognition of gross (partially offsetting) gains or losses that did not exist, and that this would not be consistent with general accounting principles.
However, the IASB acknowledged that this results in additional disaggregation of information in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
This would also result in hedges of net positions being presented differently from hedges of gross positions.
Because the treatment of gains or losses for both the hedged item and the hedging instrument is the same, the IASB did not believe any changes to the fair value hedge accounting mechanics were necessary to accommodate net positions.
However, in situations in which some hedging gains or losses are considered a modification of revenue or an expense (for example, when the net interest accrual on an interest rate swap is considered a modification of the interest revenue or expense on the hedged item), those gains or losses should be presented in a separate line when the hedged item is a net position.
In the IASB's view, in those situations the same reasons applied that it had considered for cash flow hedges in relation to their presentation in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Identifying the hedged item for hedges of a group of items that constitutes a net position
The IASB concluded that an entity would need to designate a combination of gross positions if it were to apply the hedge accounting mechanics to the hedged position.
Consequently, the IASB proposed that an entity could not designate a merely abstract net position (ie without specifying the items that form the gross positions from which the net position arises) as the hedged item.
Hedges of a group of items that results in a net position of nil
For an entity that hedges on such a basis, the IASB acknowledged that there might be circumstances in which, by coincidence, the net position of hedged items for a particular period was nil.
Such a hedging relationship could be, in its entirety, outside the scope of hedge accounting if it did not include any financial instruments.
Furthermore, eligibility for hedge accounting would be inconsistent with the general requirement that a hedging relationship must contain both an eligible hedged item and an eligible hedging instrument.
in periods in which hedge accounting is permitted (because a net position exists and is hedged with a hedging instrument), the transactions would affect profit or loss at an overall hedged rate or price; whereas
in periods in which hedge accounting would not be permitted (because the net position is nil), transactions would affect profit or loss at prevailing spot rates or prices.
However, the IASB noted that such situations would be coincidental and hence it expected that nil net positions would be rare in practice.
BC6.469 Many financial institutions use credit derivatives to manage their credit risk exposures arising from their lending activities.
This might also reduce the regulatory capital requirement for the loan or loan commitment while at the same time allowing the financial institution to retain nominal ownership of the loan and to preserve the relationship with the client.
Credit portfolio managers frequently use credit derivatives to hedge the credit risk of a proportion of a particular exposure (for example, a facility for a particular client) or the bank's overall lending portfolio.
BC6.470 However, the credit risk of a financial item is not a risk component that meets the eligibility criteria for hedged items.
The spread between the risk-free rate and the market interest rate incorporates credit risk, liquidity risk, funding risk and any other unidentified risk component and margin elements.
Although it is possible to determine that the spread includes credit risk, the credit risk cannot be isolated in a way that would allow the change in fair value that is attributable solely to credit risk to be separately identifiable (see also paragraph BC6.503).
However, the fair value option is only available at initial recognition, is irrevocable and an entity must designate the financial item in its entirety (ie for its full nominal amount).
Because of the various optional features and the drawdown behavioural pattern of the loans and loan commitments, credit portfolio managers often engage in a flexible and active risk management strategy.
Consequently, most financial institutions do not (and often cannot) elect to apply the fair value option because of the associated restrictions and scope.
BC6.472 As a result, financial institutions that use credit default swaps to hedge the credit risk of their loan portfolios measure their loan portfolios at amortised cost and do not recognise most loan commitments (ie those that meet the scope exception of IFRS 9).
The changes in fair value of the credit default swaps are recognised in profit or loss in every reporting period (as for a trading book).
The accounting outcome is an accounting mismatch of gains and losses of the loans and loan commitments versus those of the credit default swaps, which creates volatility in profit or loss.
During the IASB's outreach programme, many users of financial statements pointed out that that outcome does not reflect the economic substance of the credit risk management strategy of financial institutions.
As mentioned before, measuring the credit risk component of a loan or a loan commitment is complex.
Consequently, to accommodate an equivalent to hedge accounting when entities hedge credit risk, a different accounting requirement would have to be developed specifically for this type of risk, or the proposed hedge accounting requirements would have to be significantly modified (for example, in relation to eligible hedged items and effectiveness testing).
Those alternatives would, subject to qualification criteria, permit an entity with regard to the hedged credit exposure (for example, a bond, loan or loan commitment)
to elect fair value through profit or loss only at initial recognition;
to designate a component of nominal amounts; and
(iii) to discontinue fair value through profit or loss accounting.
to elect fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition or subsequently (if subsequently, the difference between the then carrying amount and the then fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss);
to elect fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition or subsequently (if subsequently, the difference between the then carrying amount and the then fair value is amortised or deferred);
This would also apply to financial instruments that fall outside the scope of IFRS 9, for example, loan commitments.
Instead of the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting (see paragraphs BC6.230–BC6.271), the IASB considered the following qualifying criteria for electing fair value through profit or loss
the name of the credit exposure matches the reference entity of the credit derivative (name matching); and
the seniority of the financial instrument matches that of the instruments that can be delivered in accordance with the credit derivative.
BC6.476 The qualification criteria in BC6.475 are set with a view to accommodating economic hedges of credit risk that would otherwise qualify for hedge accounting, but for the fact that the credit risk component within the hedged exposure cannot be separately identified and hence is not a risk component that meets the eligibility criteria for hedged items.
Those qualification criteria are also consistent with regulatory requirements and the risk management strategy underlying the current business practice of financial institutions.
However, using name matching as a qualifying criterion means that index-based credit default swaps would not meet that criterion.
BC6.477 For discontinuation, the IASB considered the following criteria
the qualifying criteria are no longer met; and
retaining the measurement at fair value through profit or loss is not needed because of any other requirements.
BC6.478 Given the rationale for electing fair value through profit or loss, an entity would typically discontinue accounting at fair value through profit or loss if the discontinuation criteria in BC6.477 are met, because that would ensure that the accounting is aligned with how the exposure is managed (ie the credit risk is no longer managed using credit derivatives).
Hence, the IASB considered that it would be logical to make the discontinuation of fair value through profit or loss accounting mandatory (instead of optional) if the discontinuation criteria are fulfilled.
Fair value through profit or loss can be discontinued if the qualification criteria are met.
By not permitting the election of fair value through profit or loss after initial recognition (or inception of a loan commitment), the difference at later points in time between the carrying amount and the fair value of the financial instrument will not arise.
This means that the election is available again for an exposure for which fair value through profit or loss was elected previously (which logically cannot apply if the election is restricted to initial recognition).
This ensures that an entity that uses a credit risk management strategy that protects exposures that drop below a certain quality or risk level could align the accounting with their risk management.
BC6.482 The IASB noted that when the financial instrument is elected for measurement as at fair value through profit or loss after initial recognition, a difference could arise between its carrying amount and its fair value.
This difference is a result of the change in the measurement basis (for example, from amortised cost to fair value for a loan).
The IASB considers this type of difference a measurement change adjustment.
At the date of discontinuation of fair value through profit or loss accounting, the fair value will be the deemed cost (as in Alternative 1).
If the financial instrument is elected again after a previous discontinuation, the measurement change adjustment at that date is also recognised immediately in profit or loss.
It is reflective of how credit exposures are managed.
Credit exposures are actively managed by credit risk portfolio managers.
Furthermore, it might appear susceptible to earnings management.
An entity can decide at what time to elect fair value through profit or loss accounting for the financial instrument and thus when the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value at that date would be recognised in profit or loss.
The accounting impact of immediately recognising the measurement change adjustment in profit or loss may also deter an entity from electing fair value through profit or loss accounting.
For example, when an entity decides to take out credit protection at a time when the fair value has already moved below the carrying amount of the loan because of credit concerns in the market, it will immediately recognise a loss if it elects fair value through profit or loss accounting.
Consequently, it also allows financial institutions to achieve an accounting outcome that reflects their credit risk management strategy.
It allows the effects of an active and flexible risk management approach to be reflected appropriately and significantly reduces the measurement inconsistency between the credit exposures and the credit derivatives.
The measurement change adjustment could be presented in the statement of financial position in the following ways
as an integral part of the carrying amount of the exposure (ie it could be added to the fair value of the loan): this results in a mixed amount that is neither fair value nor amortised cost;
BC6.489 The IASB noted that disclosures could make the measurement change adjustment transparent.
Respondents commented that hedges of credit risk using credit derivatives are becoming an increasingly significant practice issue in the application of IFRS.
They also noted that financial reporting under IFRS should allow entities to reflect the effects of such activities in the financial statements consistently with the overall hedge accounting objective to better reflect risk management activities.
They noted that, because of the accounting mismatch between loans and loan commitments on the one hand and the related credit derivatives on the other hand, the profit or loss under IFRS is significantly more volatile for financial institutions that hedge their credit risk exposures than for financial institutions that do not hedge.
BC6.493 Many respondents noted that the objective of hedge accounting would not be met if IFRS would not provide a way to account for hedges of credit risk so that financial statements can reflect the credit risk management activities of financial institutions.
BC6.494 Most users of financial statements commented that the IASB should address this issue.
Many also noted that the financial statements currently reflect accounting-driven volatility when credit risk is hedged and that those financial statements do not align with those risk management activities.
BC6.495 Participants in the outreach provided the same feedback.
Most of them were also of the view that this is an important practice issue that the IASB should address.
BC6.496 However, the feedback was mixed on how the IASB should address or resolve this issue.
Many respondents were of the view that it was difficult to reliably measure credit risk as a risk component for the purposes of hedge accounting.
Some users of financial statements supported elective fair value through profit or loss accounting because they thought that the benefits of providing a better depiction of the economics of the risk management activities would outweigh the complexity.
In its redeliberations the IASB explored various accounting alternatives.
Treating credit risk as a risk component
Whether an event constitutes a credit event is determined by a committee consisting of representatives of banks and fund entities.
This can (and in practice did) result in situations in which the fair value of a debt instrument has decreased, reflecting the market view of credit losses on those debt instruments while any payout on credit default swaps for those debt instruments depends on how the difficulties of the debtor will be resolved and what related measures might be considered a credit event.
This is a factor that affects credit default swaps in a different way than the actual underlying debt.
It is an additional factor inherent in credit default swaps that is not inherent in the debt as such.
Hence, there could be scenarios in which, for example, an impairment loss on a loan might not be compensated by a payout from a credit default swap that is linked to the obligor of that debt.
Also, market liquidity and the behaviour of speculators trying to close positions and taking gains affect the credit default swap and the debt market in different ways.
BC6.502 The IASB also noted that when a financial institution enters into a credit default swap to hedge the credit exposure from a loan commitment it might result in a situation in which the reference entity defaults while the loan commitment remains undrawn or partly undrawn.
In such situations the financial institution receives compensation from the payout on the credit default swaps without actually incurring a credit loss.
Hence, the compensation received for credit risk depends on the fair value of the reference instrument.
The IASB noted that, for a fixed-rate loan, the fair value of the reference instrument is also affected by changes in market interest rates.
In other words, on settlement of the credit default swap, the entity also settles the fair value changes attributable to interest rate risk — and not solely fair value changes attributable to the credit risk of the reference entity.
BC6.504 Hence, the IASB considered that credit risk is not a separately identifiable risk component and thus does not qualify for designation as a hedged item on a risk component basis.
Exception to the general risk component criteria
Respondents to that Exposure Draft, like the IASB, acknowledged that the default method was imprecise but considered the result a reasonable proxy in many cases.
Those respondents said that it was often very difficult or impossible to separate those items.
That method requires entities to deduct any changes in market conditions from changes in the fair value of the instrument.
Any residual amount is deemed to be attributable to changes in credit.
The IASB noted that the loans and loan commitments for which the credit risk is hedged very often have no observable market price and that, in order to achieve a close approximation of the credit risk, complex modelling would be involved to arrive at a 'market price'.
This would also be complex when trying to achieve a close approximation of the credit risk.
Hence, in order to achieve a close approximation of the credit risk, isolating the changes for market conditions on those embedded options could involve significant judgement and could become extremely complex.
Hence, the IASB had actively sought to limit the application of this approach by retaining the bifurcation requirement for hybrid financial liabilities, even though bifurcation of financial assets was eliminated.
BC6.513 The IASB acknowledged that in order to ensure that hedge ineffectiveness is recognised the qualifying criteria for risk components use a higher degree of precision than a mere proxy.
Also, for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities the IASB sought to minimise the application of this proxy by retaining the separation of embedded derivatives.
BC6.514 The IASB also considered whether it should permit 'residual risks' as an eligible hedged item.
BC6.515 The IASB noted that that approach would have the advantage of not requiring an entity to directly measure credit risk.
Hence, determining the part of the fair value changes that is attributable to a specific risk (for example, interest rate risk) could be complex.
Applying financial guarantee contract accounting
However, it is not a precondition for entering into a credit default swap that the holder is exposed to the underlying reference financial instrument (ie an entity can hold a 'naked' position).
BC6.520 The IASB noted that it would have to broaden the definition of 'financial guarantee contract' in order to include such credit derivatives.
The IASB also noted that accounting for credit default swaps as financial guarantee contracts would mean that credit default swaps would not be measured at fair value but at 'cost', ie it would result in applying accrual accounting to a derivative financial instrument.
This is because the premium for a credit default swap, or at least a large part of the premium, is paid over time — but only until a credit event occurs.
The IASB noted that in order to apply the same accounting as for the time value of options, the contingent nature of the credit default swap premium would have to be ignored so that the amortisation of the premium to profit or loss could be based on the assumption that no credit event occurs — even though that risk is reflected in the fair value of the credit default swap.
The IASB also noted that in substance this would be 'as-you-go' accounting for the credit default swap premium (ie recognising it in profit or loss on an accrual basis).
This raises the question of whether the credit default swap would only have time value (and hence no intrinsic value) until a credit event occurs, ie whether before a credit event occurs the entire fair value of the credit default swap should be deemed to be its time value.
BC6.525 The IASB considered that it would be inappropriate to simply attribute the entire fair value of the credit default swap before a credit event to time value.
The IASB noted that hedged items such as bonds or loans have 'intrinsic' value but not an equivalent to time value.
In an effective economic hedge, the changes in the intrinsic value in the hedged item would offset the changes in the intrinsic value of the hedging instrument.
During times of financial difficulty, but before a credit event (for example, before an actual default), the fair value of the loan would have decreased because of credit deterioration.
Also, the fair value of the related credit default swap would increase because of the higher risk of default.
Hence, the IASB considered that the increase in fair value of the credit default swap includes some intrinsic value element even though it would be difficult to isolate and separately quantify it.
BC6.526 The IASB also noted that if the entire fair value on a credit default swap was treated as time value before default, there could be an accounting mismatch when an entity recognised an impairment loss on the loan or loan commitment before default.
This is because all fair value changes from the credit default swap would still be recognised in other comprehensive income.
The IASB considered that this would give rise to the same problems as other approximations it had discussed when it rejected an exception to the general risk component criteria, namely that any mismatch of economic gains or losses from the hedge would not be recognised as hedge ineffectiveness.
Instead, under this approach profit or loss recognition for the credit default swap would be the same as accrual accounting while assuming perfect hedge effectiveness.
They argued that such an approach would best address the accounting mismatch between loans or loan commitments and credit derivatives and would reflect the risk management of financial institutions.
any premium paid at the inception of the credit default swap (or its fair value if an existing contract is used) would be amortised over the life of that contract;
the periodic premium would be expensed as paid each period (including adjustments for premium accruals);
the fair value of the credit default swap would be disclosed in the notes; and
in the assessment of impairment, the cash flow that might result from the credit default swap in case of a credit event is treated in the same way as cash flows that might result from the collateral or guarantee of a collateralised or guaranteed financial asset.
In other words, the loan or loan commitment for which credit risk is managed using the credit default swap is treated like a collateralised or guaranteed financial asset with the credit default swap accounted for like collateral or a guarantee.
However, the aligned credit default swap would only address maturity mismatches.
It would not capture other differences between the actual credit default swap and the hedged credit exposure (for example, that a loan might be prepayable) because the insurance approach only intends to change the accounting for the credit default swap instead of adjusting the credit exposure for value changes that reflect all of its characteristics.
BC6.531 The IASB considered that the insurance approach would have a simple interaction with an impairment model as a result of treating the credit default swap like collateral or a guarantee, which means it would affect the estimate of the recoverable cash flows.
Hence, this interaction would be at the most basic level of the information that any impairment model uses so that the effect would not differ by type of impairment model (assuming only credit derivatives with a remaining life equal to, or longer than, the remaining exposure period would qualify for the insurance approach).
BC6.532 However, the IASB noted that difficulties would arise when the insurance approach was discontinued before the credit exposure matures.
Hence, any mismatch of economic gains or losses (ie economic hedge ineffectiveness) between loans or loan commitments and the credit derivatives would not be recognised in profit or loss.
In addition, it would result in omitting the fair value of the credit default swap from the statement of financial position even though fair value provides important and relevant information about derivative financial instruments.
BC6.534 The IASB therefore rejected this alternative.
Applying a 'deemed credit adjustment approach
BC6.535 The IASB also considered an approach that would adjust the carrying amount of the hedged credit exposure against profit or loss.
The adjustment would be the change in the fair value of a credit default swap that matches the maturity of the hedged credit exposure ('aligned' credit default swap value).
The mechanics of this would be similar to how, in a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to a risk component adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in profit or loss.
Essentially, the cumulative change in the fair value of the aligned credit default swap would be deemed to be the credit risk component of the exposure in a fair value hedge of credit risk (ie act as a proxy for credit risk — 'deemed credit adjustment').
When the deemed credit adjustment approach is discontinued before the credit exposure matures an accounting treatment that is similar to that used for discontinued fair value hedges could be used.
BC6.537 However, the IASB was concerned that the interaction between the deemed credit adjustment approach and impairment accounting would be significantly more complex than under the insurance approach because the deemed credit adjustment and the impairment allowance would be 'competing mechanisms' in the accounting for impairment losses.
This would also involve the danger of double counting for credit losses.
The interaction would depend on the type of impairment model and would be more difficult in conjunction with an expected loss model.
Allowing entities to elect fair value accounting for the hedged credit exposure
As a consequence, to ensure that the measurement change adjustment is not inappropriately deferred but recognised immediately in profit or loss when impaired, the measurement change adjustment would require an impairment test.
This would result in interaction with the impairment model.
It results in the recognition of gains on credit default swaps while the impairment is recognised on a different measurement basis and with a time lag because of the impairment models.
Hence, in a situation in which the situation of a lender deteriorates but it has protected itself, gains are shown even though the protection keeps the situation neutral at best.
This would best capture all economic mismatches but would come at the expense of inevitably including in the remeasurement interest rate risk in addition to credit risk.
However, the IASB also noted that some would consider that outcome as relevant because it would signal a different approach to managing credit risk and this difference would often be a loss that is a reflection of any lag in the impairment model behind the 'market view'.
This would require the entity to assume that a loan had been drawn under the loan commitment in order to determine an amortisation profile.
The rationale for this alternative is that a credit loss only results from a loan commitment if that loan commitment gets drawn and the resulting loan is not repaid.
It would avoid the need to capitalise any remaining carrying amount into individual drawings to ensure its amortisation, which would be operationally complex.
The IASB understands that a significant number of IFRS preparers—financial institutions in particular—have made such an accounting policy choice.
These respondents asked the IASB to clarify whether the scope of the exceptions was meant to include such hedging relationships.
The IASB agreed with respondents that other hedging relationships could be directly affected by the reform when the reform gives rise to uncertainties about the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or of the hedging instrument.
Therefore, the IASB confirmed that the exceptions would apply to the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows in these situations.
The IASB noted that many derivatives, designated in hedging relationships in which there is no uncertainty about the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows, could be indirectly affected by the reform.
The IASB confirmed that the exceptions do not apply to these hedging relationships, despite the indirect effect the uncertainties arising from the reform could have on the valuation of derivatives.
This requirement is intended to ensure that changes in the fair value of designated hedging instruments are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve only for those hedged forecast transactions that are highly probable to occur.
As set out in paragraph BC6.550, in the IASB's view, discontinuing all affected hedging relationships solely due to such uncertainty would not provide useful information to users of financial statements.
In the example described in paragraph BC6.559, the entity assumed that the interest rate benchmark in the future contract would not be altered as a result of the reform when determining whether that forecast transaction is highly probable.
BC6.561 The IASB also included an exception for discontinued hedging relationships.
If, however, the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur for other reasons, the entity is required to immediately reclassify to profit or loss any amount remaining in the cash flow hedge reserve.
Assessment of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument
BC6.562 Applying IFRS 9, a hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting only if there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.
BC6.563 Demonstrating the existence of an economic relationship requires the estimation of future cash flows because the assessment is prospective in nature.
That is because entities would have to consider possible changes to the fair value or future cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments to assess whether an economic relationship continues to exist between the hedged item and hedging instrument.
Consequently, at some point in time, it is possible that entities would not be able to demonstrate the existence of an economic relationship solely because of uncertainties arising from the reform.
BC6.567 The IASB noted that the exceptions were not intended to change the requirement that entities measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness.
The IASB considered that the actual results of the hedging relationships would provide useful information to users of financial statements during the period of uncertainty arising from the reform.
Therefore, the IASB decided that entities should continue to measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness as required by IFRS Standards.
BC6.568 The IASB also considered whether any exceptions should be made to the measurement of hedged items or hedging instruments because of the uncertainty arising from the reform.
However, the IASB noted that such an exception would be inconsistent with the decision not to change the requirements to measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness in the financial statements.
Therefore, the IASB decided not to provide an exception from the measurement of hedging instruments and hedged items.
As the IASB decided that entities should continue to measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness as required by IFRS Standards, entities should continue to apply assumptions that are consistent with those applied to the hedged risk of the hedged item.
The IASB concluded that reflecting market participants' assumptions when measuring hedge ineffectiveness provides useful information to users of financial statements about the effects of the uncertainty arising from the reform on an entity's hedging relationships.
Therefore, the IASB decided that no exceptions are needed for the measurement of actual ineffectiveness.
For example, if the outcome of the reform affects the market structure of an interest rate benchmark, it could affect an entity's assessment of whether a non-contractually specified LIBOR component is separately identifiable and, therefore, an eligible hedged item in a hedging relationship.
The IASB considered only risk components that are implicit in the fair value or the cash flows of an item of which they are a part (referred to as non-contractually specified) because the same issue does not arise for risk components that are explicitly specified in the contract.
BC6.573 For the reasons outlined in paragraph BC6.550, the IASB noted that discontinuing hedging relationships due to uncertainty arising from the reform would not provide useful information.
BC6.574 The IASB proposed not to extend the relief to allow entities to designate the benchmark component of interest rate risk as the hedged item in a new hedging relationship if the risk component is not separately identifiable at the inception of the hedging relationship.
In the IASB's view, allowing hedge accounting for risk components that are not separately identifiable at the inception would be inconsistent with the objective of the exception.
The IASB noted that such circumstances are different from allowing continued designation as the hedged item for risk components that had met the requirement at the inception of the hedging relationship.
For the same reasons as those noted in paragraph BC6.572, this could affect an entity's ability to conclude that a non-contractually specified risk component remains separately identifiable and, therefore, an eligible hedged item for hedge accounting purposes.
Applying that paragraph, an entity shall determine whether the risk component is separately identifiable only when it initially designates an item as a hedged item in the hedging relationship.
At the inception of the relationship, the entity assesses whether LIBOR is a separately identifiable risk component for all loans designated within the hedging relationship.
BC6.581 The IASB considered but rejected alternatives that would have allowed entities to apply the exceptions voluntarily.
In the IASB's view, voluntary application of these exceptions could give rise to selective discontinuation of hedge accounting and selective reclassification of the amounts recorded in other comprehensive income related to previously discontinued hedging relationships.
The IASB does not expect that requiring entities to apply the exceptions would entail significant cost for preparers and other affected parties because the exceptions require entities to assume that the interest rate benchmark, on which the hedged risk and the hedged cash flows, and cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, is not altered as a result of the reform.
BC6.583 Furthermore, for a particular hedging relationship the exceptions may be applicable to some but not all aspects of the hedging relationship.
Similarly, the exception applicable to non-contractually specified components would not be relevant for hedging relationships that do not involve the designation of non-contractually specified risk components.
The IASB noted that, in some cases, a contract may be amended to include reference to the alternative benchmark rate without actually altering the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows in the contract.
The IASB considered the following scenarios to assess the robustness of the end of application requirements.
Uncertainty regarding both the timing and the amount of cash flows for this contract will be present until the central authority specifies when the replacement of the benchmark will become effective, and what the alternative benchmark rate and any related spread adjustment will be.
BC6.591 Scenario D—a contract is amended to include a clause in anticipation of the reform that specifies the date the interest rate benchmark will be replaced and any spread adjustment between the interest rate benchmark and the alternative benchmark rate will be determined.
However, the amendment does not specify the alternative benchmark rate, or the spread adjustment between the interest rate benchmark and the alternative benchmark rate, on which the cash flows will be based.
BC6.593 Scenario F—in preparation for the reform, a central authority in its capacity as the administrator of an interest rate benchmark undertakes a multi-step process to replace an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate.
BC6.594 For reasons similar to those described in paragraph BC6.583, the IASB noted that there could be situations in which the uncertainty for particular elements of a single hedging relationship could end at different times.
BC6.595 The IASB observed that continuing to apply the exception after the uncertainty was resolved would not faithfully represent the actual characteristics of the elements of the hedging relationship in which the uncertainty arising from the reform is eliminated.
The IASB considered whether it should extend the relief provided such that the exceptions would apply at the hedging relationship level for as long as any element of that hedging relationship was affected by the uncertainties arising from the reform.
The IASB agreed that doing so would be beyond the objective of addressing only those issues directly affected by the uncertainty arising from the reform.
Consequently, the IASB concluded that entities should be able to identify when the uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount of the resulting cash flows of a forecast transaction is no longer present.
If the IASB included an end date for these exceptions, an entity may be required to immediately discontinue hedge accounting because, at some point, as the reform progresses, the component based on the interest rate benchmark may no longer be separately identifiable (for example, as the market for the alternative benchmark rate is established).
The IASB noted that linking the end of application for these exceptions to contract amendments would not achieve the IASB's intention either because, by definition, non-contractually specified risk components are not explicitly stated in a contract and, therefore, these contracts may not be amended for the reform.
Consequently, the IASB amended the transition paragraph to specify that retrospective application applies only to those hedging relationships that existed at the beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies those requirements or were designated thereafter, and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve that existed at the beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies those requirements.
Accordingly, the IASB did not provide specific transition provisions for those entities.
BC6.607 The IASB observed that amending the formal designation of a hedging relationship to reflect the changes required by the reform would result in the discontinuation of the hedging relationship.
In all other circumstances, amendments to the hedge designation as documented at inception of the hedging relationship, result in the discontinuation of hedge accounting.
BC6.611 However, notwithstanding their general agreement with the proposed amendments, some respondents asked the IASB to clarify the scope and timing of the required changes to the affected hedging relationships.
In considering the timing of when entities are required to amend an affected hedging relationship, the IASB sought to balance the operational effort needed to amend the hedging relationships with maintaining the required discipline in the amendments to hedging relationships.
In this context, the IASB noted that if these other approaches result in derivatives with substantially different terms from those of the original derivative, the change may not have been made on an economically equivalent basis.
The IASB also noted that if a hedging instrument is derecognised, hedge accounting is required to be discontinued.
Therefore, the IASB decided that for hedge accounting to continue it is also necessary that the original hedging instrument would not be derecognised.
BC6.620 The IASB considered these approaches described by respondents
Under this approach, the counterparty to the new derivatives is the same as to the original derivative, the original derivative has not been derecognised and the terms of the alternative benchmark rate derivative are not substantially different from that of the original derivative.
The IASB disagreed with this view because the original derivative is extinguished and replaced with an alternative benchmark rate derivative with substantially different contractual terms.
The IASB noted that, in principle, the combination of an interest rate benchmark-based derivative and an interest rate benchmark-alternative benchmark rate swap could achieve an outcome economically equivalent to amending the original interest rate benchmark-based derivative.
However, the IASB observed that, in practice, basis swaps are generally entered into on an aggregated basis to economically hedge an entity's net exposure to basis risk, rather than on an individual derivative basis.
The IASB concluded that the most useful information would be provided to users of financial statements if requirements for recognition and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness remain unchanged (see paragraph BC6.567).
BC6.624 Applying the hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9, a gain or loss arising from the remeasurement of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk or from remeasuring the hedging instrument is reflected in profit or loss when measuring and recognising hedge ineffectiveness.
The IASB considered whether to provide an exception from the requirement to include in hedge ineffectiveness such fair value changes when they arise.
The IASB considered, but rejected, these approaches
The IASB rejected this approach because it would require an offsetting entry to be recognised either in the statement of financial position or as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item or hedging instrument.
However, the IASB rejected this approach because the changes to the hedged risk might be driven by amendments to hedging relationships that may occur in different reporting periods.
Therefore, recognising adjustments to retained earnings over time would be inconsistent with the IASB's previous decisions (throughout IFRS Standards) that an adjustment to retained earnings only applies on transition to new requirements in IFRS Standards.
Furthermore, the IASB noted that the measurement adjustment would meet the definition of income or expense in the Conceptual Framework and therefore should be recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
The IASB also noted that recognising measurement adjustments directly in retained earnings would be inconsistent with the decision that no exceptions should be made to the measurement of hedged items or hedging instruments.
Furthermore, the IASB observed that the requirement in paragraph 6.9.1(b) of IFRS 9, which requires the description of the designated portion for the cash flows or fair value being hedged enables entities to amend a hedging relationship to minimise fair value changes on the remeasurement of the hedged item or the hedging instrument.
As noted in paragraph 6.8.11 of IFRS 9, this exception ceases to apply to the hedged item and the hedging instrument, respectively, at the earlier of, when there is no longer uncertainty about the hedged risk or the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows; and when the hedging relationship that the hedged item and the hedging instrument are a part of is discontinued.
BC6.634 The approach described in paragraph BC6.633 is consistent with the IASB's view that, when a hedging relationship is amended for changes required by the reform, more useful information is provided to users of financial statements if hedge accounting is not discontinued and amounts are not reclassified to profit or loss solely due to the changes required by the reform.
The IASB observed that although a hedging relationship may have been discontinued, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve arising from that hedging relationship remains in the reserve if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur.
The IASB noted that if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur, the previously designated hedged item will be subject to a change required by the reform, even if the hedging relationship has been discontinued.
The IASB therefore considered that the cash flow hedge reserve is not remeasured as if it had been based on the alternative benchmark rate since inception of the hedging relationship.
The general reference to cash flow hedges in these paragraphs reflects such scope, therefore the IASB considered that explicitly addressing open or closed hedged portfolios was unnecessary.
BC6.640 The IASB considered that for groups of items designated as hedged items in a fair value or cash flow hedge, the hedged items could consist of items still referenced to the interest rate benchmark as well as items already referenced to the alternative benchmark rate.
Therefore, an entity could not amend the description of the hedged risk or the hedged item, including the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged, with reference only to an alternative benchmark rate for the whole group.
In the IASB's view, the same requirements and relief that apply to other hedging relationships should apply to groups of items designated as hedged items, including dynamic hedging relationships.
The IASB concluded this accounting outcome is appropriate because the basis for designating the hedged item on a group basis is that the entity is managing the designated hedge for the group as a whole.
Therefore, the IASB concluded that the benefits of avoiding the discontinuation of hedge accounting and the resulting accounting impacts outweigh the associated costs of this exception.
Therefore, the IASB observed that new items designated as part of the group to replace interest rate benchmark-based items that have matured would be allocated to the relevant subgroup based on the benchmark rate being hedged.
The IASB therefore decided that the identification of an appropriate hypothetical derivative is based on the requirements to measure hedge ineffectiveness and it would not be appropriate to include specific amendments for applying the requirements in paragraphs 6.9.9–6.9.10 to the hypothetical derivative.
The IASB considered that including an end date for that exception could require an entity to immediately discontinue hedge accounting at a point in time because, as the reform progresses, a risk component based on the interest rate benchmark may no longer be separately identifiable (for example, as the market for the alternative benchmark rate is established).
when the hedging relationship in which the non-contractually specified risk component was designated is discontinued.
on a hedge-by-hedge basis—that is, to each hedging relationship individually, beginning from the date an alternative benchmark rate is designated as a risk component in that relationship; or
However, the IASB acknowledged the diversity in the approaches to the reform or replacement of interest rate benchmarks and the timing of the expected completion across various jurisdictions.
Therefore, if the risk component is not reliably measurable, either when it is designated or thereafter, the alternative benchmark rate would not meet the qualifying criteria to be designated as a risk component in a hedging relationship.
The IASB decided that providing relief only for the separately identifiable requirement would achieve the objective described in paragraph BC5.290.
Effective date and transition (Chapter 7)
In addition, entities require time to implement new standards.
Most of an insurer's assets are financial assets and most of its liabilities are insurance liabilities or financial liabilities.
This would be disruptive for both users and preparers.
That is because there will be many possible combinations of which requirements are adopted early and which are not.
BC7.9 However, if an entity chooses to adopt a phase early, the IASB does not require the entity to adopt subsequent phases early.
The IASB decided that it would be unfair to require an entity to anticipate the outcomes of unfinished phases in order to make a decision about adopting a phase early.
In doing so, the IASB noted that there are compelling reasons for all project phases to be implemented at the same time and that, based on current circumstances, it is still appropriate to pursue an approach of requiring the same effective date for all phases of this project.
Ultimately this may affect the IASB's conclusion on the appropriateness of requiring the same mandatory effective date for all phases of this project.
The IASB decided that it will be able to determine the appropriate mandatory effective date only after it finalises the requirements for impairment and classification and measurement and has considered the lead time that is necessary to implement those new requirements.
Consequently, although they believe that sufficient time should be allowed for the implementation of IFRS 9, they expressed concern about any delay that is not strictly necessary.
entities would need to make system and model changes, in particular credit risk management systems, to monitor significant increases in credit risk and to modify credit risk models to incorporate appropriate forward-looking data;
entities may have limited availability of historical and trend information.
Such information is needed to build relevant models and incorporate forward-looking data in measuring expected credit losses;
entities would need to undertake parallel testing and running of new systems before final implementation; and
entities would need to consider the interaction of the expected credit loss requirements with various other regulatory reforms and regulatory capital requirements.
Respondents noted that resource constraints would hamper their efforts for a quicker implementation.
The relevant rationale is set out in paragraphs BC7.5, BC7.7–BC7.9 and BC7.9H–BC7.9I.
The relevant rationale is set out in paragraphs BC7.35–BC7.40.
Consequently, the IASB confirmed the proposals set out in paragraph BC7.9P.
In particular, many noted that the extensive exceptions to retrospective application that would be required to make such transition practicable significantly reduced (and possibly eliminated) any benefit that users might obtain from requiring comparative information to be restated.
BC7.12 The IASB considered whether to require prospective application, but noted that such an approach does not provide comparable information for users of financial statements.
In addition, the IASB noted that any transition approach (such as prospective application) that requires resetting the effective interest rate for financial assets measured at amortised cost reduces the usefulness of information about interest income.
BC7.13 The IASB decided to require retrospective application but provide transition relief to address particular difficulties that might arise from retrospective application.
Several loss events and reversals might have occurred between the date when the asset was initially recognised and the date of initial application of the Standard.
The IASB rejected proposals that entities should be permitted, but not required, to treat the fair value at the date of initial application as amortised cost because it would impair comparability and require significant guidance about when such an option should be permitted.
Moreover, an entity will not have the necessary information to determine fair value retrospectively without using hindsight.
Assessment of the objective of the entity's business model for managing financial assets
Assessment of qualifying criteria for the fair value option
Consequently, the IASB believes that an entity should reconsider at transition its original assessment of whether to designate a financial asset or financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss.
BC7.20 As noted above, many respondents were concerned that the inevitable exceptions to full retrospective application would result in restated information that is incomplete.
Many respondents questioned whether the date of initial application could be an arbitrary date between the date of issue of the Standard (or even earlier) and the mandatory effective date, resulting in a loss of comparability over a long period of time.
The IASB noted that the information necessary to make those disclosures would be readily available to the entity to make the necessary journal entries on transition and to account for the financial assets in the future.
(Paragraphs BC7.34A–BC7.34M and BC7.63–BC7.68 describe the IASB's subsequent decisions on disclosures at transition to IFRS 9.)
Consequently, entities are already calculating the information necessary to present the effects of changes in liabilities' credit risk in other comprehensive income.
The IASB confirmed that proposal.
BC7.27 The IASB did not change the classification and measurement approach for financial liabilities, including the eligibility conditions for the fair value option for financial liabilities.
Some respondents believed that the IASB should permit entities to reassess their designations in the light of the new requirements related to own credit risk.
Those changes require an entity to reassess liabilities designated under the fair value option to the extent that designation was originally elected to address an accounting mismatch.
Moreover, the IASB noted that the conclusion will most likely be the same regardless of whether it is made on the basis of facts and circumstances that existed at initial recognition of the liability or at the date of initial application.
Consistently with the requirements for financial assets, an entity will not have the necessary information to determine fair value retrospectively without using hindsight.
To avoid accounting mismatches in profit or loss, many insurers classify many of their financial assets as available-for-sale.
Either choice might lead to an accounting mismatch.
However, if the IASB did so, it would have to create detailed and arbitrary descriptions of the entities and instruments to which that approach would apply.
The IASB concluded that permitting the continuation of that category would not provide more useful information for users.
Shadow accounting for participating contracts
BC7.34 The IASB acknowledges that this accounting mismatch is undesirable.
The IASB did not intend to provide an alternative for investments in any other circumstances, including if an entity intends to hold an equity investment over a long time frame.
In the IASB's view, if an insurer holds investments with the primary objective of realising a profit from increases in their value, for the benefit of either the insurer itself or its policyholders, the most transparent place to present those value changes is in profit or loss.
At the time, the IASB's view was that waiving the requirement to restate comparative financial statements struck a balance between the conceptually preferable method of full retrospective application (as stated in IAS 8) and the practicability of adopting the new classification model within a short time frame.
These reasons were the interaction between the date of initial application and
the initial business model determination; and
the elections for the fair value option and the fair value through other comprehensive income presentation alternative at the date of initial application.
Investors, irrespective of their preferred approach, noted that the mix of transition requirements between phases, and the modifications to retrospective application in the classification and measurement phase, would diminish the usefulness of comparative financial statements.
Many also noted that the partial restatement of comparative financial statements could create either confusion or a misleading impression of period-to-period comparability.
Some of the respondents who favoured full retrospective application agreed that the modifications to retrospective application would diminish the usefulness of comparative financial statements but believed that the effect of the modifications would not be significant.
BC7.34H Due to the variation in transition requirements of the phases in the project to replace IAS 39, other investors did not favour the presentation of restated comparative financial statements.
They noted that the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (and restatement of it in comparative periods) is less important to their analysis than the statement of financial position, aside from situations where it allows for a link to the statement of financial position (for example net interest income).
Similarly, where restatement means primarily the presentation of historical fair value changes, comparative information is less useful as extrapolation is not possible in the same way as it is for amortised cost information.
The IASB believes that modified disclosures can achieve these objectives and decided to require modified transition disclosures instead of the restatement of comparative financial statements.
BC7.34M The IASB also considered whether the transition disclosures should be required if the entity presents restated comparative financial statements, or only if they are not provided.
The IASB also believed that the burden of these comparative transition disclosures for preparers would not be unreasonable because it was based largely on existing disclosure requirements and should require disclosure of information available as a result of preparing for transition.
Consequently, the IASB decided to require these disclosures even if restated comparative financial statements are provided.
Presentation of 'own credit' gains and losses on financial liabilities
That is because markets continued to be volatile and own credit gains or losses remained significant, which accentuated the concerns about the usefulness of presenting gains in profit or loss when an entity is experiencing deterioration in its own credit quality.
In effect, that would have made the availability of the own credit requirements for early application dependent on the implementation of an expected credit loss impairment model.
In other words, the IASB believed that the own credit requirements would be available for early application at roughly the same time under both approaches.
In such a scenario the entity adjusts the comparative information from the earliest date practicable.
However, in accordance with the proposals, a hedge accounting relationship could be designated only prospectively.
Consequently, retrospective application was not applicable.
This reflects that retrospective application gives rise to similar concerns about using hindsight as retrospective designation of hedging relationships, which is prohibited.
prospective application only for new hedging relationships; or
prospective application for all hedging relationships.
BC7.44 The IASB rejected the approach using prospective application of hedge accounting only for new hedging relationships.
Also, the proposed disclosures would be provided only for the hedging relationships accounted for in accordance with the proposed model.
This would make it difficult for users to compare the financial statements of different entities.
Comparability would also be difficult when entities apply the old and the new model in the same financial statements, as well as for information provided over time.
BC7.45 Consequently, the IASB proposed prospective application of the proposed hedge accounting requirements for all hedging relationships, while ensuring that 'qualifying' hedging relationships could be moved from the existing model to the proposed model on the adoption date.
BC7.48 Some respondents supported varying forms of retrospective application.
However, the IASB concluded that such hindsight would be limited because hedge accounting was applied to these hedging relationships under IAS 39, meaning that the changes in the intrinsic value of an option or the changes in the value of the spot element of a forward contract had to have a high degree of offset with the changes in value of the hedged risks.
The IASB also noted that retrospective application in these cases would significantly improve the usefulness of the information for the reasons that underpinned the IASB's decisions on accounting for the time value of options and the forward element of forward contracts (see paragraphs BC6.386–BC6.426).
For the forward element of forward contracts retrospective application is permitted but not required because unlike the new treatment for time value of options the new treatment for the forward element of forward contracts is an election.
However, in order to address the risk of using hindsight, the IASB decided that on transition this election is only available on an 'all-or-nothing' basis (ie not a hedge-by-hedge basis).
The restriction that retrospective application is available only on an 'all-or-nothing' basis does not apply to foreign currency basis spreads because of the variety of hedging instruments that involve those spreads.
Hence, the IASB considered that any specific transition requirements to address this request were unnecessary.
However, in order to address some concerns over potential practical transition issues in the context of prospective application, the IASB decided
The IASB decided to require the recognition of any gain or loss on rebalancing in profit or loss in a broadly similar manner for ongoing hedge accounting under the new model to address any concerns that hedge ineffectiveness might otherwise be recognised as a direct adjustment to retained earnings on transition.
The accounting is broadly similar to that for ongoing hedge accounting under the new model in that the hedge ineffectiveness in the context of rebalancing is recognised in profit or loss.
However, in contrast to ongoing hedge accounting under the new model, rebalancing on transition applies because a different hedge ratio has already been used for risk management purposes (but did not coincide with the designation of the hedging relationship under IAS 39).
In other words, rebalancing does not reflect a concurrent adjustment for risk management purposes but results in aligning the hedge ratio for accounting purposes with a hedge ratio that was already in place for risk management purposes.
To the extent that an entity wants to apply hedge accounting, those hedging relationships should be documented on or before the transition date.
Transition related to the limited amendments to the requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets
Assessment of an asset's contractual cash flow characteristics
Accordingly, the IASB proposed specific transition requirements for situations in which it is impracticable (for example, because of the risk of using hindsight) to assess a modified economic relationship on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at initial recognition of the financial asset.
BC7.55 Specifically, the IASB proposed that in cases in which it is impracticable for an entity to apply the assessment of an asset's contractual cash flow characteristics based on the new requirements, an entity would be required to make that assessment without taking into account the specific requirements related to the modified economic relationship.
That is because an entity will need to determine whether a prepayable financial asset meets the conditions set out in that paragraph on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset, including whether the fair value of the prepayment feature was insignificant.
The IASB noted that, in some cases, it may be impracticable for an entity to determine whether the fair value of the prepayment feature was insignificant at the date of initial recognition.
Consequently, the IASB decided that in cases in which it is impracticable for an entity to assess whether the fair value of a prepayment feature was insignificant based on the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the asset, the entity must assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset without taking into account the specific exception for prepayment features.
permitted to reconsider its fair value option elections for both financial assets and financial liabilities; that is, to elect to apply the fair value option even if an accounting mismatch already existed before the date of initial application and/or revoke the fair value option even if an accounting mismatch continues to exist; and
required to revoke its fair value option elections for both financial assets and financial liabilities if an accounting mismatch no longer exists at the date of initial application.
The relevant rationale is set out in paragraphs BC7.19 and BC7.27–BC7.28.
permitted to apply the fair value option to new accounting mismatches created by the initial application of the proposed amendments to the classification and measurement requirements; and
required to revoke previous fair value option elections if an accounting mismatch no longer exists as a result of the initial application of the proposed amendments to the classification and measurement requirements.
the usefulness of the disclosures;
the cost of providing such disclosures; and
The IASB observed that the concept of hedge accounting does not lend itself to making assumptions about what hedge accounting (under IAS 39) might have been.
That is because hedge accounting is an elective accounting treatment that allows the resolution of accounting mismatches.
In order to apply hedge accounting, an entity must make that election and then, if the hedging relationship meets the qualifying criteria, the entity prospectively applies hedge accounting.
In accordance with IAS 39, an entity can also discontinue hedge accounting at any time and for any reason (or for no reason).
This means that any IAS 39-based hedge accounting information 'as if applied in the current period' would be based on highly speculative assumptions.
The IASB noted that users of financial statements expressed support for these disclosures because they provide the necessary information to explain the transition.
If determining the credit risk on a financial instrument when the instrument was initially recognised would require undue cost or effort, the measurement of the loss allowance should always be determined only on the basis of whether the credit risk is low at the reporting date.
However, this requirement did not apply to financial instruments whose past due status is used to assess changes in credit risk, because it is assumed that the information will be available to make the assessment.
Entities were, however, permitted to provide restated comparative information if it is possible to do so without the use of hindsight.
Accordingly, there was a risk that hindsight would be needed to recognise and measure the amount of expected credit losses in prior periods.
Alternatives previously considered and rejected
This would have been a form of prospective application of the proposed requirements.
This grandfathering approach would have removed the need to measure expected credit losses for periods prior to the application of the proposed requirements, and would also have eliminated the problem of applying the proposed requirements to financial instruments for which information about the credit risk at initial recognition is not available or would have been very burdensome to obtain on transition to the proposed requirements.
It would also have allowed the IASB to specify an earlier mandatory effective date than would otherwise be possible if full retrospective application was required (ie retrospective application that also includes a restatement of comparative periods).
An entity would consider deteriorations or improvements in credit risk from the date of initial application of the proposed model, instead of relative to the credit risk at initial recognition.
The IASB rejected this approach because it would have ignored changes in credit risk that had occurred since initial recognition and would not have faithfully represented expected credit losses.
However, this alternative is inconsistent with the objective of the overall model, which is designed to reflect changes in credit risk.
This approach would also have resulted in an entity recognising lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments whose credit risk is actually better than that on initial recognition.
Availability of initial credit risk data
For financial instruments for which an entity has not used information about the initial credit risk on transition, an entity would recognise lifetime expected credit losses, except if the credit risk was low, at each reporting date until the financial instrument was derecognised.
BC7.78 The IASB considered that such an approach should be relatively simple to apply, because it would not require any assessment of changes in credit risk for these financial instruments relative to the initial credit risk.
In addition, it corresponds with credit risk management systems that assess credit risk as at the reporting date.
However, the IASB decided that this relief would not be appropriate when an entity uses the past due status of payments to apply the model, because in these cases an entity would have the necessary information to decide whether a financial instrument has deteriorated since initial recognition.
BC7.79 The IASB acknowledged that if an entity uses an approach that is based solely on credit risk at the reporting date, then, when the entity is deciding the amount of expected credit losses to recognise, that approach will not allow the entity to consider the increases in credit risk that have occurred since initial recognition.
Thus, entities would be required to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for a financial instrument for which the credit risk is not considered low, even if the instrument had been priced to reflect that risk and there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
It would also have a more negative impact for entities whose business model focuses on originating or purchasing financial instruments with credit risk that is not low (for example, their credit risk is not equivalent to investment grade).
Requiring an assessment of the credit risk alone might encourage the use of information about the initial credit risk on transition to the proposed requirements, which will enhance comparability and the quality of the information provided.
However, under some circumstances, such an approach may discourage the use of information about initial credit risk, particularly if an entity is able to absorb lifetime expected credit losses on those financial instruments on transition to the proposed requirements.
While acknowledging the inconsistency with the overall model, the IASB decided that such an approach was the best way to balance the provision of useful information with the associated cost of providing it.
Respondents noted that these proposals achieve a balance between the cost to implement the proposals and presenting relevant information.
However, respondents asked the IASB to consider practical ways in which to assess whether, at the date of initial application, there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition.
Respondents noted that the proposed requirements could effectively result in the loss allowance for all financial instruments that are not considered to have low credit risk to be measured at lifetime expected credit losses if the entity could not obtain information about the credit risk at initial recognition.
They argued that if financial instruments were inappropriately measured at lifetime expected credit losses, it might result in large releases of loss allowance balances when the instruments are derecognised.
BC7.81 The IASB considered that the intention was not to penalise entities that could not obtain information about the initial credit risk without undue cost or effort.
For example, the IASB noted that if an entity is able to assess the change in credit risk of a financial instrument on the basis of a portfolio analysis, such an approach could similarly be applied on transition to assess the change in credit risk since initial recognition.
Restatement of comparative periods, including the use of hindsight
This would prevent entities 'looking back' to make those determinations.
Instead, at the beginning of the period in which the proposed model were to be initially applied, an entity would adjust the loss allowance to be in accordance with the proposed model at that date, with an adjustment to an opening component of equity.
An entity would still apply the proposed model on a (modified) retrospective basis, because the loss allowance balances would be determined on the basis of information about initial credit risk, subject to the transition relief.
BC7.83 The IASB noted that another way to address the risk of hindsight might be to allow a long lead time between issuing the new requirements and the mandatory effective date, so that an entity could calculate expected credit losses contemporaneously for comparative periods to provide restated comparative information.
However, in considering a longer lead time, the IASB noted the urgency of this project.
Establishing a lead time that would allow an entity to apply the proposed model on a retrospective basis, including the provision of restated comparative information, in a way that addresses the risk of hindsight would result in a significant delay between issuing the final requirements and their mandatory application.
BC7.84 The vast majority of respondents agreed with the transition proposals not to require, but to allow, the restatement of comparative information if the necessary information is available without the use of hindsight.
Consequently, the IASB confirmed those proposals during redeliberations.
The IASB considered that allowing voluntary application of these amendments could lead to selective application to achieve specific accounting results.
The IASB also noted that the amendments are, to a large extent, interlinked and need to be applied consistently.
The IASB also does not expect that mandatory application of these amendments would result in significant additional costs for preparers and other affected parties because these amendments are designed to ease the operational burden on preparers, while providing useful information to users of financial statements, and would not require significantly more effort by preparers in addition to what is already required to implement the changes required by the reform.
This could be the case, for example, when a central authority, as the administrator of an interest rate benchmark, undertakes a multi-step process to replace an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate.
Thus, an entity could not apply this amendment in other circumstances in which the entity is not able to conclude that an alternative benchmark rate is a separately identifiable risk component.
The IASB therefore considered that discontinuation of hedge accounting solely because of amendments an entity made in hedge documentation to reflect appropriately the changes required by the reform, regardless of when those changes occurred, would not provide useful information to users of financial statements.
However, the IASB considered that in the specific circumstances of the reform, an entity would typically be able to reinstate a discontinued hedging relationship without the use of hindsight.
However, the IASB agreed with respondents' concerns that there could be other circumstances in which it would not be impracticable to reinstate the hedging relationship, but such reinstatement would be challenging or would have limited benefit.
The IASB also considers the comparative advantage that preparers have in developing information that would otherwise cost users of financial statements to develop.
The IASB therefore takes into account the benefits of economic decision-making resulting from improved financial reporting.
The IASB gains insight on the likely effects of the proposals for new or revised Standards through its formal exposure of proposals and through its analysis and consultations with relevant parties through outreach activities.
This Effects Analysis is based on the feedback received through this process.
BCE.3 The evaluation of costs and benefits are necessarily qualitative, instead of quantitative. This is because quantifying costs and, particularly, benefits, is inherently difficult.
Although other standard-setters undertake similar types of analyses, there is a lack of sufficiently well-established and reliable techniques for quantifying this analysis.
Consequently, the IASB sees this Effects Analysis as being part of an evolving process.
In addition, the assessment undertaken is that of the likely effects of the new requirements, because the actual effects will not be known until after the new requirements have been applied.
These are subsequently analysed through the Post-implementation Review process.
BCE.5 In evaluating the likely effects of the proposals, the IASB has considered how
activities would be reported in the financial statements of those applying IFRS;
comparability of financial information would be improved both between different reporting periods for the same entity and between different entities in a particular reporting period;
more useful financial reporting would result in better economic decision-making;
better economic decision-making as a result of improved financial reporting could be achieved;
the compliance costs for preparers would likely be affected; and
the costs of analysis for users of financial statements would likely be affected.
They have urged the IASB to develop a new Standard for the financial reporting for financial instruments that is principle-based and less complex.
introduce a logical and clear rationale for the classification and measurement of financial assets.
eliminate the complex requirements for bifurcating hybrid financial assets because financial assets will be classified in their entirety.
accommodate known business models with objectives to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows or that result in both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
respond to the long-standing concerns about the volatility that occurs in profit or loss due to changes in own credit risk when an entity elects to measure non-derivative financial liabilities at fair value.
But otherwise the existing accounting for financial liabilities has been retained because it has worked well in practice.
However, it is difficult to generalise the likely impact on these entities, because it depends on their individual circumstances.
In particular, the overall change in the classification of financial assets will depend on the choices previously made by preparers in applying IAS 39, their business models for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of their financial assets.
For example, a financial asset with contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding will be measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss, depending on the entity's business model (ie amortised cost if the financial assets are held to collect the contractual cash flows or fair value through other comprehensive income if the financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets and otherwise at fair value through profit or loss).
BCE.13 The IASB expects that most costs for preparers will be incurred on transition.
The ongoing costs will be mitigated primarily by the fact that
the business model assessment for the classification of a financial asset is determined on an aggregate basis and is a matter of fact (ie consistent with the entity's actual business model rather being simply an accounting concept);
the contractual cash flow assessment for financial assets need not be analysed in all business models; and
the requirements for the classification of financial liabilities are largely unchanged or should not create incremental costs (such as for the new own credit requirements given that entities are already required to disclose the gains or losses recognised for changes in own credit risk).
The IASB's assessment is that the significant improvements in terms of comparability and transparency will outweigh those costs.
How activities would be reported in the financial statements of those applying IFRS
BCE.15 The classification and measurement requirements are part of the IASB's response to a long recognised need to improve the accounting for financial instruments.
BCE.18 The requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities are largely unchanged from IAS 39, except for the own credit requirements, which was a response to long-standing concerns about the volatility that occurs in profit or loss because of changes in an issuer's own credit risk.
The eligibility criteria are a combination of the nature of the instrument, its manner of use and management choice.
The nature of the contractual cash flows is relevant to ensure that the cash flows on a financial asset can be properly and adequately reflected by amortised cost measurement, which is a simple technique for allocating interest over the life of a financial instrument.
Financial instruments were classified and measured at amortised cost only if
they are held in a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows ('held to collect' business model); and
their contractual cash flow terms represented solely payments of principal and interest.
Accordingly, a financial asset shall be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if
it is held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial instruments; and
In this measurement category the statement of financial position will reflect the fair value carrying amount while amortised cost information will be presented in profit or loss.
The difference between the fair value information and amortised cost information will be recognised in other comprehensive income.
This means that both amortised cost (ie information about contractual cash flows) and fair value information are relevant.
In addition to providing relevant and useful information for financial assets that are held within a 'hold to collect and sell' business model, the introduction of the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category also addresses potential accounting mismatches that could arise because of the interaction between the accounting for financial assets and the accounting for insurance contract liabilities.
Bifurcation of embedded features in financial assets
Consistently with all other financial assets, hybrid contracts with financial asset hosts are classified and measured in their entirety, thereby eliminating the complexity of bifurcation for financial assets.
Effect of classification on impairment
Some of those impairments could not be reversed.
Consequently, the same impairment model is applied for all financial assets that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss (ie financial assets measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income).
In addition, by using the same impairment model, amortised cost information is provided in profit or loss for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
For example, a change in a business model can arise from a business combination or if a reporting entity changes the way it manages its financial assets following the acquisition of a new business.
The cost exception for unquoted equity investments
Such financial instruments are measured at cost.
Dividends received from those investments are presented in profit or loss.
Gains and losses presented in other comprehensive income cannot be subsequently transferred to profit or loss (ie there is no recycling).
However, the entity may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
This would be the case, for example, if the entity holds those equity instruments primarily for non-contractual benefits.
However, such recycling of gains and losses would have made it necessary to introduce an impairment test to ensure that impairments were presented on a consistent basis.
The IASB thus decided that introducing recycling and associated impairment accounting would create application problems in practice and would not significantly improve or reduce the complexity of the financial reporting for financial assets.
The IASB considered specific requirements relating to that transfer, such as requiring the accumulated gain or loss to be transferred to retained earnings upon derecognition of the equity investment, but did not adopt such an approach because of jurisdiction-specific restrictions on components of equity.
For example, a transfer to retained earnings may give rise to tax consequences in some jurisdictions.
However, additional disclosures are required about investments in equity instruments with fair value changes presented in other comprehensive income to provide useful information to users of financial statements about the effect of that presentation for instruments presented in that manner.
Main changes to the approach to classifying and measuring financial liabilities
As a result, most financial liabilities, apart from derivatives or financial liabilities that an entity designates under the fair value option, will continue to be measured at amortised cost.
BCE.40 The main concern that the IASB was asked to address in relation to financial liabilities was the so-called 'own credit' issue, whereby changes in the credit risk of a financial liability give rise to gains or losses in profit or loss.
However, the requirement to present these fair value changes in other comprehensive income addressed the concern raised by many, including users of financial statements, that reflecting these fair value changes in profit or loss is counterintuitive and does not result in useful information.
In particular, the requirement addresses the concern that a gain is recognised in profit or loss as the credit risk on a financial liability increases (ie its credit quality deteriorates).
BCE.43 This allows entities to present the effects of own credit in other comprehensive income, thus improving their financial reporting, without also needing to make other changes to their accounting for financial instruments.
It makes the own credit requirements available on a more timely basis, particularly because an entity will be able to make this change before undertaking the changes that would be required in order to implement the expected credit loss impairment model.
Consequently, differences in financial reporting between reporting periods for an individual entity, and between different entities in a particular reporting period, will more often reflect the differences in underlying economics instead of resulting from differences in accounting choices.
Or, put another way, similar financial assets managed in the same way should be classified in the same way for accounting purposes.
This is not a question of intention for an individual instrument but is instead based on an assessment of objective evidence at a higher level of aggregation.
It expands the discussion about the activities that are commonly associated with the hold to collect business model, clarifying, for example, that entities do not need to hold all assets until maturity and that sales in themselves do not determine the objective of the business model (although information about sales can be useful in determining an entity's business model).
The clarifications are expected to improve comparability by enhancing the consistency in how different entities apply the hold to collect business model and classify their financial assets.
The fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category will allow some business models to be better reflected in the financial statements, improving comparability between entities with economically similar instruments that are managed in a similar way.
BCE.51 The reclassification requirements will enhance comparability because an entity will generally account for its financial instruments consistently over time. The exception will be in the rare circumstance that an entity's business model changes, in which case the required reclassification strengthens comparability because financial assets will be accounted for consistently with how they are managed.
Usefulness of financial information in assessing the future cash flows of an entity
BCE.52 In the Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 9, the IASB acknowledges that some users of financial statements support a single measurement method — fair value — for all financial assets.
However, the IASB continues to believe that both amortised cost and fair value can provide useful information to users of financial statements for particular types of financial assets in particular circumstances.
The IASB decided that if the measurement attribute for financial assets and the assets' effect on profit or loss are aligned with both the business model for managing financial assets and their contractual cash flow characteristics, financial reporting will provide relevant information about the timing, amounts and uncertainty of an entity's future cash flows.
BCE.53 The business model for managing financial assets determines whether their cash flows are realised through the collection of contractual cash flows, the sale of financial assets or both.
Consequently, the business model provides information that is useful in assessing the amounts, timing and uncertainty of the entity's future cash flows.
However, in contrast, if the objective of the business model is achieved by realising cash flows by selling financial assets, fair value measurement provides more relevant information about future cash flows in both the statement of financial position and in profit or loss.
The clarification will improve the quality of the financial information and its usefulness in assessing the amounts, timing and uncertainty of an entity's future cash flows by resulting in amortised cost measurement only for financial assets that are held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows.
This is considered appropriate for such a business model because, by design, both holding and selling activities are taking place, making both amortised cost and fair value information relevant to users of the financial statements.
This will allow entities to better reflect the way in which financial assets are managed and improves the usefulness of the information provided for those business models in assessing the timing, amounts and uncertainty of an entity's future cash flows.
Also, unlike the available-for-sale category in IAS 39, this measurement category has information content — it provides information about the entity's business model.
For example, it provides additional guidance about the attributes of cash flows that provide returns consistent with principal and interest and clarifies that interest is typically represented by a return for the time value of money and credit risk, but also can include other elements, such as a return for liquidity risk.
In addition, it clarifies that a financial asset does not have cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest if the effect of an interest rate tenor mismatch is significant, compared with the cash flows of an instrument that does not contain such a feature but is otherwise identical.
It eliminates the distinction between contingent prepayment and extension features and other types of contingent features, clarifying that all contingent features must be assessed in the same way and irrespective of the nature of the contingent event itself.
As a result of these clarifications, the IASB expects that financial instruments considered to pay solely principal and interest will be better aligned with the economic concept of principal and interest.
BCE.59 The IASB was also made aware of regulated interest rates in some jurisdictions that are created with an objective of providing a return that is economically consistent with principal and interest, and that do not introduce volatility that is inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement.
However, there is a mismatch between the interest rate set and the duration of the interest rate period.
The IASB believes that the concern is addressed for some financial assets by the clarifications to the principal and interest criterion outlined above.
This is because, despite the presence of embedded features, these financial assets may economically have principal and interest cash flows.
This is expected to be the case, for example, for many financial instruments with regulated interest rates and financial instruments with interest rate tenor mismatches.
For the reasons discussed in detail in paragraphs BC4.88–BC4.89 and BC4.196–BC4.204, the IASB believes that classifying financial assets in their entirety instead of bifurcating them will result in financial information that is more useful in assessing the amounts, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows.
When a financial asset was bifurcated, the components of that financial asset were measured in different ways, and could also have been presented in different places in the financial statements.
Consequently, although the settlement of the financial asset takes into consideration all of its contractual terms, it was difficult to understand that financial asset as a whole until settlement took place.
BCE.62 In IFRS 9, the IASB made fewer changes to the classification and measurement of financial liabilities than to financial assets.
Views received from users of financial statements, and others, indicated that amortised cost is the most appropriate measurement attribute for many financial liabilities, because it reflects the issuer's legal obligation to pay the contractual amounts in the normal course of business (ie on a going concern basis) and, in many cases, the issuer plans to hold liabilities to maturity and pay the contractual amounts.
BCE.63 However, if a liability has structured features (for example, embedded derivatives), amortised cost is difficult to apply and understand because the cash flows can be highly variable.
The bifurcation approach also reduces the incidence of fair value changes caused by the issuer's own credit risk.
However, many users of financial statements confirmed that fair value information on the balance sheet does provide useful information because, for example, it can provide early information about an entity's credit problems.
The result of the IASB's decisions, including the own credit requirements for financial liabilities described in paragraphs BC5.35–BC5.64, result in information being reported for financial liabilities that is more useful in assessing the amounts, timing and uncertainty of the entity's future cash flows.
BCE.65 The IASB noted that prima facie it would seem preferable to eliminate bifurcation for financial liabilities if it was eliminated for financial assets.
However, in discussions with users of financial statements they did not raise concerns regarding this apparent asymmetry in treatment.
Measuring those instruments at fair value provides the most relevant information to users of financial statements, because, although cost is a reliable and objective amount, it provides little, if any, information with predictive value about the timing, amount and uncertainty of future cash flows arising from the instrument.
Because equity instruments do not have cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest, the IASB believes that fair value information is always relevant, irrespective of the business model in which the asset is held.
In addition, the IASB believes that changes in the fair value of equity investments usually provide relevant information about an entity's performance and should therefore be included in profit or loss.
However, the IASB acknowledges that for some equity investments information about fair value may not be considered relevant to profit or loss, such as when an investment is held for strategic purposes.
Because this presentation choice was designed for circumstances in which these fair value changes were not relevant to profit or loss, even though the category is not expressly limited to these circumstances, the IASB decided that gains or losses would not be recycled to profit or loss.
Without an impairment model, recycling could not be allowed because of the risk of asymmetry caused by recognising gains in profit or loss with the risk that losses would be retained in other comprehensive income by avoiding derecognition.
This would risk reducing the usefulness and representational faithfulness of the information provided.
BCE.69 Some have expressed concerns that this approach may create a disincentive for entities to invest in equity instruments.
However, if an entity is of the view that the users of its financial statements need to see the effects in profit or loss of holding equity investments, they need not elect the other comprehensive income presentation.
If the other comprehensive income presentation is elected, entities can choose to present the effects of realising fair value changes by, for example, transferring accumulated gains or losses from other comprehensive income to retained earnings.
Users of financial statements consistently commented that these reclassifications decreased the comparability and usefulness of financial reporting.
Better economic decision-making as a result of improved financial reporting
reduce accounting choice and instead require classifications that are consistent with economic substance.
It is also more complete and neutral and is supported by economic substance, which will help it to be free from error and verifiable.
For example, regulated entities (especially banks) are often required to maintain a minimum level of capital reserves.
Decreases in the fair value of some financial assets may impact the level of those capital reserves.
As a consequence, some expressed concern that regulated entities may decrease lending during an economic downturn, which can further exacerbate the downturn.
Consequently, the IASB believes that the new approach to classifying and measuring financial instruments will provide relevant information that will lead to better economic decision-making throughout economic cycles.
BCE.74 The IASB did not seek to increase or reduce the number of financial instruments that would be measured at fair value.
In addition, financial assets are measured at fair value only when it is relevant because of the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset and/or the entity's business model.
For example, because of the rule-based criteria for amortised cost measurement under IAS 39, debt securities that are quoted in active markets are typically measured at fair value in accordance with IAS 39, even if they are held within a business model in which assets are managed to collect contractual cash flows.
BCE.75 The effect on the classification of an entity's financial assets will depend on the choices it made when applying IAS 39, its business models for managing its financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of those financial assets.
Entity X invests in a portfolio of bonds that are quoted in an active market.
The entity generally holds the investments in order to collect their contractual cash flows but would sell them if the instrument no longer meets the credit criteria specified in the entity's documented investment policy (for example, if a bond's credit risk increases so that it is higher than the credit limit as defined by the investment policy for that class of financial instruments at the reporting date).
Instrument A is a bond that pays principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
In accordance with IAS 39, the entity classified Instrument A as available-for-sale because of the restrictions and tainting rules associated with the held-to-maturity category.
At transition to IFRS 9, the entity reclassifies Instrument A to be measured at amortised cost because
In contrast, consider the same fact pattern except that the entity invests in the bonds to achieve the business model's objective by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling bonds.
the financial assets are managed to achieve the business model's objective by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
The entity holds the bonds to collect the contractual cash flows.
In accordance with IAS 39, Entity Y separated the embedded derivative from the financial asset host and measured the embedded derivative at fair value through profit or loss.
The host financial asset was classified as available-for-sale.
At transition to IFRS 9, Entity Y applies the classification approach to the hybrid financial instrument as a whole.
Consequently, it measures the hybrid financial instrument in its entirety at fair value though profit or loss despite a business model that is a 'hold to collect' model.
This is because the contractual cash flows introduce exposure to changes in equity prices that do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Thus, the contractual cash flows are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement and the instrument must be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Entity Z invests in senior tranches of securitised bonds that are collateralised by mortgage loans.
The underlying mortgage loans have payments that are solely payments of principal and interest.
Entity Z invests in these senior tranches in order to collect contractual cash flows.
The credit risk of the tranches is lower than that of the overall mortgage pool.
In accordance with IAS 39, Entity Z determined that there is not an embedded derivative and classified its investment in these senior tranches as available-for-sale.
At transition to IFRS 9, if the contractual terms of the senior tranches give rise to payments that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, Entity Z measures its investments at amortised cost.
However, if the contractual payments are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (that is, they are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement), the senior tranche must be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
However, the addition of the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category will only have this potential adverse effect on regulatory capital if those financial assets would otherwise have been measured at amortised cost.
Some financial assets held in business models that would have been measured at fair value through profit or loss can now be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
The IASB notes that the objective of providing useful information does not contradict the objective of economic stability.
Instead, the IASB believes that transparency is essential to maintain stability in the long term.
The likely effect on compliance costs for preparers, both on initial application and on an ongoing basis
BCE.79 As with all new requirements, the IASB acknowledges that different areas of the requirements will have different effects and hence different types of costs and benefits will arise when considering both preparers and users of financial statements.
Given that the new classification model for financial assets is based on the entity's business model for managing its financial assets and those assets' contractual cash flow characteristics, it is reasonable to conclude that the costs incurred and the benefits obtained in complying with the new requirements will depend on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of its financial assets.
developing new processes, systems and controls;
undertaking the initial analysis of business models and contractual cash flows on transition;
creating capabilities for new eligible presentations, if intended to be used (for example, the presentation of the change in the fair value of equity investments in other comprehensive income);
educating accounting functions and obtaining expert advice for compliance; and
It is therefore difficult to generalise the likely impact on transition on preparers and on their costs.
An entity's business model is a matter of fact that can be observed by the way in which an entity is managed and information is provided to its management.
The assessment is based on, for example, business plans and internal reporting, which should be available.
Thus, the reporting is in a manner consistent with the entity's actual business model and entities need not maintain dual reporting models for internal and external reporting.
the contractual cash flows need not be analysed in all business models.
They only need to be analysed to assess cash flows for the held to collect and the held to collect or sell business models.
BCE.83 In addition, the IASB notes that eliminating bifurcation and tainting for financial assets measured at amortised cost, as well as introducing a single impairment method, will simplify compliance with the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets.
BCE.84 Furthermore, for financial liabilities, the classification and measurement model is largely unchanged from IAS 39, except for the own credit requirements for financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option.
Entities are already required to disclose the gains or losses recognised for changes in own credit risk and therefore there should not be any incremental costs to preparers from this change.
The IASB believes that this will help to reduce the initial and ongoing costs of compliance with the classification and measurement requirements.
The likely effect on costs of analysis for users of financial statements
BCE.87 The likely benefits of improved reporting are expected to outweigh the costs of analysis for users of financial statements.
However, the extent of the benefit will depend on existing practices.
In addition, although some users of financial statements favour fair value as a primary measurement attribute for all financial assets, users of financial statements as a group have consistently said that both amortised cost information and fair value information are useful in particular circumstances.
In addition, accompanying disclosures provide information that will enable users of financial statements to understand how financial instruments have been classified and measured, and supplementary information from disclosures is available to be used in their financial modelling (for example, the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortised cost).
BCE.89 The requirements result in more relevant and transparent information because they introduce a single classification approach for all financial assets, which always provides users of financial statements with information that reflects how the cash flows on financial assets are expected to be realised given the entity's business model and the nature of the contractual cash flows.
In addition, they respond to long standing concerns about the volatility that occurs in profit or loss due to changes in an issuer's own credit risk that was not considered to provide useful information, when an entity elects to measure non-derivative financial liabilities at fair value.
The Financial Crisis Advisory Group (FCAG) and others recommended exploring alternatives to the incurred loss model that would use more forward-looking information.
BCE.91 The complexity of having multiple impairment models for financial instruments was also identified as a major concern.
The IASB believes that the new impairment requirements address the issue of delayed recognition of credit losses and the complexity of multiple impairment models for financial instruments.
This removes a major source of current complexity.
more timely information will be provided about expected credit losses.
The requirements eliminate the threshold for recognising credit losses so that it would no longer be necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised.
Instead, expected credit losses and changes in expected credit losses are always recognised.
The amount of expected credit losses will be updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition.
the requirements broaden the information that an entity is required to consider when accounting for credit losses.
An entity is required to base its measurement of expected credit losses on relevant information about past events, including historical credit loss information for similar financial instruments, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
Thus, the effects of future credit loss expectations need to be considered.
As a result of the broadening of the information that is required to be considered, the impairment model will be more forward looking.
BCE.94 Some interested parties would prefer an impairment model that results in a 'conservative', or prudential, depiction of expected credit losses.
Those parties are concerned about higher or lower loss allowances or the 'adequacy' of the loss allowance.
They argue that such a depiction would better meet the needs of both the regulators who are responsible for maintaining financial stability and of investors.
However, the debate about higher or lower loss allowances or the adequacy of the loss allowance in isolation is primarily a debate for prudential regulators instead of accounting standard-setters.
The IASB's objective is not to require higher or lower loss allowances; instead it is to present information to users of financial statements that is neutral and portrays the economic characteristics of the financial instrument at the reporting date.
This is consistent with the objectives of financial reporting and the qualitative characteristics in the Conceptual Framework.
In particular, investments will be required in substantial system changes.
The IASB's assessment is that the significant improvements in terms of timeliness of information about expected credit losses and transparency will outweigh those costs.
BCE.97 Conceptually, when an entity prices a financial instrument, the credit risk premium in the yield compensates the entity for the initial expected credit losses.
For example, at the time of lending, the margin on a financial instrument compensates the lender for the credit risk of the borrower.
This means that loss expectations do not give rise to an economic loss at initial recognition.
In contrast, subsequent increases in the credit risk of the borrower represent an economic loss.
These changes represent an economic loss because they are not priced into the financial instrument.
Ideally, to reflect this an entity would include the initial estimate of the expected credit losses in determining the effective interest rate used to recognise interest revenue.
Thus, the initial expected credit losses would adjust the interest revenue over the life of the financial asset.
The entity would then recognise impairment gains or losses only when changes in the expected credit losses occur.
Users of financial statements have told the IASB that they support an impairment model that distinguishes between the effect of initial estimates of expected credit losses and subsequent changes in those loss expectations.
At each reporting date, expected credit losses are measured using updated information.
Some of those financial asset impairments cannot be reversed.
During the global financial crisis, some users of financial statements were confused because the same financial assets were impaired differently simply because they were classified differently for accounting purposes.
Some questioned the relevance of fair value-based impairment if a financial asset would not be realised through sale.
In addition, holding financial assets to collect contractual cash flows is an integral feature of the business model.
The IASB therefore believes that an impairment model that is based on shortfalls in contractual cash flows and changes in credit risk, instead of changes in fair value, more faithfully reflects the economic reality of expected credit losses that are associated with these financial assets.
It is also consistent with both amortised cost and fair value information about these financial assets being provided to the users of financial statements, which was the IASB's objective in introducing the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category.
This was the case even though exposure to credit risk on these instruments is similar to that on loans or other financial instruments and the credit risk is managed in the same way.
The IASB therefore concluded that an entity shall apply the same impairment model to those loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
Aligning the impairment requirements for all credit exposures irrespective of their type reduces operational complexity because, in practice, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts are often managed using the same credit risk management approach and information systems.
It requires that the estimates of cash flows are expected values.
Consequently, estimates of the amounts and timing of cash flows are the probability-weighted possible outcomes.
In the IASB's view, an expected value measurement provides relevant information about the timing, amounts and uncertainty of an entity's future cash flows.
It provides information about the risk that the investment might not perform.
The amount of expected credit losses will reflect both the risk of a default occurring and the loss amount that would arise if a default were to occur.
This is because all financial instruments have a risk of a default occurring.
Timely recognition of expected credit losses
As a result, the effect of future events, even when expected, cannot be considered.
This recognition threshold is perceived to have caused a delay in the recognition of credit losses and was identified during the global financial crisis as a weakness in accounting standards.
It also resulted in differences in application because the recognition threshold was applied differently between entities.
This enables economic credit losses to be better reflected in the financial statements.
Despite the concerns about the application of judgement, in the IASB's view, the new impairment model will improve the comparability of reported amounts.
In addition, in practice, the point at which losses were considered to be incurred varied between entities.
BCE.112 In the IASB's view, considering the term structure and initial credit risk when assessing whether lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised will better reflect existing models for measuring credit risk and improve the comparability of the requirements for financial instruments with different maturities and different initial credit risk.
Both qualitative and quantitative disclosures are necessary to assist users of financial statements in understanding and comparing different measures of expected credit losses.
The IASB believes that this will lead to greater comparability between different reporting periods of the same entity and assist in enabling comparisons to be made between entities.
Usefulness of financial information in assessing future cash flows of an entity
In the IASB's view, a general provisioning approach, whereby entities build up reserves to absorb both expected and unexpected credit losses (without any reference to an increase in credit risk) lacks any measurement objective and fails to provide a link between the loss allowance that is recognised and the change in credit risk.
Furthermore, a full fair value model does not provide explicit information on expected credit losses.
Changes in the fair value of a financial instrument include changes in risks other than credit risk, such as interest rate risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The IASB believes that such an approach does not provide useful information for impairment purposes, because measuring expected credit losses using fair value information is inconsistent with a cost-based measurement that focuses on contractual cash flows.
BCE.116 In the IASB's view, the criterion that determines when lifetime expected credit losses shall be recognised, together with the related disclosure requirements, achieves the best balance between the benefits of distinguishing financial instruments for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and the costs and complexity of making that assessment.
Under such an approach, the recognition of initial lifetime expected credit losses is triggered by the initial recognition of a financial asset instead of by the increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
The IASB believes that this is not appropriate because it would result in financial assets being recognised at a carrying amount that is significantly below fair value on initial recognition and would therefore be inconsistent with the economics of the asset.
However, the IASB acknowledges that some users of financial statements find this information useful.
The feedback to the IASB from the majority of users of financial statements has been that this distinction provides useful information.
The IASB believes that such a symmetrical approach faithfully represents the economics of the transaction and that faithful representation should not be sacrificed for anti-abuse purposes.
This includes historical, current and forward-looking information and an assessment of the credit risk over the remaining life of the instrument, which should include the circumstances that led to the modification.
Users of financial statements will also be provided with more information to understand entities' credit risk management processes and the credit risk inherent in their financial instruments.
The IASB is of the view that loss allowances should reflect credit loss expectations for financial instruments as at the reporting date.
In addition, the overstatement will not be of the same magnitude as if full lifetime expected credit losses were to be recognised on initial recognition.
BCE.124 Furthermore, relevant information is provided by updating expected credit loss estimates for changes in expectations, by updating the measurement of the loss allowance at each reporting date, and in particular through the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
In addition, information is provided by requiring the calculation of interest revenue on the amortised cost amount (ie net of the loss allowance) of a financial asset when it becomes credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition.
Regulatory concept of expected credit losses
BCE.125 Some users of financial statements asked the IASB to ensure that the impairment model is both aligned to the prudential capital frameworks and is counter-cyclical, resulting in a loss allowance that is sufficient to absorb all credit losses.
However, these estimates only use credit loss experience based on historical events to set out 'provisioning' levels over the entire economic cycle ('through-the-cycle').
This would result in a loss allowance that is not designed to reflect the economic characteristics of the financial instruments at the reporting date.
In addition, the default measures used may be adjusted to reflect a more 'conservative' outlook instead of actual expectations.
However, the IASB believes that the objective of financial reporting should be to provide transparent information that is useful to a broad range of users of financial statements and that prudential regulators are best placed to consider how to address the interaction between IFRS and the regulatory requirements.
The IASB has discussed the new impairment model and shared information with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision — through its Accounting Experts Group — throughout the course of the project in order to enable the interaction of the new impairment model with relevant regulatory requirements to be considered.
The actual effect on regulatory capital will depend on the decisions made by relevant regulators about the interaction between the IFRS impairment requirements and the prudential requirements.
Some users of financial statements would however prefer a representation of credit losses with a conservative or prudential bias, arguing that such a representation would better meet both the needs of regulators who are responsible for maintaining financial stability and those of investors.
The majority of users of financial statements that the IASB discussed the impairment requirements with, however supported an impairment model that focuses on expected credit losses and the changes in credit risk since initial recognition.
A key objective of the fieldwork was to understand how responsive the proposed impairment model was expected to be to changes in credit risk expectations over time.
However, in order to make the exercise as representative as possible, participants included both financial and non-financial (lessor) entities, multinational and regional (or country)-based businesses, Basel-regulated and non-Basel-regulated entities and entities with various levels of sophistication in credit risk management systems.
revolving credit products (for example, credit cards);
lease receivables (for example, vehicle finance); and
In addition, by necessity participants could only use information provided as part of the fieldwork or that existed in their credit risk management systems.
This meant that the approaches taken could not fully represent those which may ultimately be undertaken.
So for retail portfolios, participants were often only able to identify significant increases in credit risk based on past due information plus some adjustments (for example, including restructurings).
They found it difficult to incorporate more forward-looking data (for example, macroeconomic data) at a level that enabled them to identify specific financial assets for which there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition.
The work with participants showed that statistical methods and techniques could be used to analyse subportfolios to capture significant increases in credit risk even when that is not evident based on customer-specific information at the level of individual financial instruments.
During an upturn, the loss allowances recovered faster than those under IAS 39, which often still had a lagging effect from the downturn in the economic cycle.
Participants noted that the better an entity is able to incorporate forward-looking and macroeconomic data into its credit risk management models, the more responsive the loss allowance would be to changes in credit risk.
Finally, participants noted jurisdictional differences because of different macroeconomic factors that affect expected credit losses and therefore the loss allowance.
BCE.139 The IASB notes that it cannot quantify the magnitude of the impact of moving to the new impairment model on an entity's financial reporting.
The loss allowance always reflects expectations at the reporting date, so economic conditions at the date of initial application (including forecasts of economic conditions) will affect the loss allowance.
The effect on transition will also depend on the information that an entity has available on transition.
The likely effect on compliance costs for preparers, both at initial application and on an ongoing basis
This is intended to ensure that only meaningful changes in credit risk are captured that should align with changes that would be monitored for credit risk management.
BCE.142 The IASB acknowledges that the implementation and ongoing application of an impairment model based on expected credit losses is complex and costly.
monitoring changes in credit risk of financial instruments since initial recognition and implementing processes to make that assessment; and
calculating expected credit losses including lifetime expected credit losses.
Although such a difference in perspective is likely to add cost and complexity to the impairment model, the IASB believes that it is justified because of the underlying concept that a loss only arises when the credit loss expectations on a financial instrument exceed those that are considered when pricing the instrument.
Thus, this approach provides information that is useful for users of financial statements.
BCE.144 The implementation of the impairment model will require system changes that may be substantial, and time and resource commitments, resulting in significant costs for most entities with substantial amounts of financial instruments subject to impairment accounting including financial institutions that are already calculating expected credit losses for regulatory purposes.
Entities will need to develop new systems and controls to integrate information produced for credit risk management purposes, or elsewhere in their business, into their accounting process.
However, these costs are mitigated because the impairment model is based upon changes in credit risk that should be monitored for credit risk management purposes and enables a variety of approaches to be taken to identify such changes, enabling entities to use credit risk information as a basis for implementation.
An entity may, for example, in cases in which the credit risk at origination is similar for particular portfolios, segment its portfolios by credit risk at origination and assess increases in credit risk by comparing the credit risk at the reporting date with the initial credit risk for the relevant portfolio.
Thus, the costs of applying the criteria to determine whether lifetime expected credit losses must be recognised would vary depending on the diversity of initial credit risk and the sophistication of credit risk management systems.
BCE.147 In addition, the IASB clarified that on initial application of the impairment requirements, entities are permitted to use reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort to approximate the credit risk at initial recognition of a financial instrument.
Participants in outreach activities and in the fieldwork noted that they would often not have the original credit risk information at transition, which could result in financial instruments being measured inappropriately at lifetime expected credit losses (ie when there have not been in fact a significant increase in credit risk).
The IASB clarified the transition requirements because its intention is not to penalise those entities that could not obtain information about the initial credit risk without undue cost or effort.
This clarification will enhance the operability of the impairment model and reduce preparers' costs on transition.
BCE.148 For the calculation of expected credit losses (and in particular for the calculation of lifetime expected credit losses), systems need to be updated or newly developed.
Field participants used different methods to calculate expected credit losses and noted, for example, that current systems do not discount cash flows used to determine expected credit losses or may discount only to the date of expected default.
As a result, systems would need to be modified to discount expected cash flows to the reporting date and to capture the expected timing of credit losses better.
Those costs arise on transition to establish the capability to provide those disclosures but will also include ongoing costs.
However, if entities embed this in their systems that they use for preparing their financial statements, the ongoing costs can be reduced.
BCE.151 The requirement to change the recognition of interest revenue from a gross basis to a net basis at a different level of increase in credit risk compared to when lifetime expected credit losses are recognised (ie when credit losses are incurred) adds a further level of complexity.
When information was not readily available internally, participants indicated that information is obtainable in the market to enable this to be determined.
This would have led to significant operational challenges and substantial costs, because the effective interest rate information is not contained in the same systems as the credit risk information.
It only requires the effective interest rate to be adjusted for a limited population of financial assets — those that are purchased or originated credit impaired.
BCE.154 Some preparers, particularly credit risk managers, indicated that the tracking of credit risk, in most circumstances, is simpler and more closely aligned to credit risk management practices than the tracking of expected credit losses.
BCE.155 Some interested parties are concerned that the distinction between financial instruments whose credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition and financial instruments for which this has not occurred will be operationally challenging.
However, any impairment model that is based on expected credit losses will require monitoring of changes in credit risk to update the expected credit loss amounts.
Consequently, differentiating significant changes in credit risk from those that are not, is only an incremental cost to any other impairment model based on expected credit losses.
They stated that this is similar to their credit risk management actions.
In addition, it is also expected to be less costly compared to measuring lifetime expected credit losses for all financial instruments.
In addition, they observed that lifetime expected credit losses were more sensitive to the underlying assumptions.
Their results from the fieldwork showed that updated macroeconomic forecasts led to more volatility in an impairment model based on lifetime expected credit losses for all financial instruments because of the extrapolation effects.
Finally, they stated that recognising lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments that have not increased significantly in credit risk is not reflective of the economics of their business.
However, the IASB had no intention to prescribe a specific or mechanistic approach to assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
This addresses different levels of sophistication and reduces the operational burden to assess whether a financial instrument shall be measured at lifetime expected credit losses.
Consequently, if an entity applies this simplification, it will not need to assess the change in credit risk from initial recognition for financial instruments that have low credit risk on a reporting date (for example, financial instruments whose credit risk is equivalent to investment grade).
BCE.159 Some preparers were concerned that lifetime expected credit losses would need to be determined for each individual financial instrument, which would add to the operational burden of tracking.
Financial instruments that share common risk characteristics can be assessed on a collective basis.
This is because it would be contrary to credit risk management and regulatory reporting, which could result in loss allowances that do not represent the credit losses expected on the off-balance sheet exposures resulting in outcomes for which no actual loss experience exists on which to base the estimates.
Participants in the fieldwork who applied the proposed impairment model to credit cards also raised these concerns and suggested that the expected credit loss on these types of loan commitments should be estimated over the behavioural life instead of the contractual life of the instrument.
This change should enable the measurement of expected credit losses to be more closely aligned to credit risk management systems and enable the loss allowance to more faithfully represent expected credit losses on those exposures.
does not require lifetime expected credit losses to be determined for all financial instruments;
has a 'low credit risk' simplification (see paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9);
allows entities to use past due information to implement the model (in conjunction with more forward-looking information that is reasonably available without undue cost or effort);
does not require a specific approach for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, thus enabling entities to build upon their credit risk management information;
clarifies that significant increases in credit risk can be assessed on an individual instrument or a portfolio basis; and
For example, when assessing significant increases in credit risk, entities shall consider all internal and external information that is reasonably available without undue cost or effort.
This may mean that entities with little historical information would draw their estimates from internal reports and statistics (which may, for example, have been generated when deciding whether to launch a new product), information that they have about similar products or from peer group experience for comparable financial instruments.
BCE.165 Disclosures are a major contributor to the overall benefits of the model.
With this in mind, the IASB decided on a number of changes and clarifications to reduce the burden of compliance while still providing the information needed by the users of the financial statements.
Given the feedback raised on operational concerns, the IASB made the disclosure less prescriptive and more principle-based by clarifying that its objective is to provide information about the significant changes in the gross carrying amount that contributed to changes in the loss allowance during the period.
In particular, the disclosures are intended to enable users of the financial statements to differentiate between the effects of changes in the amount of exposure (for example, those due to increased lending) and the effect of changes in credit risk.
The IASB considers that the requirement, as clarified, is less operationally burdensome but still provides useful information to users of financial statements.
BCE.167 Another important disclosure is the disclosure about modified financial assets.
Instead, entities shall now only disclose financial assets modified during the reporting period.
This still provides an important source of information about the amount of restructuring activity being undertaken while being less burdensome.
BCE.168 The IASB believes that users of financial statements will benefit from the timelier information provided about credit risk and the changes in credit risk.
However, the IASB did not want to create an 'artificial' disincentive for entities to lend to customers with higher credit risk.
Furthermore, the IASB believes that full lifetime expected credit losses should not be recognised on initial recognition irrespective of the initial credit risk because financial instruments are priced reflecting initial credit risk expectations.
In particular, the IASB was concerned about the effect on the balance sheet carrying amount at initial recognition that would result if lifetime expected credit losses were recognised from inception.
BCE.171 The IASB acknowledges that it would be preferable for users of financial statements if the accounting for expected credit losses was aligned between IFRS and US GAAP.
However, the IASB noted that it was important to improve impairment accounting in accordance with IFRS.
BCE.172 The IASB acknowledges that the assessment of changes in credit risk since initial recognition inherently involves a significant amount of subjectivity and therefore reduces the verifiability and comparability of reported amounts.
This inevitably results in costs of analysis to users of financial statements.
For example, a reconciliation is required between the opening balance and the closing balance of the loss allowance and the gross carrying amount of financial assets, which the IASB considers provides useful information about the development and evolution of expected credit losses.
Disclosure is also required of information about financial assets with a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses that have been modified, including the gross carrying amount of the financial assets and the gain or loss resulting from the modification.
Information on modifications is responsive to requests for enhanced information in this area from users of financial statements, because this information was found to be inadequate during the global financial crisis.
BCE.173 The IASB expects that the requirements will provide timelier and more representationally faithful information about an entity's current estimates of expected credit losses and the changes in those estimates over time for all financial instruments subject to impairment accounting.
In addition, the requirements include a comprehensive package of disclosures that will help investors to understand the judgements, assumptions and information used by an entity in developing its estimates of expected credit losses.
As a result, more relevant and transparent information will be provided to users of financial statements.
The IASB also had extensive discussions with regulators and audit firms worldwide.
The analysis in paragraphs BCE.175–BCE.238 is based on the feedback received through this process.
Hedge accounting relates to the reporting of risk management activities that entities enter into, to manage their exposures to the risks identified as relevant, from a business perspective.
This has been caused not only by entities' increasing willingness and ability to manage their exposures, but also by the increased availability of financial instruments to manage those exposures.
They involved trying to fit transactions that were originated for risk management purposes into an accounting framework that was largely divorced from the purpose of the transactions.
BCE.178 This also caused difficulties for users of financial statements when trying to understand the information reported in financial statements.
Some users of financial statements regarded hedge accounting as being incomprehensible and often removed its effects from their various analyses.
Users frequently argued that they had to request additional information (often on a non-GAAP basis) to be able to perform their analyses (for example, making forecasts), because the way in which the hedging activities were accounted for and the disclosures that were provided were often considered not to portray risk management in a useful way.
This led to entities presenting non-GAAP information in various ways, with various levels of detail across different documents that range from the Management Discussion and Analysis to investor presentations.
In addition, entities will be able to use information that they have prepared for the purpose of undertaking their hedging activities as the basis for demonstrating compliance with the hedge accounting requirements.
These amendments to hedge accounting will affect a variety of entities, including both financial and non-financial institutions.
The new model will benefit from a more principle-based approach, including the revised eligibility criteria both for hedged items and hedging instruments, and a new objective-based hedge effectiveness assessment.
In addition a targeted solution has been introduced for hedges of credit risk using credit derivatives.
Entities dealing with hedging of non-financial items are likely to have significant benefits, albeit with some costs to be incurred when implementing the new model.
Banks and other financial institutions will also benefit from the general hedge accounting model.
BCE.184 The IASB expects that most costs for preparers will be incurred at the transition date and will relate to the links that need to be created between the accounting and the risk management functions.
Under the current model for hedge accounting such links have generally been weak or non-existent, reflecting the accounting-centric character of that model.
Additional costs will be incurred in explaining to the users of financial statements the impact of the hedging activities.
This cost will, however, be mitigated by the fact that, given the greater alignment with risk management, some of the information, although not used for accounting purposes, is already being produced for risk management purposes or is being produced for the reporting of alternative performance measures (the latter often being presented on a non-GAAP basis).
In particular, the costs for the hedge effectiveness test for many hedging relationships, especially simple ones, should be reduced on an ongoing basis.
In view of the criticisms received, the IASB, instead of merely considering improvements to the existing model, decided to rethink the entire paradigm of hedge accounting.
BCE.190 The IASB decided to expand the types of eligible financial instruments under the new hedge accounting model, to allow non-derivative financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss to be designated as hedging instruments, ie to acknowledge their effect also for accounting purposes.
The IASB decided that the eligibility of an option contract to be designated as a hedging instrument should depend on its economic substance and risk management objectives instead of its legal form alone.
Consequently, the IASB decided that a stand-alone written option would be eligible for designation as a hedging instrument if it is jointly designated with other hedging instruments so that, in combination, they do not result in a net written option.
BCE.192 A key change brought about by the Standard is the ability to hedge a risk component of a non-financial item.
The IASB decided to align the treatment of financial and non-financial items to also allow the hedging of risk components in non-financial items, when they are separately identifiable and reliably measurable.
This change will enable such hedges to be reflected in the designation used for hedge accounting, thereby enabling preparers to better reflect, and users of financial statements to better understand, the actual risk management activity and the effectiveness of hedging strategies.
This created a disconnect between the accounting and the actual risk management activity.
BCE.194 Consequently, the IASB decided that groups of items (including net positions) would be eligible for hedge accounting.
In the case of foreign currency exposures this would mean that all of the actual cash flows included within the group of cash flows being hedged could be designated in line with actual risk management.
However, the IASB also decided that for cash flow hedges such net position hedging would not be available for risks other than foreign currency exposures.
However, the IASB noted that this did not prevent entities from getting hedge accounting through gross designations that are determined by the net exposure that is monitored for risk management purposes.
BCE.195 In the area of 'risk components', respondents believed that it should be possible to designate a risk component that assumes cash flows that would exceed the actual cash flows of the hedged item, as it reflects risk management in situations in which the hedged item has a negative spread to the benchmark rate.
For example, being able to designate a full LIBOR component in a financial instrument that yields LIBOR less a spread (colloquially referred to as 'sub-LIBOR').
Such respondents believed that it should be possible to hedge the LIBOR risk as a benchmark component and treat the spread as a negative residual component, as they hedged their exposure to the variability of cash flows attributable to LIBOR (or a correlated index) using LIBOR swaps.
In that context, the IASB noted that, for risk management purposes, an entity normally does not try to hedge the entire interest rate of a financial instrument but instead the change in the variability of the cash flows attributable to LIBOR.
Such a strategy protects an entity's exposure to benchmark interest rate risk and, importantly, the profit margin of the hedged items (ie the spread relative to the benchmark) is protected against LIBOR changes.
This is, of course, only feasible if LIBOR does not fall below the absolute value of the negative spread.
However, if LIBOR does fall below the absolute value of that negative spread it would result in 'negative' interest, or interest that is inconsistent with the movement of market interest rates.
Consequently, in contrast to exposures with full LIBOR variability, hedging sub-LIBOR exposures means that the entity remains exposed to cash flow variability in some situations.
The IASB noted that allowing a designation that ignores this fact would not faithfully represent the economic phenomenon.
However, hedge accounting would still be available in such situations if all the cash flows hedged for a particular risk are designated as the hedged item.
As a consequence, there was often little or no link between the analysis undertaken by risk managers who hedge the risk and the analysis required to apply hedge accounting, and as a result between the hedge accounting and risk management operations.
This was reflected, for example, in the fact that hedge accounting could be required to be discontinued in situations in which the hedging relationship was regarded as satisfactory and could be continued from a risk management perspective and for which the entity could achieve hedge accounting again — but only as a new hedging relationship.
Also, given the specified bright lines for effectiveness and the accounting consequences of deviating from the same, it made hedge accounting difficult to understand and apply.
Instead of setting quantitative thresholds or bright lines, this approach focuses on the achievement of economic offset, a concept used by risk managers when designing and implementing hedging strategies.
It also has the benefit of removing the burden of working out hedge effectiveness purely for accounting purposes and instead leverages the assessment done by risk management to ensure compliance with the hedge effectiveness requirements in the Standard.
The principles and the concepts behind this change received widespread support.
The IASB, in its deliberations, noted that this was inconsistent with risk management practices and did not represent the economic phenomenon in practice.
There are instances when, although the risk management objective remains the same, adjustments to an existing hedging relationship are made because of changes in circumstances related to the hedging relationship's underlyings or risk variables.
The IASB concluded that, in situations in which the original risk management objective remained unaltered, the adjustment to the hedging relationship should be treated as the continuation of the hedging relationship.
This will have the effect of enabling changes in risk management to be properly portrayed in hedge accounting.
Also, the entity had a free choice to discontinue hedge accounting by simply revoking the designation of the hedging relationship, irrespective of the reason behind it.
The IASB noted that, in some situations, the hedging relationship was discontinued and then restarted even though the risk management objective of the entity had not changed.
In the light of this, the IASB decided that the ability of an entity to voluntarily revoke a hedge designation, even when all qualifying criteria are met, would no longer be available.
However, if the risk management objective for the hedging relationship changes then hedge accounting needs to be discontinued.
This will improve the link with risk management by ensuring that once hedge accounting commences it will continue as long as the hedge still qualifies for hedge accounting.
The IASB did, however, note that many users of financial statements were confused by the accounting distinction made between cash flow hedges and fair value hedges and how that distinction related to risk and the strategies for managing such risks.
Consequently, the IASB decided to include new disclosure requirements in IFRS 7, whereby all disclosures for hedge accounting are presented in a single section in the financial statements with the objective of alleviating this confusion.
This meant that the time value that was not designated was required to be presented similarly to financial instruments held for trading.
This created a disconnect between the accounting treatment and the risk management view, whereby entities typically consider the time value of an option at contract inception (the premium paid) as a cost of hedging akin to a cost of buying protection (like insurance).
BCE.204 The IASB agreed that the time value of an option could be viewed as a premium paid for protection against risk and, consequently, decided to align the accounting for the time value with the risk management perspective.
The IASB took the view that, like the distinction between the different types of costs related to insuring risk, the time value of options should be similarly distinguished.
For transaction related hedged items the cumulative change in the fair value of the option's time value should be accumulated in other comprehensive income and should be reclassified in a similar way to that for cash flow hedges.
In contrast, for time-period related hedged items the nature of the time value of the option used as the hedging instrument is that of a cost for obtaining protection against a risk over a particular period of time.
BCE.205 The effect of this change is that the time value paid is treated like a cost of hedging instead of as held for trading with the resulting volatility recognised in profit or loss.
This enables the costs of such a hedging strategy to be presented in a manner that reflects the inter-relation with the hedging relationship in which the option's intrinsic value is designated, and is consistent with risk management.
It also removes a potential disincentive against the use of options as hedging instruments and improves transparency of the costs of hedging.
BCE.206 The IASB made similar changes to the accounting for the forward element of forward contracts and the foreign currency basis spread of hedging instruments.
Hedges of open positions introduce significant complexity in the accounting model as the continuous changes in the hedged item need to be monitored and tracked for accounting purposes.
The continuous changes in the hedged item also mean there is no direct one-to-one relationship with particular hedges.
BCE.208 The IASB decided not to specifically address open portfolios or the accounting for 'macro hedging' as part of the new hedge accounting model.
The IASB received feedback from financial institutions, as well as from entities outside the financial sector, that addressing situations in which entities use a dynamic risk management strategy was important.
Given the nature and complexity of the topic, the IASB has decided to separately deliberate the accounting for macro hedging with the objective of issuing a Discussion Paper.
However, so called 'proxy hedging' (when, for example, the designation for hedge accounting purposes is on a gross position basis even though actual risk management typically manages on a net position basis) is still an eligible way to designate a hedged item as long as the designation reflects risk management in that it is related to the same type of risk that is being managed and the financial instruments used for that purpose.
BCE.211 Financial institutions use credit derivatives to manage their credit risk exposures arising from their lending activities and also, on occasion, to reduce their regulatory capital requirements.
However, the credit risk of a financial item is not a risk component that meets the eligibility criteria for hedged items.
This is currently a significant issue, particularly for financial institutions because, by using derivatives to manage credit risk, an activity designed to reduce risk, volatility in profit or loss is increased, thereby creating the perception of increased risk.
BCE.212 Many respondents were of the view that the IASB should address the accounting for hedges of credit risk using credit derivatives.
Most of them also believed that this is an important issue in practice that the IASB should address.
This eliminates the accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise from measuring credit derivatives at fair value and hedged items (such as loans) at amortised cost.
It also enables entities to appropriately reflect this risk management activity in their financial statements.
By allowing entities to make this election also for a proportion of a financial instrument and after its initial recognition, and to subsequently discontinue the fair value measurement for the hedged credit exposure, this approach enables entities to reflect their risk management activity more effectively than using the fair value option (which is available only on initial recognition for the financial instrument in its entirety, and is irrevocable).
This becomes important because entities often do not hedge items for their entire life.
This targeted fair value option is also available for credit exposures that are outside the scope of this Standard, such as most loan commitments.
BCE.214 The IASB decided that by its very essence, hedge accounting should continue to be voluntary.
However, by improving the link to risk management, which in itself makes hedge accounting less burdensome to apply and facilitates a more useful reflection of risk management activities, increased use of hedge accounting should occur thus improving comparability.
The IASB decided not to allow the discontinuation of hedge accounting when an entity's risk management objective is unchanged.
This will assist in improving comparability.
The IASB decided to retain the scope of the hedge accounting disclosures because it provides, to users of financial statements, information on exposures that an entity hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied.
For this population of hedging relationships, disclosure is required that will enable users of financial statements to better understand risk management (its effects on cash flows) and the effect of hedge accounting on financial statements.
Hedge accounting has been difficult for users of financial statements to understand, which in turn has made risk management difficult to understand.
These enhanced disclosures will assist in improving the ability of users of financial statements to compare entities' risk management activities.
Better economic decision making as a result of improved financial reporting
The IASB is of the view that this fundamental shift in focus — whereby the accounting and risk management objectives are brought in congruence — will result in better economic decision making through improved financial reporting.
BCE.218 In the IASB's outreach some entities said that the accounting consequences of using options (non-linear instruments) were a consideration in their risk management activities.
This was because the undesignated time value of the option was accounted for as at fair value through profit or loss, thereby resulting in significant profit or loss volatility.
The IASB has addressed this issue and has better aligned the reported results with the risk management perspective.
Time value is now considered to be a cost of hedging instead of a trading position.
BCE.219 The IASB expects that these amendments will significantly reduce the accounting considerations affecting risk management decisions and also provide users of financial statements with more useful information about hedging activities, including the cost of such activities, resulting in better economic decision making.
The IASB noted the comments received from respondents that such a treatment enables an entity to better capture its risk management activities in its financial statements.
Entities will be able to more readily designate hedges in a manner that is consistent with risk management and to recognise hedge effectiveness on this basis.
The IASB believes that this will significantly improve the usefulness of reported information for entities hedging non-financial items, which will enable preparers to better reflect their performance and result in better economic decision making.
Instead of a percentage-based test that does not meaningfully capture the characteristics of a hedging relationship in all situations, the effectiveness of hedging relationships will be evaluated on the basis of the features that drive their economic success.
The new model will ensure that when the economics of a transaction demand that a hedge be rebalanced, such rebalancing does not lead to the hedging relationship being portrayed as discontinued.
The IASB believes that such amendments will enable the economic success of an entity's hedging programme to be reflected in the financial statements, thereby leading to better decision making by both management and users of financial statements, because they will be in a better position to make informed judgements about an entity's hedging operations.
BCE.223 The IASB's decision to require the continuation of hedge accounting when a derivative is novated to effect clearing with a central clearing party also improves the usefulness of information for users of financial statements.
This is achieved by preventing the discontinuation of hedge accounting and the ineffectiveness that would arise from a new hedging relationship being designated as a replacement.
Consequently, positions that are a combination of an exposure and a derivative (aggregated exposures) failed to qualify as hedged items.
Under the new model an aggregated exposure (comprising a derivative and non-derivative) is an eligible hedged item.
Similarly, by modifying the requirements for hedges of groups of items, the accounting for such hedges can now be better represented in the financial statements.
Again, the IASB believes that, aligning the accounting model with risk management will result in better information for economic decision making.
BCE.225 This Standard also makes changes to aspects of the accounting for financial instruments outside hedge accounting that allow risk management to be more faithfully represented in the financial statements.
Currently, those contracts are not treated as derivatives in particular circumstances (they are executory contracts that are off the statement of financial position).
This can create an artificial perspective when they are measured as part of a portfolio that includes other items that are recognised in the statement of financial position and measured at fair value through profit or loss.
By allowing entities to elect to measure own use contracts at fair value through profit or loss, entities are better able to provide information about their risk management activities in the financial statements.
The IASB believes that these changes, along with those concerning the management of credit risk, will provide better information for economic decision making.
BCE.226 As with all new requirements, the IASB acknowledges that different areas of the requirements will have different effects and hence different types of costs and benefits will arise when considering both preparers and users of financial statements.
Given that the new model is based on an entity's risk management practices, it is reasonable to conclude that one of the key drivers of the costs incurred and the benefits obtained, in complying with the new requirements, will be the level of development and the sophistication of the entities' risk management functions.
development of new processes, systems and controls to integrate information produced for risk management purposes into their accounting processes;
creating accounting capabilities for some new eligible accounting treatments (if they are intended to be used — for example, the new accounting for costs of hedging);
updating of the documentation for existing hedging relationships on transition to the new requirements;
education of accounting functions to enable them to assess whether the information prepared for risk management purposes would suffice to comply with the new hedge accounting requirements; and
the need to explain to users of financial statements the difference between the information produced for risk management purposes and the hedge accounting disclosures.
BCE.228 The IASB believes that the costs of the transition, as well as the ongoing costs of applying the new hedge accounting requirements, will very much depend on the individual circumstances of each entity — for example, what type of hedging instruments and hedged items it has, what types of hedges it uses, and how it has implemented hedge accounting in terms of processes and systems.
It is therefore difficult to generalise the likely impact of costs on preparers.
Entities using bespoke or self-developed solutions are affected differently from those using standard software.
Costs arise on transition when the capability to provide those disclosures is created but will also include ongoing costs.
However, if entities embed this in their systems that they use for preparing their financial statements the ongoing costs can be significantly reduced.
BCE.229 Overall, given the fact that the new model developed by the IASB is more aligned with the day-to-day risk management activities of an entity, the IASB believes that the following benefits will outweigh the costs of initial implementation and on-going application
better consistency between accounting and risk management;
less need for non-GAAP information to explain to users of financial statements the impact of hedging for which hedge accounting was not achieved;
standardised and more transparent information, resulting in a better understanding of the company's hedging performance.
Under the new model, linking the hedge documentation requirements with that of risk management systems will, in the IASB's view, bring in efficiencies and cost savings as entities integrate such systems.
In addition, the new model includes an objective-based effectiveness assessment, which is linked to the way that the hedging relationship is designed and monitored for risk management purposes.
BCE.231 This will be further reinforced by the fact that the IASB, after due consideration, decided to keep the mechanics of hedge accounting for fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges the same. This will avoid any major costs involved with changing accounting systems both on initial application and on an ongoing basis.
BCE.232 One of the costs involved with the application of any new Standard is the cost of developing ways to implement it.
In response, the IASB has provided detailed guidance whenever possible (for example, detail about the accounting mechanics for aggregated exposures).
The IASB believes that this will help in reducing both the initial and ongoing cost of compliance.
This means that those who do not want to change their accounting for macro hedging need not do so until completion of the project on the accounting for macro hedging.
This is because the new hedge accounting model does not change how risk components of financial items can be designated as hedged items.
Entities would need to update their documentation of their hedging relationships to reflect the new effectiveness assessment.
However, if hedge accounting was applied under IAS 39, the sources of ineffectiveness should be known, and it should be possible to update documentation efficiently by using a master document approach for similar hedges.
Costs of analysis for users of financial statements
Consequently, from the perspective of users of financial statements, the costs in educating themselves about these proposals will be reduced.
BCE.236 The IASB also decided that it would require comprehensive information to be disclosed so that users of financial statements could understand the effects of hedge accounting on the financial statements and so that all hedge accounting disclosures are presented in a single note in the financial statements.
This will enable users to access a set of information that is more relevant to their needs and will therefore reduce the need to rely on information prepared on a non-GAAP basis.
In addition, they will also benefit from more meaningful information that is more closely linked to the decision making for risk management purposes.
This will allow them to better form their own view of the entity's risk management and its effect on reported results.
The opportunity for more extensive analyses would, of course, entail costs of performing those analyses, as with any use of financial reporting information.
In addition, because risk management can be better reflected, and as a result of enhanced disclosures, more relevant and transparent information will be provided to users of financial statements.
It states that both classification conditions are essential to ensure that amortised cost provides useful information.
If that treatment would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss, the entire fair value change is presented in profit or loss.
That approach requires the effects of changes in a liability's credit risk to be presented directly in other comprehensive income, with the remaining amount of fair value change presented in profit or loss.
The effects of changes in a liability's credit risk would have been backed out and presented in other comprehensive income.
In this Basis for Conclusions, monetary amounts are denominated in 'currency units (CU)'.
Unless the financial asset is a trade receivable that does not have a significant financing component (determined in accordance with IFRS 15).
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income only if both conditions in paragraph 4.1.2 or paragraph 4.1.2A of IFRS 9, respectively, are met.
Accordingly, this section does not discuss the conditions in paragraphs 4.1.2(a) and 4.1.2A(a) relating to the business model but instead assumes that the asset is held in the relevant business model.
As a result, IFRS and US GAAP have different requirements for when an entity may recognise a gain or loss when there is a difference between fair value and the transaction price at initial recognition.
As a consequence minor necessary edits have been made to that material.
Paragraph B5.4.6 does not apply to changes in estimates of expected credit losses.
The IASB will consider the accounting consequences of the actual amendment of financial instruments as a result of interest rate benchmark reform in the next phase of this project (ie the replacement phase).
The fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category is available only for debt instruments.
This applies unless that treatment would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss, in which case all changes in fair value are presented in profit or loss.
Sales do not contradict the hold to collect business model if they are in response to the increase in the instrument's credit risk.
The portfolios excluded derivatives and financial guarantee contracts to make the calculations easier and to help participants meet the short deadline of the fieldwork.
Participants were provided a series of economic information so their proxy forecasting was more accurate than it would be in reality.
Although this assessment has imperfections, it nevertheless provided an estimate of the responsiveness of the impairment model.
The difference in percentages reflect the extreme effects of differences in expected lives between jurisdictions.
qualitative feedback due to timing requirements of the fieldwork; or
the simplified approach (ie measured lifetime expected credit losses on all financial assets) or an absolute approach (for example, when lifetime expected credit losses were recognised on all financial assets of higher credit risk irrespective of whether the credit risk had increased significantly since initial recognition).
Some of the participants in the fieldwork confirmed that this is a more practical way to implement the assessment of significant increases in credit risk for financial instruments, thus making the impairment model more operational.
During the fieldwork, some participants were initially concerned that the assessment of significant increases in credit risk is not based on changes in the counterparty's credit risk.
However, over the course of the fieldwork, a number of those participants found ways to deal with the difference between the change in the counterparty credit risk and the change in the credit risk of the instrument since origination and stated this to be no longer an area of concern.
The non-financial institutions that participated in the fieldwork supported the accounting policy election for lease receivables.
They applied the simplified approach because
the assets in the portfolio were short term in nature; and
the simplified approach fitted better into their current credit risk systems, which were not sophisticated systems.
Consequential amendments to other IFRS Standards are included with the amendment, revision or new IFRS Standard to which they relate.
Unless otherwise indicated, earlier application is permitted.
Generally, entities choosing to apply an amendment, a revision or a new IFRS Standard before its effective date are required to also apply the related consequential amendments at the same time.

However, an entity need not duplicate information that is already presented elsewhere, provided that the information is incorporated by cross-reference from the financial statements to some other statement, such as a management commentary or risk report, that is available to users of the financial statements on the same terms as the financial statements and at the same time.
An entity shall determine risk categories consistently for all hedge accounting disclosures.
An entity shall explain its risk management strategy for each risk category of risk exposures that it decides to hedge and for which hedge accounting is applied.
This explanation should enable users of financial statements to evaluate (for example)
the extent of risk exposures that the entity manages.
To meet the requirements in paragraph 22A, the information should include (but is not limited to) a description of
the hedging instruments that are used (and how they are used) to hedge risk exposures;
how the entity determines the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument for the purpose of assessing hedge effectiveness; and
how the entity establishes the hedge ratio and what the sources of hedge ineffectiveness are.
how the entity determined the risk component that is designated as the hedged item (including a description of the nature of the relationship between the risk component and the item as a whole); and
Unless exempted by paragraph 23C, an entity shall disclose by risk category quantitative information to allow users of its financial statements to evaluate the terms and conditions of hedging instruments and how they affect the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows of the entity.
To meet the requirement in paragraph 23A, an entity shall provide a breakdown that discloses
a profile of the timing of the nominal amount of the hedging instrument; and
if applicable, the average price or rate (for example strike or forward prices etc) of the hedging instrument.
information about what the ultimate risk management strategy is in relation to those hedging relationships;
a description of how it reflects its risk management strategy by using hedge accounting and designating those particular hedging relationships; and
An entity shall disclose by risk category a description of the sources of hedge ineffectiveness that are expected to affect the hedging relationship during its term.
If other sources of hedge ineffectiveness emerge in a hedging relationship, an entity shall disclose those sources by risk category and explain the resulting hedge ineffectiveness.
For cash flow hedges, an entity shall disclose a description of any forecast transaction for which hedge accounting had been used in the previous period, but which is no longer expected to occur.
An entity shall disclose, in a tabular format, the following amounts related to items designated as hedging instruments separately by risk category for each type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation)
the carrying amount of the hedging instruments (financial assets separately from financial liabilities);
the line item in the statement of financial position that includes the hedging instrument;
the change in fair value of the hedging instrument used as the basis for recognising hedge ineffectiveness for the period; and
An entity shall disclose, in a tabular format, the following amounts related to hedged items separately by risk category for the types of hedges as follows
the carrying amount of the hedged item recognised in the statement of financial position (presenting assets separately from liabilities);
the accumulated amount of fair value hedge adjustments on the hedged item included in the carrying amount of the hedged item recognised in the statement of financial position (presenting assets separately from liabilities);
(iii) the line item in the statement of financial position that includes the hedged item;
(iv) the change in value of the hedged item used as the basis for recognising hedge ineffectiveness for the period; and
for cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation

An entity shall disclose, in a tabular format, the following amounts separately by risk category for the types of hedges as follows
the line item in the statement of comprehensive income that includes the recognised hedge ineffectiveness.
hedging gains or losses of the reporting period that were recognised in other comprehensive income;
hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss;
(iii) the line item in the statement of comprehensive income that includes the recognised hedge ineffectiveness;
(iv) the amount reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve or the foreign currency translation reserve into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1) (differentiating between amounts for which hedge accounting had previously been used, but for which the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, and amounts that have been transferred because the hedged item has affected profit or loss);
the line item in the statement of comprehensive income that includes the reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1); and
When the volume of hedging relationships to which the exemption in paragraph 23C applies is unrepresentative of normal volumes during the period (ie the volume at the reporting date does not reflect the volumes during the period) an entity shall disclose that fact and the reason it believes the volumes are unrepresentative.
This disaggregation by risk may be provided in the notes to the financial statements.
the significant interest rate benchmarks to which the entity's hedging relationships are exposed;
the extent of the risk exposure the entity manages that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform;
how the entity is managing the process to transition to alternative benchmark rates;

the nominal amount of the hedging instruments in those hedging relationships.
In such cases, the entity shall disclose by class of financial asset or financial liability
its accounting policy for recognising in profit or loss the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price to reflect a change in factors (including time) that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability (see paragraph B5.1.2A(b) of IFRS 9).
the aggregate difference yet to be recognised in profit or loss at the beginning and end of the period and a reconciliation of changes in the balance of this difference.
why the entity concluded that the transaction price was not the best evidence of fair value, including a description of the evidence that supports the fair value.

the fact that fair value information has not been disclosed for these instruments because their fair value cannot be measured reliably;
a description of the financial instruments, their carrying amount, and an explanation of why fair value cannot be measured reliably;
information about the market for the instruments;
information about whether and how the entity intends to dispose of the financial instruments; and
if financial instruments whose fair value previously could not be reliably measured are derecognised, that fact, their carrying amount at the time of derecognition, and the amount of gain or loss recognised.
Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments
These risks typically include, but are not limited to, credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The interaction between qualitative and quantitative disclosures contributes to disclosure of information in a way that better enables users to evaluate an entity's exposure to risks.
the exposures to risk and how they arise;
its objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk; and
summary quantitative data about its exposure to that risk at the end of the reporting period.
concentrations of risk if not apparent from the disclosures made in accordance with (a) and (b).
To achieve this objective, credit risk disclosures shall provide
information about an entity's credit risk management practices and how they relate to the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses, including the methods, assumptions and information used to measure expected credit losses;
information about an entity's credit risk exposure (ie the credit risk inherent in an entity's financial assets and commitments to extend credit) including significant credit risk concentrations.
An entity need not duplicate information that is already presented elsewhere, provided that the information is incorporated by cross-reference from the financial statements to other statements, such as a management commentary or risk report that is available to users of the financial statements on the same terms as the financial statements and at the same time.
To meet the objectives in paragraph 35B, an entity shall (except as otherwise specified) consider how much detail to disclose, how much emphasis to place on different aspects of the disclosure requirements, the appropriate level of aggregation or disaggregation, and whether users of financial statements need additional explanations to evaluate the quantitative information disclosed.
An entity shall explain its credit risk management practices and how they relate to the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses.
To meet this objective an entity shall disclose information that enables users of financial statements to understand and evaluate
how an entity determined whether the credit risk of financial instruments has increased significantly since initial recognition, including, if and how
financial instruments are considered to have low credit risk in accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9, including the classes of financial instruments to which it applies; and
an entity's definitions of default, including the reasons for selecting those definitions;
how the instruments were grouped if expected credit losses were measured on a collective basis;
how an entity determined that financial assets are credit-impaired financial assets;
an entity's write-off policy, including the indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery and information about the policy for financial assets that are written off but are still subject to enforcement activity; and
For this purpose an entity shall disclose
the basis of inputs and assumptions and the estimation techniques used to
determine whether the credit risk of financial instruments has increased significantly since initial recognition; and
(iii) determine whether a financial asset is a credit-impaired financial asset.
how forward-looking information has been incorporated into the determination of expected credit losses, including the use of macroeconomic information; and
changes in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the reporting period and the reasons for those changes.
To explain the changes in the loss allowance and the reasons for those changes, an entity shall provide, by class of financial instrument, a reconciliation from the opening balance to the closing balance of the loss allowance, in a table, showing separately the changes during the period for
the loss allowance measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for
financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired.
In addition to the reconciliation, an entity shall disclose the total amount of undiscounted expected credit losses at initial recognition on financial assets initially recognised during the reporting period.
To enable users of financial statements to understand the changes in the loss allowance disclosed in accordance with paragraph 35H, an entity shall provide an explanation of how significant changes in the gross carrying amount of financial instruments during the period contributed to changes in the loss allowance.
The information shall be provided separately for financial instruments that represent the loss allowance as listed in paragraph 35H(a)–(c) and shall include relevant qualitative and quantitative information.
Examples of changes in the gross carrying amount of financial instruments that contributed to the changes in the loss allowance may include
changes because of financial instruments originated or acquired during the reporting period;
changes because of financial instruments that were derecognised (including those that were written off) during the reporting period; and
To enable users of financial statements to understand the nature and effect of modifications of contractual cash flows on financial assets that have not resulted in derecognition and the effect of such modifications on the measurement of expected credit losses, an entity shall disclose
the amortised cost before the modification and the net modification gain or loss recognised for financial assets for which the contractual cash flows have been modified during the reporting period while they had a loss allowance measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses; and
To enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of collateral and other credit enhancements on the amounts arising from expected credit losses, an entity shall disclose by class of financial instrument
the amount that best represents its maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements (eg netting agreements that do not qualify for offset in accordance with IAS 32).
a narrative description of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements, including
a description of the nature and quality of the collateral held;
an explanation of any significant changes in the quality of that collateral or credit enhancements as a result of deterioration or changes in the collateral policies of the entity during the reporting period; and
(iii) information about financial instruments for which an entity has not recognised a loss allowance because of the collateral.
quantitative information about the collateral held as security and other credit enhancements (for example, quantification of the extent to which collateral and other credit enhancements mitigate credit risk) for financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date.
An entity shall disclose the contractual amount outstanding on financial assets that were written off during the reporting period and are still subject to enforcement activity.
To enable users of financial statements to assess an entity's credit risk exposure and understand its significant credit risk concentrations, an entity shall disclose, by credit risk rating grades, the gross carrying amount of financial assets and the exposure to credit risk on loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
This information shall be provided separately for financial instruments
for which the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses and that are
that are purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets.

An entity shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements
to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, the entity's continuing involvement in derecognised financial assets.
For the purposes of applying the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 42E–42H, an entity has continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if, as part of the transfer, the entity retains any of the contractual rights or obligations inherent in the transferred financial asset or obtains any new contractual rights or obligations relating to the transferred financial asset.

The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer or by factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market.
gross carrying amount of a financial asset
purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets
regular way purchase or sale.
Classes of financial instruments and level of disclosure (paragraph 6)
In determining classes of financial instrument, an entity shall, at a minimum
distinguish instruments measured at amortised cost from those measured at fair value.
treat as a separate class or classes those financial instruments outside the scope of this IFRS.
An entity decides, in the light of its circumstances, how much detail it provides to satisfy the requirements of this IFRS, how much emphasis it places on different aspects of the requirements and how it aggregates information to display the overall picture without combining information with different characteristics.
It is necessary to strike a balance between overburdening financial statements with excessive detail that may not assist users of financial statements and obscuring important information as a result of too much aggregation.
For example, an entity shall not obscure important information by including it among a large amount of insignificant detail.
Similarly, an entity shall not disclose information that is so aggregated that it obscures important differences between individual transactions or associated risks.
For financial instruments, such disclosure may include
for financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss
the nature of the financial liabilities the entity has designated as at fair value through profit or loss;
the criteria for so designating such financial liabilities on initial recognition; and
(aa) for financial assets designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss
the nature of the financial assets the entity has designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss; and
Paragraph 34(a) requires disclosures of summary quantitative data about an entity's exposure to risks based on the information provided internally to key management personnel of the entity.
When an entity uses several methods to manage a risk exposure, the entity shall disclose information using the method or methods that provide the most relevant and reliable information.
Paragraph 34(c) requires disclosures about concentrations of risk.
Concentrations of risk arise from financial instruments that have similar characteristics and are affected similarly by changes in economic or other conditions.
The identification of concentrations of risk requires judgement taking into account the circumstances of the entity.
Disclosure of concentrations of risk shall include
a description of how management determines concentrations;
a description of the shared characteristic that identifies each concentration (eg counterparty, geographical area, currency or market); and
the amount of the risk exposure associated with all financial instruments sharing that characteristic.
Paragraph 35F(b) requires the disclosure of information about how an entity has defined default for different financial instruments and the reasons for selecting those definitions.
the qualitative and quantitative factors considered in defining default;
whether different definitions have been applied to different types of financial instruments; and
assumptions about the cure rate (ie the number of financial assets that return to a performing status) after a default occurred on the financial asset.
Quantitative information that will assist users in understanding the subsequent increase in credit risk of modified financial assets may include information about modified financial assets meeting the criteria in paragraph 35F(f)(i) for which the loss allowance has reverted to being measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (ie a deterioration rate).
An entity's assumptions and inputs used to measure expected credit losses or determine the extent of increases in credit risk since initial recognition may include information obtained from internal historical information or rating reports and assumptions about the expected life of financial instruments and the timing of the sale of collateral.
Changes in the loss allowance (paragraph 35H)
In accordance with paragraph 35H, an entity is required to explain the reasons for the changes in the loss allowance during the period.
In addition to the reconciliation from the opening balance to the closing balance of the loss allowance, it may be necessary to provide a narrative explanation of the changes.
This narrative explanation may include an analysis of the reasons for changes in the loss allowance during the period, including
the volume of financial instruments purchased or originated; and
the severity of the expected credit losses.
For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts the loss allowance is recognised as a provision.
An entity should disclose information about the changes in the loss allowance for financial assets separately from those for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
However, if a financial instrument includes both a loan (ie financial asset) and an undrawn commitment (ie loan commitment) component and the entity cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the loan commitment component from those on the financial asset component, the expected credit losses on the loan commitment should be recognised together with the loss allowance for the financial asset.
To the extent that the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, the expected credit losses should be recognised as a provision.
An entity is neither required to disclose information about the fair value of collateral and other credit enhancements nor is it required to quantify the exact value of the collateral that was included in the calculation of expected credit losses (ie the loss given default).
A narrative description of collateral and its effect on amounts of expected credit losses might include information about
the main types of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements (examples of the latter being guarantees, credit derivatives and netting agreements that do not qualify for offset in accordance with IAS 32);
the volume of collateral held and other credit enhancements and its significance in terms of the loss allowance;
the policies and processes for valuing and managing collateral and other credit enhancements;
the main types of counterparties to collateral and other credit enhancements and their creditworthiness; and
information about risk concentrations within the collateral and other credit enhancements.
A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are located in a geographical region or are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
An entity should provide information that enables users of financial statements to understand whether there are groups or portfolios of financial instruments with particular features that could affect a large portion of that group of financial instruments such as concentration to particular risks.
This could include, for example, loan-to-value groupings, geographical, industry or issuer-type concentrations.
If past due information is the only borrower-specific information available and an entity uses past due information to assess whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition in accordance with paragraph 5.5.11 of IFRS 9, an entity shall provide an analysis by past due status for those financial assets.
When an entity has measured expected credit losses on a collective basis, the entity may not be able to allocate the gross carrying amount of individual financial assets or the exposure to credit risk on loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts to the credit risk rating grades for which lifetime expected credit losses are recognised.
Maximum credit risk exposure (paragraph 36(a))
For a financial asset, this is typically the gross carrying amount, net of
granting loans to customers and placing deposits with other entities.
In these cases, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the related financial assets.
entering into derivative contracts, eg foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and credit derivatives.
When the resulting asset is measured at fair value, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period will equal the carrying amount.
In this case, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the entity could have to pay if the guarantee is called on, which may be significantly greater than the amount recognised as a liability.
making a loan commitment that is irrevocable over the life of the facility or is revocable only in response to a material adverse change.
If the issuer cannot settle the loan commitment net in cash or another financial instrument, the maximum credit exposure is the full amount of the commitment.
This is because it is uncertain whether the amount of any undrawn portion may be drawn upon in the future.
This may be significantly greater than the amount recognised as a liability.
In accordance with paragraph 34(a) an entity discloses summary quantitative data about its exposure to liquidity risk on the basis of the information provided internally to key management personnel.
An entity shall explain how those data are determined.
If the outflows of cash (or another financial asset) included in those data could either
occur significantly earlier than indicated in the data, or
be for significantly different amounts from those indicated in the data (eg for a derivative that is included in the data on a net settlement basis but for which the counterparty has the option to require gross settlement)
the entity shall state that fact and provide quantitative information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the extent of this risk unless that information is included in the contractual maturity analyses required by paragraph 39(a) or (b).
In preparing the maturity analyses required by paragraph 39(a) and (b) an entity uses its judgement to determine an appropriate number of time bands.
For example, an entity might determine that the following time bands are appropriate
In complying with paragraph 39(a) and (b), an entity shall not separate an embedded derivative from a hybrid (combined) financial instrument.
For such an instrument, an entity shall apply paragraph 39(a).
Paragraph 39(b) requires an entity to disclose a quantitative maturity analysis for derivative financial liabilities that shows remaining contractual maturities if the contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows.
For example, this would be the case for
Paragraph 39(a) and (b) requires an entity to disclose maturity analyses for financial liabilities that show the remaining contractual maturities for some financial liabilities.
when a counterparty has a choice of when an amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which the entity can be required to pay.
For example, financial liabilities that an entity can be required to repay on demand (eg demand deposits) are included in the earliest time band.
when an entity is committed to make amounts available in instalments, each instalment is allocated to the earliest period in which the entity can be required to pay.
For example, an undrawn loan commitment is included in the time band containing the earliest date it can be drawn down.
for issued financial guarantee contracts the maximum amount of the guarantee is allocated to the earliest period in which the guarantee could be called.
The contractual amounts disclosed in the maturity analyses as required by paragraph 39(a) and (b) are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, for example
gross lease liabilities (before deducting finance charges);
prices specified in forward agreements to purchase financial assets for cash;
net amounts for pay-floating / receive-fixed interest rate swaps for which net cash flows are exchanged;
Such undiscounted cash flows differ from the amount included in the statement of financial position because the amount in that statement is based on discounted cash flows.
When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period.
For example, when the amount payable varies with changes in an index, the amount disclosed may be based on the level of the index at the end of the period.
Paragraph 39(c) requires an entity to describe how it manages the liquidity risk inherent in the items disclosed in the quantitative disclosures required in paragraph 39(a) and (b).
An entity shall disclose a maturity analysis of financial assets it holds for managing liquidity risk (eg financial assets that are readily saleable or expected to generate cash inflows to meet cash outflows on financial liabilities), if that information is necessary to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk.
Other factors that an entity might consider in providing the disclosure required in paragraph 39(c) include, but are not limited to, whether the entity
holds deposits at central banks to meet liquidity needs;
has very diverse funding sources;
has significant concentrations of liquidity risk in either its assets or its funding sources;
has internal control processes and contingency plans for managing liquidity risk;
has instruments that include accelerated repayment terms (eg on the downgrade of the entity's credit rating);
has instruments that could require the posting of collateral (eg margin calls for derivatives);
has instruments that are subject to master netting agreements.
Paragraph 40(a) requires a sensitivity analysis for each type of market risk to which the entity is exposed.
In accordance with paragraph B3, an entity decides how it aggregates information to display the overall picture without combining information with different characteristics about exposures to risks from significantly different economic environments.
an entity that trades financial instruments might disclose this information separately for financial instruments held for trading and those not held for trading.
an entity would not aggregate its exposure to market risks from areas of hyperinflation with its exposure to the same market risks from areas of very low inflation.
Paragraph 40(a) requires the sensitivity analysis to show the effect on profit or loss and equity of reasonably possible changes in the relevant risk variable (eg prevailing market interest rates, currency rates, equity prices or commodity prices).
entities are not required to determine what the profit or loss for the period would have been if relevant risk variables had been different.
Instead, entities disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity at the end of the reporting period assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable had occurred at the end of the reporting period and had been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date.
entities are not required to disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity for each change within a range of reasonably possible changes of the relevant risk variable.
Disclosure of the effects of the changes at the limits of the reasonably possible range would be sufficient.
In determining what a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable is, an entity should consider
the economic environments in which it operates.
A reasonably possible change should not include remote or 'worst case' scenarios or 'stress tests'.
Moreover, if the rate of change in the underlying risk variable is stable, the entity need not alter the chosen reasonably possible change in the risk variable.
The entity continues to believe that interest rates may fluctuate by ±50 basis points (ie that the rate of change in interest rates is stable).
The entity would not be required to revise its assessment that interest rates might reasonably fluctuate by ±50 basis points, unless there is evidence that interest rates have become significantly more volatile.
the time frame over which it is making the assessment.
This applies even if such a methodology measures only the potential for loss and does not measure the potential for gain.
Such an entity might comply with paragraph 41(a) by disclosing the type of value-at-risk model used (eg whether the model relies on Monte Carlo simulations), an explanation about how the model works and the main assumptions (eg the holding period and confidence level).
Entities might also disclose the historical observation period and weightings applied to observations within that period, an explanation of how options are dealt with in the calculations, and which volatilities and correlations (or, alternatively, Monte Carlo probability distribution simulations) are used.
An entity shall provide sensitivity analyses for the whole of its business, but may provide different types of sensitivity analysis for different classes of financial instruments.
Interest rate risk arises on interest-bearing financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position (eg debt instruments acquired or issued) and on some financial instruments not recognised in the statement of financial position (eg some loan commitments).
A sensitivity analysis is disclosed for each currency to which an entity has significant exposure.
Other price risk arises on financial instruments because of changes in, for example, commodity prices or equity prices.
For example, if an entity gives residual value guarantees that are financial instruments, the entity discloses an increase or decrease in the value of the assets to which the guarantee applies.
Other examples include forward contracts and options to buy or sell specified quantities of an equity instrument and swaps that are indexed to equity prices.
The fair values of such financial instruments are affected by changes in the market price of the underlying equity instruments.
In accordance with paragraph 40(a), the sensitivity of profit or loss (that arises, for example, from instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss) is disclosed separately from the sensitivity of other comprehensive income (that arises, for example, from investments in equity instruments whose changes in fair value are presented in other comprehensive income).
Financial instruments that an entity classifies as equity instruments are not remeasured.
Neither profit or loss nor equity will be affected by the equity price risk of those instruments.
Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is required.
The assessment of continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset for the purposes of the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 42E–42H is made at the level of the reporting entity.
However, a parent would include its continuing involvement (or that of another member of the group) in a financial asset transferred by its subsidiary in determining whether it has continuing involvement in the transferred asset in its consolidated financial statements (ie when the reporting entity is the group).
An entity does not have a continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if, as part of the transfer, it neither retains any of the contractual rights or obligations inherent in the transferred financial asset nor acquires any new contractual rights or obligations relating to the transferred financial asset.
An entity does not have continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if it has neither an interest in the future performance of the transferred financial asset nor a responsibility under any circumstances to make payments in respect of the transferred financial asset in the future.
The term 'payment' in this context does not include cash flows of the transferred financial asset that an entity collects and is required to remit to the transferee.
When an entity transfers a financial asset, the entity may retain the right to service that financial asset for a fee that is included in, for example, a servicing contract.
The entity assesses the servicing contract in accordance with the guidance in paragraphs 42C and B30 to decide whether the entity has continuing involvement as a result of the servicing contract for the purposes of the disclosure requirements.
For example, a servicer will have continuing involvement in the transferred financial asset for the purposes of the disclosure requirements if the servicing fee is dependent on the amount or timing of the cash flows collected from the transferred financial asset.
Similarly, a servicer has continuing involvement for the purposes of the disclosure requirements if a fixed fee would not be paid in full because of non-performance of the transferred financial asset.
In these examples, the servicer has an interest in the future performance of the transferred financial asset.
This assessment is independent of whether the fee to be received is expected to compensate the entity adequately for performing the servicing.
Paragraph 42D requires disclosures when part or all of the transferred financial assets do not qualify for derecognition.
Those disclosures are required at each reporting date at which the entity continues to recognise the transferred financial assets, regardless of when the transfers occurred.
Types of continuing involvement (paragraphs 42E–42H)
An entity shall aggregate its continuing involvement into types that are representative of the entity's exposure to risks.
For example, an entity may aggregate its continuing involvement by type of financial instrument (eg guarantees or call options) or by type of transfer (eg factoring of receivables, securitisations and securities lending).
Maturity analysis for undiscounted cash outflows to repurchase transferred assets (paragraph 42E(e))
Paragraph 42E(e) requires an entity to disclose a maturity analysis of the undiscounted cash outflows to repurchase derecognised financial assets or other amounts payable to the transferee in respect of the derecognised financial assets, showing the remaining contractual maturities of the entity's continuing involvement.
This analysis distinguishes cash flows that are required to be paid (eg forward contracts), cash flows that the entity may be required to pay (eg written put options) and cash flows that the entity might choose to pay (eg purchased call options).
An entity shall use its judgement to determine an appropriate number of time bands in preparing the maturity analysis required by paragraph 42E(e).
For example, an entity might determine that the following maturity time bands are appropriate
If there is a range of possible maturities, the cash flows are included on the basis of the earliest date on which the entity can be required or is permitted to pay.
It also includes a description of the risks to which an entity is exposed, including
a description of how the entity manages the risk inherent in its continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets.
whether the entity is required to bear losses before other parties, and the ranking and amounts of losses borne by parties whose interests rank lower than the entity's interest in the asset (ie its continuing involvement in the asset).
a description of any triggers associated with obligations to provide financial support or to repurchase a transferred financial asset.
Gain or loss on derecognition (paragraph 42G(a))
Paragraph 42G(a) requires an entity to disclose the gain or loss on derecognition relating to financial assets in which the entity has continuing involvement.
The entity shall disclose if a gain or loss on derecognition arose because the fair values of the components of the previously recognised asset (ie the interest in the asset derecognised and the interest retained by the entity) were different from the fair value of the previously recognised asset as a whole.
If this is the case, the entity shall disclose whatever additional information is necessary to meet the disclosure objectives.
The entity shall decide, in the light of its circumstances, how much additional information it needs to provide to satisfy the information needs of users and how much emphasis it places on different aspects of the additional information.
It is necessary to strike a balance between burdening financial statements with excessive detail that may not assist users of financial statements and obscuring information as a result of too much aggregation.
The similar financial instruments and transactions referred to in paragraph B40 include derivatives, sale and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, and securities lending agreements.
Disclosure of quantitative information for recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities within the scope of paragraph 13A (paragraph 13C)
Financial instruments disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C may be subject to different measurement requirements (for example, a payable related to a repurchase agreement may be measured at amortised cost, while a derivative will be measured at fair value).
An entity shall include instruments at their recognised amounts and describe any resulting measurement differences in the related disclosures.
Disclosure of the gross amounts of recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities within the scope of paragraph 13A (paragraph 13C(a))
Instead, such amounts are required to be disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C(d).
The amounts of both the recognised financial assets and the recognised financial liabilities that are subject to set-off under the same arrangement will be disclosed in both the financial asset and financial liability disclosures.
However, the amounts disclosed (in, for example, a table) are limited to the amounts that are subject to set-off.
If the gross amount of the derivative asset is larger than the gross amount of the derivative liability, the financial asset disclosure table will include the entire amount of the derivative asset (in accordance with paragraph 13C(a)) and the entire amount of the derivative liability (in accordance with paragraph 13C(b)).
However, while the financial liability disclosure table will include the entire amount of the derivative liability (in accordance with paragraph 13C(a)), it will only include the amount of the derivative asset (in accordance with paragraph 13C(b)) that is equal to the amount of the derivative liability.
Disclosure of the net amounts presented in the statement of financial position (paragraph 13C(c))
The amounts required to be disclosed by paragraph 13C(c) must be reconciled to the individual line item amounts presented in the statement of financial position.
For example, if an entity determines that the aggregation or disaggregation of individual financial statement line item amounts provides more relevant information, it must reconcile the aggregated or disaggregated amounts disclosed in paragraph 13C(c) back to the individual line item amounts presented in the statement of financial position.
Paragraph 13C(d) requires that entities disclose amounts that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement that are not otherwise included in paragraph 13C(b).
Paragraph 13C(d)(ii) refers to amounts related to financial collateral, including cash collateral, both received and pledged.
An entity shall disclose the fair value of those financial instruments that have been pledged or received as collateral.
The amounts disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C(d)(ii) should relate to the actual collateral received or pledged and not to any resulting payables or receivables recognised to return or receive back such collateral.
The entity shall then limit the amounts disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C(d)(ii) to the remaining amount in paragraph 13C(c) for the related financial instrument.
However, if rights to collateral can be enforced across financial instruments, such rights can be included in the disclosure provided in accordance with paragraph 13D.
Description of the rights of set-off subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements (paragraph 13E)
An entity shall describe the types of rights of set-off and similar arrangements disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C(d), including the nature of those rights.
For example, an entity shall describe its conditional rights.
Disclosure by type of financial instrument or by counterparty
The quantitative disclosures required by paragraph 13C(a)–(e) may be grouped by type of financial instrument or transaction (for example, derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowing and securities lending agreements).
Alternatively, an entity may group the quantitative disclosures required by paragraph 13C(a)–(c) by type of financial instrument, and the quantitative disclosures required by paragraph 13C(c)–(e) by counterparty.
If an entity provides the required information by counterparty, the entity is not required to identify the counterparties by name.
Qualitative disclosures shall be considered so that further information can be given about the types of counterparties.
The specific disclosures required by paragraphs 13C–13E are minimum requirements.
To meet the objective in paragraph 13B an entity may need to supplement them with additional (qualitative) disclosures, depending on the terms of the enforceable master netting arrangements and related agreements, including the nature of the rights of set-off, and their effect or potential effect on the entity's financial position.
liabilities arising from participating in a specific market — waste electrical and electronic equipment
The Directive distinguishes between 'new' and 'historical' waste and between waste from private households and waste from sources other than private households.
All household equipment sold before that date is deemed to give rise to historical waste for the purposes of the Directive.
The Directive states that each Member State shall establish a mechanism to have producers contribute to costs proportionately 'e.g. in proportion to their respective share of the market by type of equipment.
Similarly, the measurement of market share and the formulae for computing the obligation may differ in the various national legislations.
However, all of these examples affect only the measurement of the liability, which is not within the scope of the Interpretation.
the manufacture or sale of the historical household equipment?
participation in the market during the measurement period?
the incurrence of costs in the performance of waste management activities?
As a consequence, a liability for waste management costs for historical household equipment does not arise as the products are manufactured or sold.
Because the obligation for historical household equipment is linked to participation in the market during the measurement period, rather than to production or sale of the items to be disposed of, there is no obligation unless and until a market share exists during the measurement period.
The timing of the obligating event may also be independent of the particular period in which the activities to perform the waste management are undertaken and the related costs incurred.
extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments
These transactions are sometimes referred to as 'debt for equity swaps'.
The IFRIC has received requests for guidance on the accounting for such transactions.
It does not address the accounting by the creditor.
the creditor is also a direct or indirect shareholder and is acting in its capacity as a direct or indirect existing shareholder.
the creditor and the entity are controlled by the same party or parties before and after the transaction and the substance of the transaction includes an equity distribution by, or contribution to, the entity.
extinguishing the financial liability by issuing equity shares is in accordance with the original terms of the financial liability.
If part of the consideration paid does relate to a modification of the terms of the remaining part of the liability, the entity shall allocate the consideration paid between the part of the liability extinguished and the part of the liability that remains outstanding.
The entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the transaction in making this allocation.
The equity instruments issued shall be recognised initially and measured at the date the financial liability (or part of that liability) is extinguished.
The consideration allocated to the remaining liability shall form part of the assessment of whether the terms of that remaining liability have been substantially modified.
Additional disclosures related to interest rate benchmark reform
To enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of interest rate benchmark reform on an entity's financial instruments and risk management strategy, an entity shall disclose information about
the nature and extent of risks to which the entity is exposed arising from financial instruments subject to interest rate benchmark reform, and how the entity manages these risks; and
the entity's progress in completing the transition to alternative benchmark rates, and how the entity is managing the transition.
To meet the objectives in paragraph 24I, an entity shall disclose
how the entity is managing the transition to alternative benchmark rates, its progress at the reporting date and the risks to which it is exposed arising from financial instruments because of the transition;
disaggregated by significant interest rate benchmark subject to interest rate benchmark reform, quantitative information about financial instruments that have yet to transition to an alternative benchmark rate as at the end of the reporting period, showing separately
if the risks identified in paragraph 24J(a) have resulted in changes to an entity's risk management strategy (see paragraph 22A), a description of these changes.
identifying related party relationships and transactions;
identifying outstanding balances, including commitments, between an entity and its related parties;
determining the disclosures to be made about those items.
This Standard also applies to individual financial statements.
Intragroup related party transactions and outstanding balances are eliminated, except for those between an investment entity and its subsidiaries measured at fair value through profit or loss, in the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the group.
Purpose of related party disclosures
For example, entities frequently carry on parts of their activities through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
In those circumstances, the entity has the ability to affect the financial and operating policies of the investee through the presence of control, joint control or significant influence.
Related parties may enter into transactions that unrelated parties would not.
For example, an entity that sells goods to its parent at cost might not sell on those terms to another customer.
Also, transactions between related parties may not be made at the same amounts as between unrelated parties.
The mere existence of the relationship may be sufficient to affect the transactions of the entity with other parties.
For example, a subsidiary may terminate relations with a trading partner on acquisition by the parent of a fellow subsidiary engaged in the same activity as the former trading partner.
A related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial statements (in this Standard referred to as the 'reporting entity').
has control or joint control of the reporting entity;
has significant influence over the reporting entity; or
If the reporting entity is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the reporting entity.
(viii) The entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the reporting entity.
A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between a reporting entity and a related party, regardless of whether a price is charged.
that person's children and spouse or domestic partner;
dependants of that person or that person's spouse or domestic partner.
Employee benefits are all forms of consideration paid, payable or provided by the entity, or on behalf of the entity, in exchange for services rendered to the entity.
It also includes such consideration paid on behalf of a parent of the entity in respect of the entity.
post-employment benefits such as pensions, other retirement benefits, post-employment life insurance and post-employment medical care;
Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that entity.
Government refers to government, government agencies and similar bodies whether local, national or international.
A government-related entity is an entity that is controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by a government.
simply by virtue of their normal dealings with an entity (even though they may affect the freedom of action of an entity or participate in its decision-making process).
a customer, supplier, franchisor, distributor or general agent with whom an entity transacts a significant volume of business, simply by virtue of the resulting economic dependence.
Therefore, for example, an associate's subsidiary and the investor that has significant influence over the associate are related to each other.
An entity shall disclose the name of its parent and, if different, the ultimate controlling party.
If neither the entity's parent nor the ultimate controlling party produces consolidated financial statements available for public use, the name of the next most senior parent that does so shall also be disclosed.
At a minimum, disclosures shall include
the amount of the transactions;
the amount of outstanding balances, including commitments, and
their terms and conditions, including whether they are secured, and the nature of the consideration to be provided in settlement; and
details of any guarantees given or received;
the expense recognised during the period in respect of bad or doubtful debts due from related parties.
Amounts incurred by the entity for the provision of key management personnel services that are provided by a separate management entity shall be disclosed.
entities with joint control of, or significant influence over, the entity;
joint ventures in which the entity is a joint venturer;
The categories are extended to provide a more comprehensive analysis of related party balances and apply to related party transactions.
purchases or sales of goods (finished or unfinished);
purchases or sales of property and other assets;
rendering or receiving of services;
transfers of research and development;
transfers under finance arrangements (including loans and equity contributions in cash or in kind);
provision of guarantees or collateral;
settlement of liabilities on behalf of the entity or by the entity on behalf of that related party.
a government that has control or joint control of, or significant influence over, the reporting entity; and
another entity that is a related party because the same government has control or joint control of, or significant influence over, both the reporting entity and the other entity.
the name of the government and the nature of its relationship with the reporting entity (ie control, joint control or significant influence);
the following information in sufficient detail to enable users of the entity's financial statements to understand the effect of related party transactions on its financial statements

If an entity applies those amendments earlier it shall also apply all amendments included in Investment Entities at the same time.
Separating components from an insurance contract
LEVEL OF AGGREGATION OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS
Risk adjustment for non-financial risk
Premium allocation approach for reinsurance contracts held
Investment contracts with discretionary participation features
PRESENTATION IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
Insurance finance income or expenses
Enforceability of the rights and obligations in a contract is a matter of law.
Contracts can be written, oral or implied by an entity's customary business practices.
Contractual terms include all terms in a contract, explicit or implied, but an entity shall disregard terms that have no commercial substance (ie no discernible effect on the economics of the contract).
Implied terms in a contract include those imposed by law or regulation.
The practices and processes for establishing contracts with customers vary across legal jurisdictions, industries and entities.
reinsurance contracts it holds; and
investment contracts with discretionary participation features it issues, provided the entity also issues insurance contracts.
for references to insurance contracts issued; and
financial guarantee contracts, unless the issuer has previously asserted explicitly that it regards such contracts as insurance contracts and has used accounting applicable to insurance contracts.
The issuer may make that choice contract by contract, but the choice for each contract is irrevocable.
insurance contracts in which the entity is the policyholder, unless those contracts are reinsurance contracts held (see paragraph 3(b)).
The entity may make that choice contract by contract, but the choice for each contract is irrevocable.
the entity does not reflect an assessment of the risk associated with an individual customer in setting the price of the contract with that customer;
the contract compensates the customer by providing services, rather than by making cash payments to the customer; and
the insurance risk transferred by the contract arises primarily from the customer's use of services rather than from uncertainty over the cost of those services.
In order to report the substance of such contracts, it may be necessary to treat the set or series of contracts as a whole.
Separating components from an insurance contract (paragraphs B31-B35)
For example, an insurance contract may include an investment component or a service component (or both).
separate from a host insurance contract an investment component if, and only if, that investment component is distinct (see paragraphs B31-B32).
cash outflows that relate directly to each component are attributed to that component; and
any remaining cash outflows are attributed on a systematic and rational basis, reflecting the cash outflows the entity would expect to arise if that component were a separate contract.
Level of aggregation of insurance contracts
A portfolio comprises contracts subject to similar risks and managed together.
Contracts within a product line would be expected to have similar risks and hence would be expected to be in the same portfolio if they are managed together.
Contracts in different product lines (for example, single premium fixed annuities compared with regular term life assurance) would not be expected to have similar risks and hence would be expected to be in different portfolios.
a group of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition, if any;
a group of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently, if any; and
a group of the remaining contracts in the portfolio, if any.
If the entity does not have reasonable and supportable information to conclude that a set of contracts will all be in the same group, it shall determine the group to which contracts belong by considering individual contracts.
An entity shall assess whether contracts that are not onerous at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently by assessing the likelihood of changes in applicable facts and circumstances.
based on the likelihood of changes in assumptions which, if they occurred, would result in the contracts becoming onerous.
using information about estimates provided by the entity's internal reporting.
Hence, in assessing whether contracts that are not onerous at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous
an entity shall not disregard information provided by its internal reporting about the effect of changes in assumptions on different contracts on the possibility of their becoming onerous; but
an entity is not required to gather additional information beyond that provided by the entity's internal reporting about the effect of changes in assumptions on different contracts.
The entity shall not apply this paragraph by analogy to other items.
For example, an entity may choose to divide the portfolios into
different levels of profitability; or
different possibilities of contracts becoming onerous after initial recognition; and
An entity shall establish the groups at initial recognition, and shall not reassess the composition of the groups subsequently.
the beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts;
for a group of onerous contracts, when the group becomes onerous.
An entity shall derecognise the asset or liability resulting from such insurance acquisition cash flows when the group of insurance contracts to which the cash flows are allocated is recognised (see paragraph 38(b)).
An entity shall add the contracts to the group in the reporting period in which the contracts are issued.
This may result in a change to the determination of the discount rates at the date of initial recognition applying paragraph B73.
An entity shall apply the revised rates from the start of the reporting period in which the new contracts are added to the group.
Measurement on initial recognition (paragraphs B36-B95)

an adjustment to reflect the time value of money and the financial risks related to the future cash flows, to the extent that the financial risks are not included in the estimates of the future cash flows (paragraph 36); and
(iii) a risk adjustment for non-financial risk (paragraph 37).
Estimates of future cash flows (paragraphs B36-B71)
The estimates of future cash flows shall
reflect the perspective of the entity, provided that the estimates of any relevant market variables are consistent with observable market prices for those variables (see paragraphs B42-B53).
be current -- the estimates shall reflect conditions existing at the measurement date, including assumptions at that date about the future (see paragraphs B54-B60).
The entity also shall estimate the cash flows separately from the adjustment for the time value of money and financial risk, unless the most appropriate measurement technique combines these estimates (see paragraph B46).
A substantive obligation to provide services ends when
the entity has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the particular policyholder and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those risks; or
both of the following criteria are satisfied
the entity has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the portfolio of insurance contracts that contains the contract and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects the risk of that portfolio; and
Such amounts relate to future insurance contracts.
reflect the time value of money, the characteristics of the cash flows and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts;
be consistent with observable current market prices (if any) for financial instruments with cash flows whose characteristics are consistent with those of the insurance contracts, in terms of, for example, timing, currency and liquidity; and
exclude the effect of factors that influence such observable market prices but do not affect the future cash flows of the insurance contracts.

such increases in the fulfilment cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the contractual service margin, giving rise to a loss (see paragraph 48(a)); or
such decreases in the fulfilment cash flows are allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage applying paragraph 50(b).
the effect of any currency exchange differences on the contractual service margin; and
the entity's share of the change in the fair value of the underlying items (see paragraph B104(b)(i)), except to the extent that
paragraph B115 (on risk mitigation) applies;
(iii) the entity's share of an increase in the fair value of the underlying items reverses the amount in (ii).
the changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service, as specified in paragraphs B101-B118, except to the extent that

changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk recognised in profit or loss because of the release from risk; and
insurance finance income or expenses.
Variability in the fulfilment cash flows increases with, for example
the length of the coverage period of the group of contracts.
on initial recognition, the carrying amount of the liability is
the premiums, if any, received at initial recognition;
minus any insurance acquisition cash flows at that date, unless the entity chooses to recognise the payments as an expense applying paragraph 59(a); and
at the end of each subsequent reporting period, the carrying amount of the liability is the carrying amount at the start of the reporting period
plus the premiums received in the period;
minus insurance acquisition cash flows; unless the entity chooses to recognise the payments as an expense applying paragraph 59(a);
minus the amount recognised as insurance revenue for coverage provided in that period (see paragraph B126); and
(vi) minus any investment component paid or transferred to the liability for incurred claims.
However, if, in applying paragraph 59(b), the entity does not adjust the liability for incurred claims for the time value of money and the effect of financial risk, it shall not include in the fulfilment cash flows any such adjustment.
if the reinsurance contracts held provide proportionate coverage -- at the beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held or at the initial recognition of any underlying contract, whichever is the later; and
in all other cases -- from the beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held.
In addition, the entity shall include in the estimates of the present value of the future cash flows for the group of reinsurance contracts held the effect of any risk of non-performance by the issuer of the reinsurance contract, including the effects of collateral and losses from disputes.
the entity shall recognise any net cost or net gain on purchasing the group of reinsurance contracts held as a contractual service margin measured at an amount equal to the sum of the fulfilment cash flows, the amount derecognised at that date of any asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group of reinsurance contracts held, and any cash flows arising at that date; unless
the net cost of purchasing reinsurance coverage relates to events that occurred before the purchase of the group of reinsurance contracts, in which case, notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph B5, the entity shall recognise such a cost immediately in profit or loss as an expense.

the allocation of the contractual service margin (see paragraphs 44(e) and 45(e)) is modified so that the entity shall recognise the contractual service margin over the duration of the group of contracts in a systematic way that reflects the transfer of investment services under the contract.
The exercise of a right included in the terms of a contract is not a modification.
if the modified terms had been included at contract inception
it is extinguished, ie when the obligation specified in the insurance contract expires or is discharged or cancelled; or
the fulfilment cash flows allocated to the group are adjusted to eliminate the present value of the future cash flows and risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to the rights and obligations that have been derecognised from the group, applying paragraphs 40(a)(i) and 40(b);
the change in the carrying amount of the group of insurance contracts resulting from the derecognition of the contract, applying paragraph 76(a).
Presentation in the statement of financial position
Insurance revenue shall depict the provision of coverage and other services arising from the group of insurance contracts at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those services.
Paragraphs B120-B127 specify how an entity measures insurance revenue.
If an entity presents separately the amounts recovered from the reinsurer and an allocation of the premiums paid, it shall
treat reinsurance cash flows that are contingent on claims on the underlying contracts as part of the claims that are expected to be reimbursed under the reinsurance contract held;
treat amounts from the reinsurer that it expects to receive that are not contingent on claims of the underlying contracts (for example, some types of ceding commissions) as a reduction in the premiums to be paid to the reinsurer; and
not present the allocation of premiums paid as a reduction in revenue.
Insurance finance income or expenses (see paragraphs B128-B136)

the effect of financial risk and changes in financial risk; but
These are included in insurance service expenses.
including insurance finance income or expenses for the period in profit or loss; or
disaggregating insurance finance income or expenses for the period to include in profit or loss an amount determined by a systematic allocation of the expected total insurance finance income or expenses over the duration of the group of contracts, applying paragraphs B130-B133.
disaggregating insurance finance income or expenses for the period to include in profit or loss an amount that eliminates accounting mismatches with income or expenses included in profit or loss on the underlying items held, applying paragraphs B134-B136.
To achieve that objective, an entity shall disclose qualitative and quantitative information about
Examples of aggregation bases that might be appropriate for information disclosed about insurance contracts are
type of contract (for example, major product lines);
geographical area (for example, country or region); or
If an entity uses the premium allocation approach, it shall also disclose
the method it has chosen to recognise insurance acquisition cash flows applying paragraph 59(a).
Separate reconciliations shall be disclosed for insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held.
To comply with this requirement, an entity shall

changes that relate to current service, ie
the amount of the contractual service margin recognised in profit or loss to reflect the transfer of services;

Such information shall be provided separately for insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held.
In particular, an entity shall explain the relationship between insurance finance income or expenses and the investment return on its assets, to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the sources of finance income or expenses recognised in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

Hence an entity shall disclose the reconciliation of the contractual service margin applying paragraph 101(c), and the amount of insurance revenue applying paragraph 103(a), separately for
insurance contracts that existed at the transition date to which the entity has applied the modified retrospective approach;
insurance contracts that existed at the transition date to which the entity has applied the fair value approach; and
For all periods in which amounts determined applying these paragraphs exist, the entity shall disclose a reconciliation from the opening to the closing balance of the cumulative amounts included in other comprehensive income for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income related to the groups of insurance contracts.
The reconciliation shall include, for example, gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income in the period and gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income in previous periods reclassified in the period to profit or loss.
Specifically, an entity shall disclose the inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used, including

When an entity provides this disclosure in aggregate for a number of groups of insurance contracts, it shall provide such disclosures in the form of weighted averages, or relatively narrow ranges.
Financial risks typically include, but are not limited to, credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
the exposures to risks and how they arise;

Concentrations of financial risk might arise, for example, from interest-rate guarantees that come into effect at the same level for a large number of contracts.
Concentrations of financial risk might also arise from concentrations of non-financial risk; for example, if an entity provides product liability protection to pharmaceutical companies and also holds investments in those companies.
To comply with this requirement, an entity shall disclose
a sensitivity analysis that shows how profit or loss and equity would have been affected by changes in risk exposures that were reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period

This appendix provides guidance on the following
definition of an insurance contract (see paragraphs B2-B30);
separation of components from an insurance contract (see paragraphs B31-B35);
insurance finance income or expenses (see paragraphs B128-B136); and
interim financial statements (see paragraph B137).
Definition of an insurance contract (Appendix A)
This section provides guidance on the definition of an insurance contract as specified in Appendix A. It addresses the following
uncertain future event (see paragraphs B3-B5);
payments in kind (see paragraph B6);
the distinction between insurance risk and other risks (see paragraphs B7-B16);
significant insurance risk (see paragraphs B17-B23);
changes in the level of insurance risk (see paragraphs B24-B25); and
examples of insurance contracts (see paragraphs B26-B30).
the probability of an insured event occurring;
when the insured event will occur; or
how much the entity will need to pay if the insured event occurs.
In some insurance contracts, the insured event is the discovery of a loss during the term of the contract, even if that loss arises from an event that occurred before the inception of the contract.
Some insurance contracts cover events that have already occurred but the financial effect of which is still uncertain.
An example is an insurance contract that provides coverage against an adverse development of an event that has already occurred.
In such contracts, the insured event is the determination of the ultimate cost of those claims.
Some insurance contracts require or permit payments to be made in kind.
In such cases, the entity provides goods or services to the policyholder to settle the entity's obligation to compensate the policyholder for insured events.
An example is when the entity replaces a stolen article instead of reimbursing the policyholder for the amount of its loss.
Another example is when an entity uses its own hospitals and medical staff to provide medical services covered by the insurance contract.
Such contracts are insurance contracts, even though the claims are settled in kind.
The distinction between insurance risk and other risks
The definition of financial risk in Appendix A refers to financial and non-financial variables.
Examples of non-financial variables not specific to a party to the contract include an index of earthquake losses in a particular region or temperatures in a particular city.
Financial risk excludes risk from non-financial variables that are specific to a party to the contract, such as the occurrence or non-occurrence of a fire that damages or destroys an asset of that party.
Furthermore, the risk of changes in the fair value of a non-financial asset is not a financial risk if the fair value reflects changes in the market prices for such assets (ie a financial variable) and the condition of a specific non-financial asset held by a party to a contract (ie a non-financial variable).
For example, if a guarantee of the residual value of a specific car in which the policyholder has an insurable interest exposes the guarantor to the risk of changes in the car's physical condition, that risk is insurance risk, not financial risk.
Some contracts expose the issuer to financial risk in addition to significant insurance risk.
For example, many life insurance contracts guarantee a minimum rate of return to policyholders, creating financial risk, and at the same time promise death benefits that may significantly exceed the policyholder's account balance, creating insurance risk in the form of mortality risk.
Such contracts are insurance contracts.
Such contracts are insurance contracts, provided that the payment contingent on the insured event could be significant.
For example, a life-contingent annuity linked to a cost-of-living index transfers insurance risk because the payment is triggered by an uncertain future event -- the survival of the person who receives the annuity.
The link to the price index is a derivative, but it also transfers insurance risk because the number of payments to which the index applies depends on the survival of the annuitant.
If the resulting transfer of insurance risk is significant, the derivative meets the definition of an insurance contract, in which case it shall not be separated from the host contract (see paragraph 11(a)).
Insurance risk is the risk the entity accepts from the policyholder.
This means the entity must accept, from the policyholder, a risk to which the policyholder was already exposed.
Any new risk created by the contract for the entity or the policyholder is not insurance risk.
This definition does not limit the payment by the entity to an amount equal to the financial effect of the adverse event.
For example, the definition includes 'new for old' coverage that pays the policyholder an amount that permits the replacement of a used and damaged asset with a new one.
Similarly, the definition does not limit the payment under a life insurance contract to the financial loss suffered by the deceased's dependants, nor does it exclude contracts that specify the payment of predetermined amounts to quantify the loss caused by death or an accident.
Some contracts require a payment if a specified uncertain future event occurs, but do not require an adverse effect on the policyholder as a precondition for the payment.
This type of contract is not an insurance contract even if the holder uses it to mitigate an underlying risk exposure.
For example, if the holder uses a derivative to hedge an underlying financial or non-financial variable correlated with the cash flows from an asset of the entity, the derivative is not an insurance contract because the payment is not conditional on whether the holder is adversely affected by a reduction in the cash flows from the asset.
The definition of an insurance contract refers to an uncertain future event for which an adverse effect on the policyholder is a contractual precondition for payment.
A contractual precondition does not require the entity to investigate whether the event actually caused an adverse effect, but it does permit the entity to deny the payment if it is not satisfied that the event did cause an adverse effect.
Lapse or persistency risk (the risk that the policyholder will cancel the contract earlier or later than the issuer had expected when pricing the contract) is not insurance risk because the resulting variability in the payment to the policyholder is not contingent on an uncertain future event that adversely affects the policyholder.
Similarly, expense risk (ie the risk of unexpected increases in the administrative costs associated with the servicing of a contract, rather than in the costs associated with insured events) is not insurance risk because an unexpected increase in such expenses does not adversely affect the policyholder.
Consequently, a contract that exposes the entity to lapse risk, persistency risk or expense risk is not an insurance contract unless it also exposes the entity to significant insurance risk.
An entity can accept significant insurance risk from the policyholder only if the entity is separate from the policyholder.
In the case of a mutual entity, the mutual entity accepts risk from each policyholder and pools that risk.
Although policyholders bear that pooled risk collectively because they hold the residual interest in the entity, the mutual entity is a separate entity that has accepted the risk.
Insurance risk is significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause the issuer to pay additional amounts that are significant in any single scenario, excluding scenarios that have no commercial substance (ie no discernible effect on the economics of the transaction).
In addition, a contract transfers significant insurance risk only if there is a scenario that has commercial substance in which the issuer has a possibility of a loss on a present value basis.
However, even if a reinsurance contract does not expose the issuer to the possibility of a significant loss, that contract is deemed to transfer significant insurance risk if it transfers to the reinsurer substantially all the insurance risk relating to the reinsured portions of the underlying insurance contracts.
The additional amounts described in paragraph B18 are determined on a present-value basis.
If an insurance contract requires payment when an event with uncertain timing occurs and if the payment is not adjusted for the time value of money, there may be scenarios in which the present value of the payment increases, even if its nominal value is fixed.
An example is insurance that provides a fixed death benefit when the policyholder dies, with no expiry date for the cover (often referred to as whole-life insurance for a fixed amount).
Payments may be made when an individual policyholder dies earlier than expected.
Because those payments are not adjusted for the time value of money, significant insurance risk could exist even if there is no overall loss on the portfolio of contracts.
Similarly, contractual terms that delay timely reimbursement to the policyholder can eliminate significant insurance risk.
The additional amounts described in paragraph B18 refer to the present value of amounts that exceed those that would be payable if no insured event had occurred (excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance).
Those additional amounts include claims handling and assessment costs, but exclude
the loss of the ability to charge the policyholder for future service.
For example, in an investment-linked life insurance contract, the death of the policyholder means that the entity can no longer perform investment management services and collect a fee for doing so.
However, this economic loss for the entity does not result from insurance risk, just as a mutual fund manager does not take on insurance risk in relation to the possible death of a client.
Consequently, the potential loss of future investment management fees is not relevant when assessing how much insurance risk is transferred by a contract.
a waiver, on death, of charges that would be made on cancellation or surrender.
Because the contract brought those charges into existence, their waiver does not compensate the policyholder for a pre-existing risk.
Consequently, they are not relevant when assessing how much insurance risk is transferred by a contract.
An entity shall assess the significance of insurance risk contract by contract.
Consequently, the insurance risk can be significant even if there is minimal probability of significant losses for a portfolio or group of contracts.
It follows from paragraphs B18-B22 that, if a contract pays a death benefit that exceeds the amount payable on survival, the contract is an insurance contract unless the additional death benefit is not significant (judged by reference to the contract itself rather than to an entire portfolio of contracts).
As noted in paragraph B21(b), the waiver on death of cancellation or surrender charges is not included in this assessment if that waiver does not compensate the policyholder for a pre-existing risk.
For some contracts, the transfer of insurance risk to the issuer occurs after a period of time.
For example, consider a contract that provides a specified investment return and includes an option for the policyholder to use the proceeds of the investment on maturity to buy a life-contingent annuity at the same rates the entity charges other new annuitants at the time the policyholder exercises that option.
Consequently, the cash flows that would occur on the exercise of the option fall outside the boundary of the contract, and before exercise there are no insurance cash flows within the boundary of the contract.
However, if the contract specifies the annuity rates (or a basis other than market rates for setting the annuity rates), the contract transfers insurance risk to the issuer because the issuer is exposed to the risk that the annuity rates will be unfavourable to the issuer when the policyholder exercises the option.
In that case, the cash flows that would occur when the option is exercised are within the boundary of the contract.
The following are examples of contracts that are insurance contracts if the transfer of insurance risk is significant
insurance against theft or damage.
insurance against disability and medical costs.
surety bonds, fidelity bonds, performance bonds and bid bonds, ie contracts that compensate the holder if another party fails to perform a contractual obligation; for example, an obligation to construct a building.
title insurance (insurance against the discovery of defects in the title to land or buildings that were not apparent when the insurance contract was issued).
travel insurance (compensation in cash or in kind to policyholders for losses suffered in advance of, or during, travel).
catastrophe bonds that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both, if a specified event adversely affects the issuer of the bond (unless the specified event does not create significant insurance risk; for example, if the event is a change in an interest rate or a foreign exchange rate).
insurance swaps and other contracts that require a payment depending on changes in climatic, geological or other physical variables that are specific to a party to the contract.
The following are examples of items that are not insurance contracts
investment contracts that have the legal form of an insurance contract but do not transfer significant insurance risk to the issuer.
contracts that have the legal form of insurance, but return all significant insurance risk to the policyholder through non-cancellable and enforceable mechanisms that adjust future payments by the policyholder to the issuer as a direct result of insured losses. For example, some financial reinsurance contracts or some group contracts return all significant insurance risk to the policyholders; such contracts are normally financial instruments or service contracts (see paragraph B28).
In such situations, there is no insurance contract because there is no agreement with another party.
Thus, if an entity issues an insurance contract to its parent, subsidiary or fellow subsidiary, there is no insurance contract in the consolidated financial statements because there is no contract with another party.
However, for the individual or separate financial statements of the issuer or holder, there is an insurance contract.
contracts (such as gambling contracts) that require a payment if a specified uncertain future event occurs, but do not require, as a contractual precondition for payment, the event to adversely affect the policyholder.
However, this does not exclude from the definition of an insurance contract contracts that specify a predetermined payout to quantify the loss caused by a specified event such as a death or an accident (see paragraph B12).
contracts that require a payment that depends on a climatic, geological or any other physical variable not specific to a party to the contract (commonly described as weather derivatives).
contracts that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both, that depend on a climatic, geological or any other physical variable, the effect of which is not specific to a party to the contract (commonly referred to as catastrophe bonds).
The credit-related guarantees and credit insurance contracts discussed in paragraph B27(f) can have various legal forms, such as that of a guarantee, some types of letters of credit, a credit default contract or an insurance contract.
Those contracts are insurance contracts if they require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that the holder incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due to the policyholder applying the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
Such contracts include those that require payment
regardless of whether the counterparty holds the underlying debt instrument; or
on a change in the credit rating or the credit index, rather than on the failure of a specified debtor to make payments when due.
Paragraph 11(b) requires an entity to separate a distinct investment component from the host insurance contract.
An investment component is distinct if, and only if, both the following conditions are met
the investment component and the insurance component are not highly interrelated.
a contract with equivalent terms is sold, or could be sold, separately in the same market or the same jurisdiction, either by entities that issue insurance contracts or by other parties.
The entity shall take into account all information reasonably available in making this determination.
The entity is not required to undertake an exhaustive search to identify whether an investment component is sold separately.
An investment component and an insurance component are highly interrelated if, and only if
For the purpose of separation, an entity shall not consider activities that an entity must undertake to fulfil a contract unless the entity transfers a good or service to the policyholder as those activities occur.
A good or non-insurance service that is promised to the policyholder is not distinct if
the cash flows and risks associated with the good or service are highly interrelated with the cash flows and risks associated with the insurance components in the contract; and
the entity provides a significant service in integrating the good or non-insurance service with the insurance components.
unbiased use of all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort (see paragraphs B37-B41);
market variables and non-market variables (see paragraphs B42-B53);
using current estimates (see paragraphs B54-B60); and
cash flows within the contract boundary (see paragraphs B61-B71).
Unbiased use of all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort (paragraph 33(a))
The objective of estimating future cash flows is to determine the expected value, or probability-weighted mean, of the full range of possible outcomes, considering all reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date without undue cost or effort.
Reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date without undue cost or effort includes information about past events and current conditions, and forecasts of future conditions (see paragraph B41).
Information available from an entity's own information systems is considered to be available without undue cost or effort.
The starting point for an estimate of the cash flows is a range of scenarios that reflects the full range of possible outcomes.
Each scenario specifies the amount and timing of the cash flows for a particular outcome, and the estimated probability of that outcome.
The cash flows from each scenario are discounted and weighted by the estimated probability of that outcome to derive an expected present value.
Consequently, the objective is not to develop a most likely outcome, or a more-likely-than-not outcome, for future cash flows.
When considering the full range of possible outcomes, the objective is to incorporate all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort in an unbiased way, rather than to identify every possible scenario.
In practice, developing explicit scenarios is unnecessary if the resulting estimate is consistent with the measurement objective of considering all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort when determining the mean.
For example, if an entity estimates that the probability distribution of outcomes is broadly consistent with a probability distribution that can be described completely with a small number of parameters, it will be sufficient to estimate the smaller number of parameters.
Similarly, in some cases, relatively simple modelling may give an answer within an acceptable range of precision, without the need for many detailed simulations.
However, in some cases, the cash flows may be driven by complex underlying factors and may respond in a non-linear fashion to changes in economic conditions.
This may happen if, for example, the cash flows reflect a series of interrelated options that are implicit or explicit.
In such cases, more sophisticated stochastic modelling is likely to be necessary to satisfy the measurement objective.
An entity shall estimate the probabilities and amounts of future payments under existing contracts on the basis of information obtained including
information about claims already reported by policyholders.
other information about the known or estimated characteristics of the insurance contracts.
historical data about the entity's own experience, supplemented when necessary with historical data from other sources.
Historical data is adjusted to reflect current conditions, for example, if
the characteristics of the insured population differ (or will differ, for example, because of adverse selection) from those of the population that has been used as a basis for the historical data;
there are indications that historical trends will not continue, that new trends will emerge or that economic, demographic and other changes may affect the cash flows that arise from the existing insurance contracts; or
current price information, if available, for reinsurance contracts and other financial instruments (if any) covering similar risks, such as catastrophe bonds and weather derivatives, and recent market prices for transfers of insurance contracts.
This information shall be adjusted to reflect the differences between the cash flows that arise from those reinsurance contracts or other financial instruments, and the cash flows that would arise as the entity fulfils the underlying contracts with the policyholder.
market variables -- variables that can be observed in, or derived directly from, markets (for example, prices of publicly traded securities and interest rates); and
non-market variables -- all other variables (for example, the frequency and severity of insurance claims and mortality).
Market variables will generally give rise to financial risk (for example, observable interest rates) and non-market variables will generally give rise to non-financial risk (for example, mortality rates).
However, this will not always be the case.
For example, there may be assumptions that relate to financial risks for which variables cannot be observed in, or derived directly from, markets (for example, interest rates that cannot be observed in, or derived directly from, markets).
Estimates of market variables shall be consistent with observable market prices at the measurement date.
Consistent with IFRS 13, if variables need to be derived (for example, because no observable market variables exist) they shall be as consistent as possible with observable market variables.
Market prices blend a range of views about possible future outcomes and also reflect the risk preferences of market participants.
Consequently, they are not a single-point forecast of the future outcome.
If the actual outcome differs from the previous market price, this does not mean that the market price was 'wrong'.
An important application of market variables is the notion of a replicating asset or a replicating portfolio of assets.
In some cases, a replicating asset may exist for some of the cash flows that arise from a group of insurance contracts.
The fair value of that asset reflects both the expected present value of the cash flows from the asset and the risk associated with those cash flows.
If a replicating portfolio of assets exists for some of the cash flows that arise from a group of insurance contracts, the entity can use the fair value of those assets to measure the relevant fulfilment cash flows instead of explicitly estimating the cash flows and discount rate.
However, if a replicating asset or portfolio does exist for some of the cash flows that arise from insurance contracts and an entity chooses to use a different technique, the entity shall satisfy itself that a replicating portfolio technique would be unlikely to lead to a materially different measurement of those cash flows.
Techniques other than a replicating portfolio technique, such as stochastic modelling techniques, may be more robust or easier to implement if there are significant interdependencies between cash flows that vary based on returns on assets and other cash flows.
Judgement is required to determine the technique that best meets the objective of consistency with observable market variables in specific circumstances.
In particular, the technique used must result in the measurement of any options and guarantees included in the insurance contracts being consistent with observable market prices (if any) for such options and guarantees.
Estimates of non-market variables shall reflect all reasonable and supportable evidence available without undue cost or effort, both external and internal.
Non-market external data (for example, national mortality statistics) may have more or less relevance than internal data (for example, internally developed mortality statistics), depending on the circumstances.
In developing those probabilities, an entity shall give more weight to the more persuasive information.
Estimated probabilities for non-market variables shall not contradict observable market variables.
For example, estimated probabilities for future inflation rate scenarios shall be as consistent as possible with probabilities implied by market interest rates.
In some cases, an entity may conclude that market variables vary independently of non-market variables.
If so, the entity shall consider scenarios that reflect the range of outcomes for the non-market variables, with each scenario using the same observed value of the market variable.
In other cases, market variables and non-market variables may be correlated.
For example, there may be evidence that lapse rates (a non-market variable) are correlated with interest rates (a market variable).
Similarly, there may be evidence that claim levels for house or car insurance are correlated with economic cycles and therefore with interest rates and expense amounts.
The entity shall ensure that the probabilities for the scenarios and the risk adjustments for the non-financial risk that relates to the market variables are consistent with the observed market prices that depend on those market variables.
Using current estimates (paragraph 33(c))
In estimating each cash flow scenario and its probability, an entity shall use all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort.
An entity shall review the estimates that it made at the end of the previous reporting period and update them.
the updated estimates faithfully represent the conditions at the end of the reporting period.
the changes in estimates faithfully represent the changes in conditions during the period.
If the conditions have not changed, shifting the estimates to the other end of the range at the end of the period would not faithfully represent what has happened during the period.
If an entity's most recent estimates are different from its previous estimates, but conditions have not changed, it shall assess whether the new probabilities assigned to each scenario are justified.
In updating its estimates of those probabilities, the entity shall consider both the evidence that supported its previous estimates and all newly available evidence, giving more weight to the more persuasive evidence.
The probability assigned to each scenario shall reflect the conditions at the end of the reporting period.
After the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, a major storm strikes.
The fulfilment cash flows under that contract shall not reflect the storm that, with hindsight, is known to have occurred.
Current estimates of expected cash flows are not necessarily identical to the most recent actual experience.
Several factors could have caused the sudden change in experience, including
changes in the characteristics of the insured population (for example, changes in underwriting or distribution, or selective lapses by policyholders in unusually good health);
An entity shall investigate the reasons for the change in experience and develop new estimates of cash flows and probabilities in the light of the most recent experience, the earlier experience and other information.
In the example in paragraph B56, if mortality rates continue to be significantly higher than the previous estimates for reasons that are expected to continue, the estimated probability assigned to the high-mortality scenarios will increase.
The determination of the fulfilment cash flows reflects the probabilities that would be assigned to each possible trend scenario, taking account of all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort.
Similarly, if cash flows allocated to a group of insurance contracts are sensitive to inflation, the determination of the fulfilment cash flows shall reflect current estimates of possible future inflation rates.
Because inflation rates are likely to be correlated with interest rates, the measurement of fulfilment cash flows shall reflect the probabilities for each inflation scenario in a way that is consistent with the probabilities implied by the market interest rates used in estimating the discount rate (see paragraph B51).
When estimating the cash flows, an entity shall take into account current expectations of future events that might affect those cash flows.
The entity shall develop cash flow scenarios that reflect those future events, as well as unbiased estimates of the probability of each scenario.
However, an entity shall not take into account current expectations of future changes in legislation that would change or discharge the present obligation or create new obligations under the existing insurance contract until the change in legislation is substantively enacted.
Cash flows within the contract boundary (paragraph 34)
Estimates of cash flows in a scenario shall include all cash flows within the boundary of an existing contract and no other cash flows.
Many insurance contracts have features that enable policyholders to take actions that change the amount, timing, nature or uncertainty of the amounts they will receive.
Such features include renewal options, surrender options, conversion options and options to stop paying premiums while still receiving benefits under the contracts.
The measurement of a group of insurance contracts shall reflect, on an expected value basis, the entity's current estimates of how the policyholders in the group will exercise the options available, and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk shall reflect the entity's current estimates of how the actual behaviour of the policyholders may differ from the expected behaviour.
continue their contracts, if there is some probability that some of the policyholders will not.
An entity has that practical ability in the absence of constraints that prevent the entity from setting the same price it would for a new contract with the same characteristics as the existing contract issued on that date, or if it can amend the benefits to be consistent with the price it will charge.
Similarly, an entity has that practical ability to set a price when it can reprice an existing contract so that the price reflects overall changes in the risks in a portfolio of insurance contracts, even if the price set for each individual policyholder does not reflect the change in risk for that specific policyholder.
When assessing whether the entity has the practical ability to set a price that fully reflects the risks in the contract or portfolio, it shall consider all the risks that it would consider when underwriting equivalent contracts on the renewal date for the remaining coverage.
In determining the estimates of future cash flows at the end of a reporting period, an entity shall reassess the boundary of an insurance contract to include the effect of changes in circumstances on the entity's substantive rights and obligations.
Cash flows within the boundary of an insurance contract are those that relate directly to the fulfilment of the contract, including cash flows for which the entity has discretion over the amount or timing.
The cash flows within the boundary include
premiums (including premium adjustments and instalment premiums) from a policyholder and any additional cash flows that result from those premiums.
an allocation of insurance acquisition cash flows attributable to the portfolio to which the contract belongs.
claim handling costs (ie the costs the entity will incur in investigating, processing and resolving claims under existing insurance contracts, including legal and loss-adjusters' fees and internal costs of investigating claims and processing claim payments).
costs the entity will incur in providing contractual benefits paid in kind.
policy administration and maintenance costs, such as costs of premium billing and handling policy changes (for example, conversions and reinstatements).
Such costs also include recurring commissions that are expected to be paid to intermediaries if a particular policyholder continues to pay the premiums within the boundary of the insurance contract.
transaction-based taxes (such as premium taxes, value added taxes and goods and services taxes) and levies (such as fire service levies and guarantee fund assessments) that arise directly from existing insurance contracts, or that can be attributed to them on a reasonable and consistent basis.
payments by the insurer in a fiduciary capacity to meet tax obligations incurred by the policyholder, and related receipts.
potential cash inflows from recoveries (such as salvage and subrogation) on future claims covered by existing insurance contracts and, to the extent that they do not qualify for recognition as separate assets, potential cash inflows from recoveries on past claims.
an allocation of fixed and variable overheads (such as the costs of accounting, human resources, information technology and support, building depreciation, rent, and maintenance and utilities) directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts.
Such overheads are allocated to groups of contracts using methods that are systematic and rational, and are consistently applied to all costs that have similar characteristics.
(m) any other costs specifically chargeable to the policyholder under the terms of the contract.
The following cash flows shall not be included when estimating the cash flows that will arise as the entity fulfils an existing insurance contract
cash flows that arise from abnormal amounts of wasted labour or other resources that are used to fulfil the contract. Such costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
cash flows between different components of the reporting entity, such as policyholder funds and shareholder funds, if those cash flows do not change the amount that will be paid to the policyholders.
Contracts with cash flows that affect or are affected by cash flows to policyholders of other contracts
Some insurance contracts affect the cash flows to policyholders of other contracts by requiring
the policyholder to share with policyholders of other contracts the returns on the same specified pool of underlying items; and
the policyholder to bear a reduction in their share of the returns on the underlying items because of payments to policyholders of other contracts that share in that pool, including payments arising under guarantees made to policyholders of those other contracts; or
policyholders of other contracts to bear a reduction in their share of returns on the underlying items because of payments to the policyholder, including payments arising from guarantees made to the policyholder.
Sometimes, such contracts will affect the cash flows to policyholders of contracts in other groups.
The fulfilment cash flows of each group reflect the extent to which the contracts in the group cause the entity to be affected by expected cash flows, whether to policyholders in that group or to policyholders in another group.
Hence the fulfilment cash flows for a group
include payments arising from the terms of existing contracts to policyholders of contracts in other groups, regardless of whether those payments are expected to be made to current or future policyholders; and
exclude payments to policyholders in the group that, applying (a), have been included in the fulfilment cash flows of another group.
Different practical approaches can be used to determine the fulfilment cash flows of groups of contracts that affect or are affected by cash flows to policyholders of contracts in other groups.
In some cases, an entity might be able to identify the change in the underlying items and resulting change in the cash flows only at a higher level of aggregation than the groups.
In such cases, the entity shall allocate the effect of the change in the underlying items to each group on a systematic and rational basis.
After all the coverage has been provided to the contracts in a group, the fulfilment cash flows may still include payments expected to be made to current policyholders in other groups or future policyholders.
cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on any underlying items shall be discounted at rates that do not reflect any such variability;
cash flows that vary based on the returns on any financial underlying items shall be
discounted using rates that reflect that variability; or
adjusted for the effect of that variability and discounted at a rate that reflects the adjustment made.
nominal cash flows (ie those that include the effect of inflation) shall be discounted at rates that include the effect of inflation; and
real cash flows (ie those that exclude the effect of inflation) shall be discounted at rates that exclude the effect of inflation.
Paragraph B74(b) requires cash flows that vary based on the returns on underlying items to be discounted using rates that reflect that variability, or to be adjusted for the effect of that variability and discounted at a rate that reflects the adjustment made.
The variability is a relevant factor regardless of whether it arises because of contractual terms or because the entity exercises discretion, and regardless of whether the entity holds the underlying items.
Cash flows that vary with returns on underlying items with variable returns, but that are subject to a guarantee of a minimum return, do not vary solely based on the returns on the underlying items, even when the guaranteed amount is lower than the expected return on the underlying items.
Hence, an entity shall adjust the rate that reflects the variability of the returns on the underlying items for the effect of the guarantee, even when the guaranteed amount is lower than the expected return on the underlying items.
Discount rates shall include only relevant factors, ie factors that arise from the time value of money, the characteristics of the cash flows and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts.
Such discount rates may not be directly observable in the market.
Hence, when observable market rates for an instrument with the same characteristics are not available, or observable market rates for similar instruments are available but do not separately identify the factors that distinguish the instrument from the insurance contracts, an entity shall estimate the appropriate rates.
In applying an estimation technique, an entity shall
maximise the use of observable inputs (see paragraph B44) and reflect all reasonable and supportable information on non-market variables available without undue cost or effort, both external and internal (see paragraph B49).
In particular, the discount rates used shall not contradict any available and relevant market data, and any non-market variables used shall not contradict observable market variables.
reflect current market conditions from the perspective of a market participant.
exercise judgement to assess the degree of similarity between the features of the insurance contracts being measured and the features of the instrument for which observable market prices are available and adjust those prices to reflect the differences between them.
For cash flows of insurance contracts that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items, the discount rate reflects the yield curve in the appropriate currency for instruments that expose the holder to no or negligible credit risk, adjusted to reflect the liquidity characteristics of the group of insurance contracts.
That adjustment shall reflect the difference between the liquidity characteristics of the group of insurance contracts and the liquidity characteristics of the assets used to determine the yield curve.
Hence, for cash flows of insurance contracts that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items, an entity may determine discount rates by adjusting a liquid risk-free yield curve to reflect the differences between the liquidity characteristics of the financial instruments that underlie the rates observed in the market and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts (a bottom-up approach).
Alternatively, an entity may determine the appropriate discount rates for insurance contracts based on a yield curve that reflects the current market rates of return implicit in a fair value measurement of a reference portfolio of assets (a top-down approach).
An entity shall adjust that yield curve to eliminate any factors that are not relevant to the insurance contracts, but is not required to adjust the yield curve for differences in liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts and the reference portfolio.
In estimating the yield curve described in paragraph B81
if there is no market for assets in the reference portfolio, an entity shall apply an estimation technique.
develop unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances.
Such inputs might include the entity's own data and, in the context of IFRS 17, the entity might place more weight on long-term estimates than on short-term fluctuations; and
adjust those data to reflect all information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available.
In adjusting the yield curve, an entity shall adjust market rates observed in recent transactions in instruments with similar characteristics for movements in market factors since the transaction date, and shall adjust observed market rates to reflect the degree of dissimilarity between the instrument being measured and the instrument for which transaction prices are observable.
For cash flows of insurance contracts that do not vary based on the returns on the assets in the reference portfolio, such adjustments include
adjusting for differences between the amount, timing and uncertainty of the cash flows of the assets in the portfolio and the amount, timing and uncertainty of the cash flows of the insurance contracts; and
excluding market risk premiums for credit risk, which are relevant only to the assets included in the reference portfolio.
In principle, for cash flows of insurance contracts that do not vary based on the returns of the assets in the reference portfolio, there should be a single illiquid risk-free yield curve that eliminates all uncertainty about the amount and timing of cash flows.
However, in practice the top-down approach and the bottom-up approach may result in different yield curves, even in the same currency.
This is because of the inherent limitations in estimating the adjustments made under each approach, and the possible lack of an adjustment for different liquidity characteristics in the top-down approach.
An entity is not required to reconcile the discount rate determined under its chosen approach with the discount rate that would have been determined under the other approach.
However, fewer adjustments would be required to eliminate factors that are not relevant to the insurance contracts when the reference portfolio of assets has similar characteristics.
For example, if the cash flows from the insurance contracts do not vary based on the returns on underlying items, fewer adjustments would be required if an entity used debt instruments as a starting point rather than equity instruments.
For debt instruments, the objective would be to eliminate from the total bond yield the effect of credit risk and other factors that are not relevant to the insurance contracts.
Risk adjustment for non-financial risk (paragraph 37)
The risk adjustment for non-financial risk relates to risk arising from insurance contracts other than financial risk.
Financial risk is included in the estimates of the future cash flows or the discount rate used to adjust the cash flows.
The risks covered by the risk adjustment for non-financial risk are insurance risk and other non-financial risks such as lapse risk and expense risk (see paragraph B14).
The risk adjustment for non-financial risk for insurance contracts measures the compensation that the entity would require to make the entity indifferent between
fulfilling a liability that has a range of possible outcomes arising from non-financial risk; and
fulfilling a liability that will generate fixed cash flows with the same expected present value as the insurance contracts.
As a result, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk conveys information to users of financial statements about the amount charged by the entity for the uncertainty arising from non-financial risk about the amount and timing of cash flows.
Because the risk adjustment for non-financial risk reflects the compensation the entity would require for bearing the non-financial risk arising from the uncertain amount and timing of the cash flows, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk also reflects
the degree of diversification benefit the entity includes when determining the compensation it requires for bearing that risk; and
both favourable and unfavourable outcomes, in a way that reflects the entity's degree of risk aversion.
The purpose of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is to measure the effect of uncertainty in the cash flows that arise from insurance contracts, other than uncertainty arising from financial risk.
However, to reflect the compensation the entity would require for bearing the non-financial risk, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk shall have the following characteristics
risks with low frequency and high severity will result in higher risk adjustments for non-financial risk than risks with high frequency and low severity;
for similar risks, contracts with a longer duration will result in higher risk adjustments for non-financial risk than contracts with a shorter duration;
risks with a wider probability distribution will result in higher risk adjustments for non-financial risk than risks with a narrower distribution;
the less that is known about the current estimate and its trend, the higher will be the risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and
to the extent that emerging experience reduces uncertainty about the amount and timing of cash flows, risk adjustments for non-financial risk will decrease and vice versa.
An entity shall apply judgement when determining an appropriate estimation technique for the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.
When applying that judgement, an entity shall also consider whether the technique provides concise and informative disclosure so that users of financial statements can benchmark the entity's performance against the performance of other entities.
Initial recognition of transfers of insurance contracts and business combinations (paragraph 39)
An entity shall use the consideration received or paid for the contracts as a proxy for the premiums received.
The consideration received or paid for the contracts excludes the consideration received or paid for any other assets and liabilities acquired in the same transaction.
In a business combination, the consideration received or paid is the fair value of the contracts at that date.
If acquired insurance contracts issued are onerous, applying paragraph 47, the entity shall recognise the excess of the fulfilment cash flows over the consideration paid or received as part of goodwill or gain on a bargain purchase for contracts acquired in a business combination or as a loss in profit or loss for contracts acquired in a transfer.
Changes in the carrying amount of the contractual service margin for insurance contracts without direct participation features (paragraph 44)
For insurance contracts without direct participation features, paragraph 44(c) requires an adjustment to the contractual service margin of a group of insurance contracts for changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service.
experience adjustments arising from premiums received in the period that relate to future service, and related cash flows such as insurance acquisition cash flows and premium-based taxes, measured at the discount rates specified in paragraph B72(c);
changes in estimates of the present value of the future cash flows in the liability for remaining coverage, except those described in paragraph B97(a), measured at the discount rates specified in paragraph B72(c);
differences between any investment component expected to become payable in the period and the actual investment component that becomes payable in the period, measured at the discount rates specified in paragraph B72(c); and
changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that relate to future service.
An entity shall not adjust the contractual service margin for a group of insurance contracts without direct participation features for the following changes in fulfilment cash flows because they do not relate to future service
the effect of the time value of money and changes in the time value of money and the effect of financial risk and changes in financial risk (being the effect, if any, on estimated future cash flows and the effect of a change in discount rate);
changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows in the liability for incurred claims; and
experience adjustments, except those described in paragraph B96(a).
The terms of some insurance contracts without direct participation features give an entity discretion over the cash flows to be paid to policyholders.
An entity shall use that specification to distinguish between the effect of changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk on that commitment (which do not adjust the contractual service margin) and the effect of discretionary changes to that commitment (which adjust the contractual service margin).
If an entity cannot specify at inception of the contract what it regards as its commitment under the contract and what it regards as discretionary, it shall regard its commitment to be the return implicit in the estimate of the fulfilment cash flows at inception of the contract, updated to reflect current assumptions that relate to financial risk.
Changes in the carrying amount of the contractual service margin for insurance contracts with direct participation features (paragraph 45)
Insurance contracts with direct participation features are insurance contracts that are substantially investment-related service contracts under which an entity promises an investment return based on underlying items.
Hence, they are defined as insurance contracts for which
the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items (see paragraphs B105-B106);
the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items (see paragraph B107); and
the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items (see paragraph B107).
To the extent that insurance contracts in a group affect the cash flows to policyholders of contracts in other groups (see paragraphs B67-B71), an entity shall assess whether the conditions in paragraph B101 are met by considering the cash flows that the entity expects to pay the policyholders determined applying paragraphs B68-B70.
The conditions in paragraph B101 ensure that insurance contracts with direct participation features are contracts under which the entity's obligation to the policyholder is the net of
the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items; and
a variable fee (see paragraphs B110-B118) that the entity will deduct from (a) in exchange for the future service provided by the insurance contract, comprising
the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items; less
fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items.
A share referred to in paragraph B101(a) does not preclude the existence of the entity's discretion to vary the amounts paid to the policyholder.
The pool of underlying items referred to in paragraph B101(a) can comprise any items, for example, a reference portfolio of assets, the net assets of the entity, or a specified subset of the net assets of the entity, as long as they are clearly identified by the contract.
An entity need not hold the identified pool of underlying items.
However, a clearly identified pool of underlying items does not exist when
an entity can change the underlying items that determine the amount of the entity's obligation with retrospective effect; or
there are no underlying items identified, even if the policyholder could be provided with a return that generally reflects the entity's overall performance and expectations, or the performance and expectations of a subset of assets the entity holds.
An example of such a return is a crediting rate or dividend payment set at the end of the period to which it relates.
In this case, the obligation to the policyholder reflects the crediting rate or dividend amounts the entity has set, and does not reflect identified underlying items.
Paragraph B101(b) requires that the entity expects a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items will be paid to the policyholder and paragraph B101(c) requires that the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.
interpret the term 'substantial' in both paragraphs in the context of the objective of insurance contracts with direct participation features being contracts under which the entity provides investment-related services and is compensated for the services by a fee that is determined by reference to the underlying items; and
assess the variability in the amounts in paragraphs B101(b) and B101(c)
over the duration of the group of insurance contracts; and
on a present value probability-weighted average basis, not a best or worst outcome basis (see paragraphs B37-B38).
For example, if the entity expects to pay a substantial share of the fair value returns on underlying items, subject to a guarantee of a minimum return, there will be scenarios in which
the cash flows that the entity expects to pay to the policyholder vary with the changes in the fair value of the underlying items because the guaranteed return and other cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items do not exceed the fair value return on the underlying items; and
the cash flows that the entity expects to pay to the policyholder do not vary with the changes in the fair value of the underlying items because the guaranteed return and other cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items exceed the fair value return on the underlying items.
The entity's assessment of the variability in paragraph B101(c) for this example will reflect a present value probability-weighted average of all these scenarios.
For insurance contracts with direct participation features, the contractual service margin is adjusted to reflect the variable nature of the fee.
Hence, changes in the amounts set out in paragraph B104 are treated as set out in paragraphs B111-B114.
Changes in the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items (paragraph B104(a)) do not relate to future service and do not adjust the contractual service margin.
Changes in the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items (paragraph B104(b)(i)) relate to future service and adjust the contractual service margin, applying paragraph 45(b).
Changes in the fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items (paragraph B104(b)(ii)) comprise
changes in the fulfilment cash flows other than those specified in (b).
An entity shall apply paragraphs B96-B97, consistent with insurance contracts without direct participation features, to determine to what extent they relate to future service and, applying paragraph 45(c), adjust the contractual service margin.
All the adjustments are measured using current discount rates.
These relate to future service and, applying paragraph 45(c), adjust the contractual service margin, except to the extent that paragraph B115 applies.
To the extent that an entity meets the conditions in paragraph B116, it may choose not to recognise a change in the contractual service margin to reflect some or all of the changes in the effect of financial risk on the entity's share of the underlying items (see paragraph B112) or the fulfilment cash flows set out in paragraph B113(b).
To apply paragraph B115, an entity must have a previously documented risk-management objective and strategy for using derivatives to mitigate financial risk arising from the insurance contracts and, in applying that objective and strategy
the entity uses a derivative to mitigate the financial risk arising from the insurance contracts.
an economic offset exists between the insurance contracts and the derivative, ie the values of the insurance contracts and the derivative generally move in opposite directions because they respond in a similar way to the changes in the risk being mitigated.
An entity shall not consider accounting measurement differences in assessing the economic offset.
credit risk does not dominate the economic offset.
The entity shall determine the fulfilment cash flows in a group to which paragraph B115 applies in a consistent manner in each reporting period.
If any of the conditions in paragraph B116 ceases to be met, an entity shall
cease to apply paragraph B115 from that date; and
not make any adjustment for changes previously recognised in profit or loss.
Recognition of the contractual service margin in profit or loss
An amount of the contractual service margin for a group of insurance contracts is recognised in profit or loss in each period to reflect the services provided under the group of insurance contracts in that period (see paragraphs 44(e), 45(e) and 66(e)).
The amount is determined by
allocating the contractual service margin at the end of the period (before recognising any amounts in profit or loss to reflect the services provided in the period) equally to each coverage unit provided in the current period and expected to be provided in the future.
recognising in profit or loss the amount allocated to coverage units provided in the period.
The total insurance revenue for a group of insurance contracts is the consideration for the contracts, ie the amount of premiums paid to the entity
adjusted for a financing effect; and
The total consideration for a group of contracts covers the following amounts
amounts related to the provision of services, comprising
insurance service expenses, excluding any amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage;
the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, excluding any amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage; and
amounts related to insurance acquisition cash flows.
Applying IFRS 15, when an entity provides services, it derecognises the performance obligation for those services and recognises revenue.
Consistently, applying IFRS 17, when an entity provides services in a period, it reduces the liability for remaining coverage for the services provided and recognises insurance revenue.
The reduction in the liability for remaining coverage that gives rise to insurance revenue excludes changes in the liability that do not relate to services expected to be covered by the consideration received by the entity.
changes that do not relate to services provided in the period, for example
changes resulting from cash inflows from premiums received;
changes that relate to investment components in the period;
(iv) insurance finance income or expenses;
insurance service expenses incurred in the period (measured at the amounts expected at the beginning of the period), excluding
amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage applying paragraph 51(a);
the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, excluding
changes that adjust the contractual service margin because they relate to future service applying paragraphs 44(c) and 45(c); and
(iii) amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage applying paragraph 51(b).
the amount of the contractual service margin recognised in profit or loss in the period, applying paragraphs 44(e) and 45(e).
An entity shall determine insurance revenue related to insurance acquisition cash flows by allocating the portion of the premiums that relate to recovering those cash flows to each reporting period in a systematic way on the basis of the passage of time.
An entity shall recognise the same amount as insurance service expenses.
The entity shall allocate the expected premium receipts to each period of coverage
on the basis of the passage of time; but
if the expected pattern of release of risk during the coverage period differs significantly from the passage of time, then on the basis of the expected timing of incurred insurance service expenses.
An entity shall change the basis of allocation between paragraphs B126(a) and B126(b) as necessary if facts and circumstances change.
assumptions about inflation based on an index of prices or rates or on prices of assets with inflation-linked returns are assumptions that relate to financial risk; and
assumptions about inflation based on an entity's expectation of specific price changes are not assumptions that relate to financial risk.
An entity shall apply its choice of accounting policy to portfolios of insurance contracts.
If paragraph 88(b) applies, an entity shall include in profit or loss an amount determined by a systematic allocation of the expected total finance income or expenses over the duration of the group of insurance contracts.
is based on characteristics of the contracts, without reference to factors that do not affect the cash flows expected to arise under the contracts.
For example, the allocation of the finance income or expenses shall not be based on expected recognised returns on assets if those expected recognised returns do not affect the cash flows of the contracts in the group.
The cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income at any date is the difference between the carrying amount of the group of contracts and the amount that the group would be measured at when applying the systematic allocation.
For groups of insurance contracts for which changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk do not have a substantial effect on the amounts paid to the policyholder, the systematic allocation is determined using the discount rates specified in paragraph B72(e)(i).
For groups of insurance contracts for which changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk have a substantial effect on the amounts paid to the policyholders
using a rate that allocates the remaining revised expected finance income or expenses over the remaining duration of the group of contracts at a constant rate; or
a systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, if separately disaggregated from other changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk applying paragraph 81, is determined using an allocation consistent with that used for the allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the future cash flows.
a systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the contractual service margin is determined
for insurance contracts that do not have direct participation features, using the discount rates specified in paragraph B72(b); and
for insurance contracts with direct participation features, using an allocation consistent with that used for the allocation for the finance income or expenses arising from the future cash flows.
In such cases, it may choose to disaggregate the insurance finance income or expenses applying paragraph 88(b). If the entity makes this choice, it shall determine the insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss using the discount rate specified in paragraph B72(e)(iii).
Hence, an entity might change its accounting policy between that set out in paragraph 88(b) and that set out in paragraph 89(b).
In making such a change an entity shall
include the accumulated amount previously included in other comprehensive income by the date of the change as a reclassification adjustment in profit or loss in the period of change and in future periods, as follows
not restate prior period comparative information.
When applying paragraph B135(a), an entity shall not recalculate the accumulated amount previously included in other comprehensive income as if the new disaggregation had always applied; and the assumptions used for the reclassification in future periods shall not be updated after the date of the change.
For the purposes of the transition requirements in paragraphs C1 and C3-C33
recognise any resulting net difference in equity.
If, and only if, it is impracticable for an entity to apply paragraph C3 for a group of insurance contracts, an entity shall apply the following approaches instead of applying paragraph C4(a)
the modified retrospective approach in paragraphs C6-C19, subject to paragraph C6(a); or
the fair value approach in paragraphs C20-C24.
The objective of the modified retrospective approach is to achieve the closest outcome to retrospective application possible using reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort.
Accordingly, in applying this approach, an entity shall
maximise the use of information that would have been used to apply a fully retrospective approach, but need only use information available without undue cost or effort.
Paragraphs C9-C19 set out permitted modifications to retrospective application in the following areas
assessments of insurance contracts or groups of insurance contracts that would have been made at the date of inception or initial recognition;
amounts related to the contractual service margin or loss component for insurance contracts without direct participation features;
amounts related to the contractual service margin or loss component for insurance contracts with direct participation features; and
To achieve the objective of the modified retrospective approach, an entity is permitted to use each modification in paragraphs C9-C19 only to the extent that an entity does not have reasonable and supportable information to apply a retrospective approach.
Assessments at inception or initial recognition
To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, an entity shall determine the following matters using information available at the transition date
how to identify discretionary cash flows for insurance contracts without direct participation features, applying paragraphs B98-B100.
Determining the contractual service margin or loss component for groups of insurance contracts without direct participation features
To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, an entity shall estimate the future cash flows at the date of initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts as the amount of the future cash flows at the transition date (or earlier date, if the future cash flows at that earlier date can be determined retrospectively, applying paragraph C4(a)), adjusted by the cash flows that are known to have occurred between the date of initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts and the transition date (or earlier date).
The cash flows that are known to have occurred include cash flows resulting from contracts that ceased to exist before the transition date.
To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, an entity shall determine the risk adjustment for non-financial risk at the date of initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts (or subsequently) by adjusting the risk adjustment for non-financial risk at the transition date by the expected release of risk before the transition date.
The expected release of risk shall be determined by reference to the release of risk for similar insurance contracts that the entity issues at the transition date.
If applying paragraphs C12-C14 results in a contractual service margin at the date of initial recognition, to determine the contractual service margin at the date of transition an entity shall
if the entity applies C13 to estimate the discount rates that apply on initial recognition, use those rates to accrete interest on the contractual service margin; and
to the extent permitted by paragraph C8, determine the amount of the contractual service margin recognised in profit or loss because of the transfer of services before the transition date, by comparing the remaining coverage units at that date with the coverage units provided under the group of contracts before the transition date (see paragraph B119).
If applying paragraphs C12-C14 results in a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage at the date of initial recognition, an entity shall determine any amounts allocated to the loss component before the transition date applying paragraphs C12-C14 and using a systematic basis of allocation.
Determining the contractual service margin or loss component for groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features
To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, for contracts with direct participation features an entity shall determine the contractual service margin or loss component of the liability for remaining coverage at the transition date as
the fulfilment cash flows at that date; plus or minus
amounts charged by the entity to the policyholders (including amounts deducted from the underlying items) before that date.
amounts paid before that date that would not have varied based on the underlying items.
The total of (a)-(c) is a proxy for the total contractual service margin for all services to be provided under the group of contracts, ie before any amounts that would have been recognised in profit or loss for services provided.
The entity shall estimate the amounts that would have been recognised in profit or loss for services provided by comparing the remaining coverage units at the transition date with the coverage units provided under the group of contracts before the transition date; or
an entity is permitted to determine the discount rates at the date of initial recognition of a group specified in paragraphs B72(b)-B72(e)(ii) and the discount rates at the date of the incurred claim specified in paragraph B72(e)(iii) at the transition date instead of at the date of initial recognition or incurred claim.
The entity is permitted to determine that cumulative amount either by applying paragraph C19(b) or
as nil, unless (ii) applies; and
for insurance contracts with direct participation features to which paragraph B134 applies, as equal to the cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income on the underlying items.
if an entity applies paragraph C13 to estimate the discount rates that applied at initial recognition (or subsequently), it shall also determine the discount rates specified in paragraphs B72(b)-B72(e) applying paragraph C13; and
The entity shall determine that cumulative amount
for insurance contracts for which an entity will apply the methods of systematic allocation set out in paragraph B132 -- on the basis that the assumptions that relate to financial risk that applied at the date of initial recognition are those that apply on the transition date, ie as nil;
(iv) for insurance contracts with direct participation features to which paragraph B134 applies -- as equal to the cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income on the underlying items.
To apply the fair value approach, an entity shall determine the contractual service margin or loss component of the liability for remaining coverage at the transition date as the difference between the fair value of a group of insurance contracts at that date and the fulfilment cash flows measured at that date.
In applying the fair value approach, an entity may apply paragraph C22 to determine
An entity may choose to determine the matters in paragraph C21 using
reasonable and supportable information for what the entity would have determined given the terms of the contract and the market conditions at the date of inception or initial recognition, as appropriate; or
reasonable and supportable information available at the transition date.
In applying the fair value approach, if an entity chooses to disaggregate insurance finance income or expenses between profit or loss and other comprehensive income, it is permitted to determine the cumulative amount of insurance finance income or expenses recognised in other comprehensive income at the transition date
as nil -- unless (c) applies; and
for insurance contracts with direct participation features to which paragraph B134 applies -- as equal to the cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income from the underlying items.
If an entity presents unadjusted comparative information and disclosures for any earlier periods, it shall clearly identify the information that has not been adjusted, disclose that it has been prepared on a different basis, and explain that basis.
However, if an entity does not disclose that information, it shall disclose that fact.
An entity shall apply those designations and classifications retrospectively.
An entity that applies paragraph C29 is not required to restate prior periods to reflect such changes in designations or classifications.
If an entity does not restate prior periods, the entity shall recognise, in the opening retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at the date of initial application, any difference between
the previous carrying amount of those financial assets; and
the carrying amount of those financial assets at the date of initial application.
When an entity applies paragraph C29, it shall disclose in that annual reporting period for those financial assets by class
if paragraph C29(a) applies -- its basis for determining eligible financial assets;
if any of paragraphs C29(a)-C29(e) apply
the new measurement category and carrying amount of the affected financial assets determined after applying paragraph C29.
When an entity applies paragraph C29, the entity shall disclose in that annual reporting period qualitative information that would enable users of financial statements to understand
After paragraph B12, a heading and paragraph B13 are added.
Exceptions to the retrospective application of other IFRSs
An entity shall apply the following exceptions
government loans (paragraphs B10-B12); and
In Appendix D, paragraph D1 is amended and paragraph D4 and its related heading are deleted.
The acquirer shall classify those contracts on the basis of the contractual terms and other factors at the inception of the contract (or, if the terms of the contract have been modified in a manner that would change its classification, at the date of that modification, which might be the acquisition date).
Exceptions to the recognition or measurement principles
In Appendix B, paragraph B63 is amended.
Other IFRSs that provide guidance on subsequent measurement and accounting (application of paragraph 54)
However, this IFRS applies to
when the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value, for example, for financial instruments such as short-term trade receivables and payables; or
Similarly, some entities issue groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features and those entities hold the underlying items.
Some such funds or underlying items include the entity's financial liability (for example, a corporate bond issued).
Despite the other requirements in this Standard for the derecognition of financial liabilities, an entity may elect not to derecognise its financial liability that is included in such a fund or is an underlying item when, and only when, the entity repurchases its financial liability for such purposes.
Instead, the entity may elect to continue to account for that instrument as a financial liability and to account for the repurchased instrument as if the instrument were a financial asset, and measure it at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with this Standard.
That election is irrevocable and made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
Some contracts require a payment based on climatic, geological or other physical variables.
Financial guarantee contracts may have various legal forms, such as a guarantee, some types of letter of credit, a credit default contract or an insurance contract.
Their accounting treatment does not depend on their legal form.
An example of such a guarantee is one that requires payments in response to changes in a specified credit rating or credit index.
Such guarantees are derivatives and the issuer applies this Standard to them.
In Appendix C, paragraph C1C is added.
Other comprehensive income comprises items of income and expense (including reclassification adjustments) that are not recognised in profit or loss as required or permitted by other IFRS.
The components of other comprehensive income include
Information to be presented in the statement of financial position
Information to be presented in the profit or loss section or the statement of profit or loss
interest revenue calculated using the effective interest method; and
insurance revenue (see IFRS 17);
(ac) income or expenses from reinsurance contracts held (see IFRS 17);
(bc) finance income or expenses from reinsurance contracts held (see IFRS 17);
Therefore, they generally result from the transactions and other events that enter into the determination of profit or loss.
Examples of cash flows from operating activities are
Some entities operate, either internally or externally, an investment fund that provides investors with benefits determined by units in the fund.
Similarly, some entities issue groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features and hold the underlying items.
Some such funds or underlying items include owner-occupied property.
An entity shall treat owner-occupied property measured using the investment property fair value model applying paragraph 29A as a separate class of property, plant and equipment.
An example of an investment-linked insurance fund is a fund held by an entity as the underlying items for a group of insurance contracts with direct participation features.
Treasury shares (see also paragraph AG36)
Some entities operate, either internally or externally, an investment fund that provides investors with benefits determined by units in the fund and recognise financial liabilities for the amounts to be paid to those investors.
Some such funds or underlying items include the entity's treasury shares.
In the Application Guidance, paragraphs AG8 and AG36, and the heading preceding paragraph AG36 are amended.
Financial assets and financial liabilities
The ability to exercise a contractual right or the requirement to satisfy a contractual obligation may be absolute, or it may be contingent on the occurrence of a future event.
For example, a financial guarantee is a contractual right of the lender to receive cash from the guarantor, and a corresponding contractual obligation of the guarantor to pay the lender, if the borrower defaults.
The contractual right and obligation exist because of a past transaction or event (assumption of the guarantee), even though the lender's ability to exercise its right and the requirement for the guarantor to perform under its obligation are both contingent on a future act of default by the borrower.
A contingent right and obligation meet the definition of a financial asset and a financial liability, even though such assets and liabilities are not always recognised in the financial statements.
An entity's own equity instruments are not recognised as a financial asset regardless of the reason for which they are reacquired.
However, when an entity holds its own equity on behalf of others, eg a financial institution holding its own equity on behalf of a client, there is an agency relationship and as a result those holdings are not included in the entity's statement of financial position.
Transition provisions and effective date
For example, some types of provisions are addressed in Standards on
For example, this Standard does not apply to
Transitional provisions and effective date
Similarly, some entities issue insurance contracts with direct participation features, for which the underlying items include investment property.
Paragraph 32A does not permit an entity to measure property held by the fund (or property that is an underlying item) partly at cost and partly at fair value.
The effective date paragraph is amended.

may estimate the fulfilment cash flows at a higher level of aggregation than the group, provided the entity is able to include the appropriate fulfilment cash flows in the measurement of the group by allocating such estimates to groups of contracts.
Key features of accounting for groups of insurance contracts
This example illustrates how an entity measures a group of insurance contracts on initial recognition that is onerous on initial recognition, and a group of insurance contracts that is not onerous on initial recognition.
The coverage period starts when the insurance contracts are issued.
It is assumed, for simplicity, that no contracts will lapse before the end of the coverage period.
In this example all other amounts are ignored, for simplicity.
The measurement of the group of insurance contracts on initial recognition is as follows
Estimates of the present value of future cash inflows
Estimates of the present value of future cash outflows
Estimates of the present value of future cash flows
The effect on profit or loss on initial recognition is as follows
Insurance contract (asset) / liability immediately after initial recognition
This example illustrates how an entity subsequently measures a group of insurance contracts, including a situation when the group of insurance contracts becomes onerous after initial recognition.
On initial recognition, the entity measures the group of insurance contracts and estimates the fulfilment cash flows at the end of each subsequent year as follows
Insurance contract (asset) / liability on initial recognition
Risk adjustment for non- financial risk
Changes related to current service
Changes related to future service
The amounts recognised in the statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss summarise the amounts analysed in the tables above as follows
Changes related to future service: loss on onerous group of contracts
This example illustrates how an entity could present the insurance service result, comprising insurance revenue minus insurance service expenses, in the statement of profit or loss.
This change is only related to incurred claims and does not affect the investment component.
The amounts presented in the statement of profit or loss corresponding to the amounts analysed in the tables above are
Liability for remaining coverage, excluding loss component
Loss component of the liability for remaining coverage
An entity issues a life insurance contract with an account balance.
The contract promises to pay the following
the account balance, if the contract is cancelled (ie there are no surrender charges).
The entity has a claims processing department to process the claims received and an asset management department to manage investments.
An investment product that has equivalent terms to the account balance, but without the insurance coverage, is sold by another financial institution.
The entity considers whether to separate the non-insurance components from the insurance contract.
The existence of an investment product with equivalent terms indicates that the components may be distinct, applying paragraph B31(b).
However, if the right to death benefits provided by the insurance coverage either lapses or matures at the same time as the account balance, the insurance and investment components are highly interrelated and are therefore not distinct, applying paragraph B32(b).
Claims processing activities are part of the activities the entity must undertake to fulfil the contract, and the entity does not transfer a good or service to the policyholder because the entity performs those activities.
Thus, applying paragraph B33, the entity would not separate the claims processing component from the insurance contract.
Separating the asset management component
The asset management activities, similarly to claims processing activities, are part of the activities the entity must undertake to fulfil the contract, and the entity does not transfer a good or service to the policyholder because the entity performs those activities.
Thus, applying paragraph B33, the entity would not separate the asset management component from the insurance contract.
An entity issues a stop-loss contract to an employer (the policyholder).
The contract provides health coverage for the policyholder's employees and has the following features
The entity is responsible for processing the health insurance claims of the employees on behalf of the employer.
The entity considers whether to separate the claims processing services.
The entity notes that similar services to process claims on behalf of customers are sold on the market.
Separating the claims processing services
The criteria for identifying distinct non-insurance services in paragraph B34 are met in this example
the claims processing services, similar to the services to process the employees' claims on behalf of the employer, are sold as a standalone service without any insurance coverage; and
the claims processing services benefit the policyholder independently of the insurance coverage.
Had the entity not agreed to provide those services, the policyholder would have to process its employees' medical claims itself or engage other service providers to do this.
Additionally, the criteria in paragraph B35 that establishes if the service is not distinct are not met because the cash flows associated with the claims processing services are not highly interrelated with the cash flows associated with the insurance coverage, and the entity does not provide a significant service of integrating the claims processing services with the insurance components.
In addition, the entity could provide the promised claims processing services separately from the insurance coverage.
This example illustrates adjustments to the contractual service margin of insurance contracts without direct participation features for
the changes in discretionary cash flows for insurance contracts that give an entity discretion over the cash flows expected to be paid to the policyholder, including determination of changes in those cash flows separately from changes in financial assumptions;
the adjustments related to the time value of money and financial risks in a situation when the interest rate changes; and
the amount recognised in profit or loss for the services provided in the period in a situation when the entity expects contracts in a group to have different durations.
The contracts in this example
meet the definition of insurance contracts because they offer a fixed payment on death.
Policyholders will receive the value of the account balance
if the insured person dies during the coverage period; or
at the end of the coverage period (maturity value) if the insured person survives to the end of the coverage period.
premiums received at the beginning of the period (if any); minus
the value of the remaining account balances paid to policyholders when an insured person dies or the coverage period ends.
On initial recognition of the group of contracts, the entity
An entity uses this specification to distinguish between the effect of changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk on that commitment (which does not adjust the contractual service margin) and the effect of discretionary changes to that commitment (which adjusts the contractual service margin).
As expected on initial recognition
Applying paragraphs B98-B99, the entity distinguishes between the effect of changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk and the effect of discretionary changes on the fulfilment cash flows as follows
The effect of changes in financial assumptions (and interest accretion)
This example illustrates the determination of insurance acquisition cash flows on initial recognition and the subsequent determination of insurance revenue, including the portion of premium related to the recovery of the insurance acquisition cash flows.
On initial recognition, the entity determines the following
estimates of future cash outflows, which comprise
In this example for simplicity, it is assumed that
all expenses are incurred as expected;
no contracts will lapse during the coverage period;
there is no investment component; and
all other amounts, including the effect of discounting, are ignored for simplicity.
The entity recognises the following amounts in profit or loss
Amounts relating to the changes in the liability for remaining coverage
Contractual service margin recognised in profit or loss
Change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk caused by the release from risk
Allocation of recovery of insurance acquisition cash flows
This example illustrates how, for an onerous group of insurance contracts, an entity reverses losses from the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage when the group becomes profitable.
The entity expects claims will be paid when incurred.
In this example all other amounts, including the investment component are ignored, for simplicity.
The risk adjustment for non-financial risk related to those cash flows remains unchanged.
Insurance service expenses: loss on onerous contracts
Insurance service expenses: incurred expenses
Applying paragraph 50(a), the entity allocates specified subsequent changes in fulfilment cash flows of the liability for remaining coverage on a systematic basis between the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage and the liability for remaining coverage excluding the loss component.
Insurance service expenses: reversal of loss on onerous contracts
Measurement of groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features
This example illustrates the measurement of groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features.
the value of the account balance at the end of the coverage period if the insured person survives until the end of the coverage period.
premiums received (if any); plus
the change in fair value of a specified pool of assets; minus
the value of the remaining account balance when the insured person dies or the coverage period ends.
The entity purchases the specified pool of assets and measures the assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Hence, the assets that the entity holds equal the underlying items.
On initial recognition of the contracts, the entity
During the coverage period, there are changes in the fair value returns on underlying items, as follows
calculate the fair value of the underlying items in which the policyholders participate to adjust the contractual service margin for those changes; and
analyse the changes in fulfilment cash flows to decide whether each change adjusts the contractual service margin.
The entity determines the fair value of the underlying items at the end of each reporting period as follows
(a) (the policyholder account balances)
Cash outflows: payments on maturity of contracts
The entity determines the changes in the fulfilment cash flows as follows
change in the fair value of the underlying items
The amounts recognised in the statement of profit or loss for the period are as follows
Measurement of groups of insurance contracts using the premium allocation approach
This example illustrates the premium allocation approach for simplifying the measurement of the groups of insurance contracts.
On initial recognition the entity expects
to incur claims and be released from risk evenly over the coverage period; and
that no contracts will lapse during the coverage period.
all other amounts, including the investment component, are ignored for simplicity.
immediately after initial recognition the entity receives all the premiums and pays all the acquisition cash flows;
for simplicity, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk related to the claims incurred is recognised in profit or loss when the claims are paid.
The group of insurance contracts qualifies for the premium allocation approach applying paragraph 53(b).
In addition, the entity expects that
Consequently, applying paragraph 59(b), the entity chooses not to adjust the liability for incurred claims for the time value of money and the effect of financial risk.
Further, applying paragraph 59(a), the entity chooses to recognise the insurance acquisition cash flows as an expense when it incurs the relevant costs.
The effect of the group of insurance contracts on the statement of financial position is as follows
between the amounts recognised in the statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss separately for the liability for remaining coverage and the liability for incurred claims; and
of the liability for incurred claims, disclosing a separate reconciliation for the estimates of the present value of the future cash flows and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.
The amounts included in the statement of profit or loss are as follows
Measurement of groups of reinsurance contracts held
This example illustrates the measurement on initial recognition of a group of reinsurance contracts that an entity holds.
The entity measures the underlying group of insurance contracts on initial recognition as follows
In this example the risk of non-performance of the reinsurer and all other amounts are ignored, for simplicity.
The measurement of the reinsurance contract held is as follows
Estimates of the present value of future cash inflows (recoveries)
Estimates of the present value of future cash outflows (premium paid)
Reinsurance contract asset on initial recognition
The effect on profit or loss will be
This example illustrates the subsequent measurement of the contractual service margin arising from a reinsurance contract held, when the underlying group of insurance contracts is not onerous and, separately, when the underlying group of insurance contracts is onerous.
In this example the effect of discounting, the risk of non-performance of the reinsurer and other amounts are ignored, for simplicity.
Fulfilment cash flows (before the effect of any change in estimates)
Fulfilment cash flows (including the effect of the change in estimates)
The effect of the change in estimates on profit or loss will be
Example 12B -- Underlying group of insurance contracts is onerous
This example illustrates the initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts acquired in a transfer that is not a business combination.
An entity acquires insurance contracts in a transfer from another entity.
The entity does not apply the premium allocation approach to the measurement of the insurance contracts.
Applying paragraph B94, the consideration received from the seller is a proxy for the premium received.
Consequently, on initial recognition, the entity measures the insurance contract liability as follows
Insurance contract liability on initial recognition
This example illustrates the initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts acquired in a business combination.
An entity acquires insurance contracts as part of a business combination and it
Applying paragraph B94, the fair value of the group of insurance contracts is a proxy for the premium received.
Consequently, on initial recognition, the entity measures the liability for the group of insurance contracts as follows
do not meet the criteria for insurance contracts with direct participation features applying paragraph B101.
On initial recognition of the group of insurance contracts
This amount is calculated on the basis of the entity's policy for the return paid to the policyholders, as follows
In this example all other amounts, including the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, are ignored for simplicity.
in Example 15B, the entity uses an allocation based on the amounts credited in the period and expected to be credited in future periods, applying paragraph B132(a)(ii).
Consequently, the entity revises its expectations about future cash flows as follows
The effect of the change in discount rates on the carrying amounts of the estimates of the present value of the future cash flows, included in the carrying amount of the insurance contract liability, is shown in the table below
Estimates of the present value of future cash flows at current discount rates (A)
Estimates of the present value of future cash flows at the constant rate (B)
Amount accumulated in other comprehensive income (A - B)
The insurance finance income and expenses, arising from the fulfilment cash flows, included in profit or loss and other comprehensive income are as follows
Insurance finance income and expenses arising from the fulfilment cash flows
Applying paragraph B132(a)(ii), the entity uses an allocation based on the amounts credited in the period and expected to be credited in future periods (a 'projected crediting rate approach').
In order to do so, the entity calculates a series of discount rates applicable to each reporting period which, when applied to the initial carrying amount of the liability equals the estimate of future cash flows.
This series of discount rates is calculated by multiplying the expected crediting rates in each period by a constant factor (K).
Consequently, the entity revises its expectations about cash flows as follows
The entity allocates the remaining expected finance income or expenses over the remaining life of the contracts using the series of discount rates calculated as the projected crediting rates multiplied by the constant factor (K).
Estimates of the present value of future cash flows at discount rates based on projected crediting (B)
The insurance finance income and expenses included in profit or loss and other comprehensive income are as follows
Insurance finance income and expenses arising from fulfilment cash flows
This approach applies when an entity holds the underlying items for insurance contracts with direct participation features.
meet criteria for insurance contracts with direct participation features applying paragraph B101.
For simplicity, this example excludes the effect of accounting for expected credit losses on financial assets.
The value of the bonds held by the entity is illustrated in the table below
Cumulative amounts recognised in other comprehensive income
Change in other comprehensive income
Investment income recognised in profit or loss (effective interest rate)
Applying paragraphs B110-B114, the entity analyses the source of changes in the fulfilment cash flows as follows
Change related to current service: recognition in profit or loss for the service provided
Gain / (loss) on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Gain / (loss) on insurance contracts
This example illustrates the transition requirements for insurance contracts without direct participation features for which retrospective application is impracticable and an entity chooses to apply the modified retrospective transition approach.
An entity issues insurance contracts without direct participation features and aggregates those contracts into a group applying paragraphs C9(a) and C10.
As a result, the entity chooses, applying paragraph C5, to apply the modified retrospective approach to measure the contractual service margin at the transition date.
Applying paragraph C6(a), the entity uses reasonable and supportable information to achieve the closest outcome to retrospective application.
The entity determines the contractual service margin at the transition date by estimating the fulfilment cash flows on initial recognition applying paragraphs C12-C15 as follows
This example illustrates the transition requirements for insurance contracts with direct participation features when retrospective application is impracticable and an entity chooses to apply the modified retrospective transition approach.
a policyholder will receive an amount equal to the higher of the account balance and the minimum death benefit if an insured person dies during the coverage period.
if an insured person survives the coverage period, the policyholder receives the value of the account balance.
The entity makes the following estimates
The entity applies a modified retrospective approach to determine the contractual service margin at the transition date, applying paragraph C17 as follows
Fair value of the underlying items at the transition date (paragraph C17(a))
Fulfilment cash flows at the transition date (paragraph C17(b))
Charges deducted from underlying items before the transition date (paragraph C17(c)(i))
Amounts paid before the transition date that would have not varied based on the returns on underlying items (paragraph C17(c)(ii))
Estimated change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk caused by the release from risk before the transition date (paragraph C17(c)(iii))
Contractual service margin of the group of contracts before recognition in profit or loss
Estimated amount of the contractual service margin that relates to services provided before the transition date
Estimated contractual service margin at the transition date
Applying paragraph 16(a), the entity will group those contracts separately from contracts that are not onerous.
That rate is applicable to nominal cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on any underlying items, determined on initial recognition of the group of insurance contracts.
The entity allocates the contractual service margin at the end of the period (before recognising any amounts in profit or loss) equally to each coverage unit provided in the current period and expected to be provided in the future, and recognises in profit or loss the amount allocated to the coverage units provided in the period.
The entity could achieve the objective of the recognition of the contractual service margin on the basis of the coverage units using a different pattern.
For example, the entity could allocate equally in each period the contractual service margin including the total interest expected to be accreted over the coverage period.
Applying paragraph 104, the entity classifies those changes as related to current service.
For simplicity, there is no interest accreted on the cash account.
The whole amount of insurance finance expenses is related to the liability for remaining coverage because the liability for incurred claims is paid immediately after the expenses are incurred.
(i) determined by the entity applying paragraph B123 as the change in the liability for remaining coverage, excluding
The loss component determines the amounts presented in profit or loss as reversals of losses on onerous groups that are consequently excluded from determination of insurance revenue.
Consequently, the entity allocates subsequent changes in fulfilment cash flows to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage as follows
(b) See the table after paragraph IE69.
Hence, it reflects only the change in financial assumptions.
This is because such changes do not relate to future service.
That rate is applicable to nominal cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on any underlying items.
The amount recognised in each period is determined by the allocation of the contractual service margin remaining at the end of the reporting period (before any allocation) over the current and remaining coverage periods.
In this example, the coverage provided in each period is the same because the number of contracts for which the coverage is provided in each period is the same.
The entity recognises the same amount as insurance service expenses.
(a) See the table after paragraph IE80 for more details on the components of insurance revenue.
(c) Other expenses include acquisition cash flows that are not directly attributable to the portfolio of insurance contracts to which the contracts belong.
The loss component determines the amounts presented in profit or loss as reversals of losses on onerous groups that are consequently excluded from the determination of insurance revenue.
See the table after paragraph IE93 and footnotes to that table for the calculation.
(c) See the table after paragraph IE91 for the calculation.
Consequently, the entity allocates subsequent changes in the fulfilment cash flows to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage as follows
(i) determined by the entity applying paragraph B123, as the change in the liability for remaining coverage, excluding
See the table after paragraph IE96 and footnotes to that table for more detailed calculations.
(b) See the table after paragraph IE94 for the calculation.
This example illustrates the result of making the allocation required by paragraph 50(a) before the allocation required by paragraph 50(b).
(b) See the table after paragraph IE97 for the calculation.
The estimates of the present value of the future cash outflows include an estimate of the time value of the guarantee inherent in providing a minimum death benefit, measured consistently with observable market prices for the guarantee.
(a) In this example, the underlying items equal the assets the entity holds.
(a) The effect of the time value of money and financial risks and the changes therein includes
(a) Applying paragraphs B110-B113, the entity adjusts the contractual service margin for the net of changes in
(i) the entity's share in the fair value of the underlying items; and
(ii) the fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items related to future service, determined applying paragraph B96, plus the effect of the time value of money and financial risks and changes therein not arising from the underlying items.
In addition, in this example there are no changes in the fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items determined applying paragraph B96.
Consequently, the entity could estimate the net adjustment to the contractual service margin as the net of changes in
(iii) the fair value of the underlying items (equals (i) plus the obligation to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items); and
(iv) the fulfilment cash flows related to the effect of the time value of money and financial risks and the changes therein (equals (ii) plus the obligation to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items).
Consequently, in this example, the adjustment to the contractual service margin for changes related to future service is the net of the change in fair value of the underlying items and changes in the fulfilment cash flows related to the effect of the time value of money and financial risks and the changes therein.
(a) The detailed description of the method of the calculation of the insurance revenue is provided in the table after paragraph IE33.
In this example, total insurance revenue equals the total charges deducted from the policyholder account balances.
(a) See the table after paragraph IE123 for the calculation of insurance revenue.
The entity does not include acquisition cash flows in the liability for remaining coverage because it chooses to expense them when incurred applying paragraph 59(a).
(a) Applying paragraph B126, the entity recognises insurance revenue for the period as the amount of expected premium receipts allocated to the period.
In this example, the expected premium receipts are allocated to each period of coverage on the basis of the passage of time because the expected pattern of the release of risk during the coverage period does not differ significantly from the passage of time.
This is because the whole change in the fulfilment cash flows allocated to the group of underlying insurance contracts adjusts the contractual service margin of those underlying insurance contracts.
(c) The entity recognises in total comprehensive income the change in estimates of the present value of the future cash flows at the current discount rate.
Applying paragraph B111, the entity does not adjust the contractual service margin for the change in the obligation to pay policyholders an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items because it does not relate to future service.
(a) Applying paragraph B112, the entity adjusts the contractual service margin for the change in the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items because those changes relate to future service.
This example does not include cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items.
The remaining amount of insurance finance expenses is recognised in other comprehensive income.
(a) Applying paragraph C12, the entity estimates the future cash flows at the date of initial recognition of the group of insurance contracts to be the sum of
This amount includes cash flows resulting from contracts that ceased to exist before the transition date.
Applying paragraph C14, the entity determines the expected release of risk by reference to the release of risk for similar insurance contracts that the entity issues at the transition date.

the special problems arising in accounting for government grants in financial statements reflecting the effects of changing prices or in supplementary information of a similar nature.
government participation in the ownership of the entity.
Government assistance is action by government designed to provide an economic benefit specific to an entity or range of entities qualifying under certain criteria.
Government assistance for the purpose of this Standard does not include benefits provided only indirectly through action affecting general trading conditions, such as the provision of infrastructure in development areas or the imposition of trading constraints on competitors.
Government grants are assistance by government in the form of transfers of resources to an entity in return for past or future compliance with certain conditions relating to the operating activities of the entity.
They exclude those forms of government assistance which cannot reasonably have a value placed upon them and transactions with government which cannot be distinguished from the normal trading transactions of the entity.
Grants related to assets are government grants whose primary condition is that an entity qualifying for them should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire long-term assets.
Subsidiary conditions may also be attached restricting the type or location of the assets or the periods during which they are to be acquired or held.
Grants related to income are government grants other than those related to assets.
Forgivable loans are loans which the lender undertakes to waive repayment of under certain prescribed conditions.
The purpose of the assistance may be to encourage an entity to embark on a course of action which it would not normally have taken if the assistance was not provided.
This facilitates comparison of an entity's financial statements with those of prior periods and with those of other entities.
Receipt of a grant does not of itself provide conclusive evidence that the conditions attaching to the grant have been or will be fulfilled.
Thus a grant is accounted for in the same manner whether it is received in cash or as a reduction of a liability to the government.
The benefit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant.
The benefit is accounted for in accordance with this Standard.
The entity shall consider the conditions and obligations that have been, or must be, met when identifying the costs for which the benefit of the loan is intended to compensate.
government grants are a financing device and should be dealt with as such in the statement of financial position rather than be recognised in profit or loss to offset the items of expense that they finance.
Because no repayment is expected, such grants should be recognised outside profit or loss.
it is inappropriate to recognise government grants in profit or loss, because they are not earned but represent an incentive provided by government without related costs.
because government grants are receipts from a source other than shareholders, they should not be recognised directly in equity but should be recognised in profit or loss in appropriate periods.
government grants are rarely gratuitous.
The entity earns them through compliance with their conditions and meeting the envisaged obligations.
They should therefore be recognised in profit or loss over the periods in which the entity recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate.
because income and other taxes are expenses, it is logical to deal also with government grants, which are an extension of fiscal policies, in profit or loss.
Thus grants in recognition of specific expenses are recognised in profit or loss in the same period as the relevant expenses.
Similarly, grants related to depreciable assets are usually recognised in profit or loss over the periods and in the proportions in which depreciation expense on those assets is recognised.
As an example, a grant of land may be conditional upon the erection of a building on the site and it may be appropriate to recognise the grant in profit or loss over the life of the building.
In such cases, care is needed in identifying the conditions giving rise to costs and expenses which determine the periods over which the grant will be earned.
Such grants may be confined to a particular entity and may not be available to a whole class of beneficiaries.
Such a grant is recognised in profit or loss of the period in which it becomes receivable, with disclosure to ensure that its effect is clearly understood.
In these circumstances it is usual to assess the fair value of the non-monetary asset and to account for both grant and asset at that fair value.
An alternative course that is sometimes followed is to record both asset and grant at a nominal amount.
The grant is recognised in profit or loss over the life of a depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense.
For this reason and in order to show the gross investment in assets, such movements are often disclosed as separate items in the statement of cash flows regardless of whether or not the grant is deducted from the related asset for presentation purposes in the statement of financial position.
Disclosure of the grant may be necessary for a proper understanding of the financial statements.
Disclosure of the effect of the grants on any item of income or expense which is required to be separately disclosed is usually appropriate.
To the extent that the repayment exceeds any such deferred credit, or when no deferred credit exists, the repayment shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Repayment of a grant related to an asset shall be recognised by increasing the carrying amount of the asset or reducing the deferred income balance by the amount repayable.
The cumulative additional depreciation that would have been recognised in profit or loss to date in the absence of the grant shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss.
An example of assistance that cannot be distinguished from the normal trading transactions of the entity is a government procurement policy that is responsible for a portion of the entity's sales.
The existence of the benefit might be unquestioned but any attempt to segregate the trading activities from government assistance could well be arbitrary.

unfulfilled conditions and other contingencies attaching to government assistance that has been recognised.

Borrowing costs are interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale.
exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.
Financial assets, and inventories that are manufactured, or otherwise produced, over a short period of time, are not qualifying assets.
Assets that are ready for their intended use or sale when acquired are not qualifying assets.
An entity shall recognise other borrowing costs as an expense in the period in which it incurs them.
Such borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably.
When an entity borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a particular qualifying asset, the borrowing costs that directly relate to that qualifying asset can be readily identified.
Such a difficulty occurs, for example, when the financing activity of an entity is co-ordinated centrally.
Difficulties also arise when a group uses a range of debt instruments to borrow funds at varying rates of interest, and lends those funds on various bases to other entities in the group.
Other complications arise through the use of loans denominated in or linked to foreign currencies, when the group operates in highly inflationary economies, and from fluctuations in exchange rates.
As a result, the determination of the amount of borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of a qualifying asset is difficult and the exercise of judgement is required.
In such circumstances, the funds are often temporarily invested pending their expenditure on the qualifying asset.
In determining the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation during a period, any investment income earned on such funds is deducted from the borrowing costs incurred.
The capitalisation rate shall be the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to all borrowings of the entity that are outstanding during the period.
However, an entity shall exclude from this calculation borrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset until substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.
The amount of borrowing costs that an entity capitalises during a period shall not exceed the amount of borrowing costs it incurred during that period.
In certain circumstances, the amount of the write-down or write-off is written back in accordance with those other Standards.
it incurs expenditures for the asset;
it undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale.
The average carrying amount of the asset during a period, including borrowing costs previously capitalised, is normally a reasonable approximation of the expenditures to which the capitalisation rate is applied in that period.
They include technical and administrative work prior to the commencement of physical construction, such as the activities associated with obtaining permits prior to the commencement of the physical construction.
However, such activities exclude the holding of an asset when no production or development that changes the asset's condition is taking place.
For example, borrowing costs incurred while land is under development are capitalised during the period in which activities related to the development are being undertaken.
However, borrowing costs incurred while land acquired for building purposes is held without any associated development activity do not qualify for capitalisation.
Such costs are costs of holding partially completed assets and do not qualify for capitalisation.
However, an entity does not normally suspend capitalising borrowing costs during a period when it carries out substantial technical and administrative work.
An entity also does not suspend capitalising borrowing costs when a temporary delay is a necessary part of the process of getting an asset ready for its intended use or sale.
For example, capitalisation continues during the extended period that high water levels delay construction of a bridge, if such high water levels are common during the construction period in the geographical region involved.
If minor modifications, such as the decoration of a property to the purchaser's or user's specification, are all that are outstanding, this indicates that substantially all the activities are complete.
An example of a qualifying asset that needs to be complete before any part can be used is an industrial plant involving several processes which are carried out in sequence at different parts of the plant within the same site, such as a steel mill.

It does not apply when, for example, an entity
stops presenting financial statements in accordance with national requirements, having previously presented them as well as another set of financial statements that contained an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRSs;
Such changes are the subject of

The resulting adjustments arise from events and transactions before the date of transition to IFRSs.
Therefore, an entity shall recognise those adjustments directly in retained earnings (or, if appropriate, another category of equity) at the date of transition to IFRSs.
The entity shall not reflect that new information in its opening IFRS statement of financial position (unless the estimates need adjustment for any differences in accounting policies or there is objective evidence that the estimates were in error).
To achieve consistency with IAS 10, those estimates in accordance with IFRSs shall reflect conditions that existed at the date of transition to IFRSs.
In particular, estimates at the date of transition to IFRSs of market prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates shall reflect market conditions at that date.
They also apply to a comparative period presented in an entity's first IFRS financial statements, in which case the references to the date of transition to IFRSs are replaced by references to the end of that comparative period.
This IFRS does not require such summaries to comply with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRSs.
In any financial statements containing historical summaries or comparative information in accordance with previous GAAP, an entity shall

An entity need not quantify those adjustments.
An entity that has applied IFRSs in a previous period, as described in paragraph 4A, shall disclose
the reason it stopped applying IFRSs; and

When determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, an entity may apply
If, at the date of transition to IFRSs, determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the initial recognition of a financial instrument would require undue cost or effort, an entity shall recognise a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date until that financial instrument is derecognised (unless that financial instrument is low credit risk at a reporting date, in which case paragraph B8F(a) applies).
The requirements and guidance in paragraphs B10 and B11 do not preclude an entity from being able to use the exemptions described in paragraphs D19–D19C relating to the designation of previously recognised financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
An entity shall apply the following requirements to business combinations that the entity recognised before the date of transition to IFRSs.

Instead, the acquirer shall recognise and measure it in its consolidated statement of financial position on the basis that IFRSs would require in the statement of financial position of the acquiree.

Some entities hold items of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets or intangible assets that are used, or were previously used, in operations subject to rate regulation.

Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments
If an entity has a functional currency that was, or is, the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, it shall determine whether it was subject to severe hyperinflation before the date of transition to IFRSs.
The currency of a hyperinflationary economy is subject to severe hyperinflation if it has both of the following characteristics
The functional currency of an entity ceases to be subject to severe hyperinflation on the functional currency normalisation date.
That is the date when the functional currency no longer has either, or both, of the characteristics in paragraph D27, or when there is a change in the entity's functional currency to a currency that is not subject to severe hyperinflation.
When an entity's date of transition to IFRSs is on, or after, the functional currency normalisation date, the entity may elect to measure all assets and liabilities held before the functional currency normalisation date at fair value on the date of transition to IFRSs.
The entity may use that fair value as the deemed cost of those assets and liabilities in the opening IFRS statement of financial position.
Any resulting impairment shall be recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings at the date of transition to IFRS.

financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies
Gain or loss on net monetary position
Selection and use of the general price index
Money loses purchasing power at such a rate that comparison of amounts from transactions and other events that have occurred at different times, even within the same accounting period, is misleading.
It is a matter of judgement when restatement of financial statements in accordance with this Standard becomes necessary.
Hyperinflation is indicated by characteristics of the economic environment of a country which include, but are not limited to, the following
the general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency.
Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power;
the general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency.
Prices may be quoted in that currency;
sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;
Nevertheless, this Standard applies to the financial statements of any entity from the beginning of the reporting period in which it identifies the existence of hyperinflation in the country in whose currency it reports.
Specific forces such as changes in supply and demand and technological changes may cause individual prices to increase or decrease significantly and independently of each other.
In addition, general forces may result in changes in the general level of prices and therefore in the general purchasing power of money.
For example, property, plant and equipment may be revalued to fair value and biological assets are generally required to be measured at fair value.
Some entities, however, present financial statements that are based on a current cost approach that reflects the effects of changes in the specific prices of assets held.
As a result, this Standard applies to the financial statements of entities reporting in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy.
Presentation of the information required by this Standard as a supplement to unrestated financial statements is not permitted.
Furthermore, separate presentation of the financial statements before restatement is discouraged.
The consistent application of these procedures and judgements from period to period is more important than the precise accuracy of the resulting amounts included in the restated financial statements.
Monetary items are money held and items to be received or paid in money.
These items are carried at this adjusted amount in the restated statement of financial position.
All other non-monetary assets and liabilities are restated.
The restated cost, or cost less depreciation, of each item is determined by applying to its historical cost and accumulated depreciation the change in a general price index from the date of acquisition to the end of the reporting period.
For example, property, plant and equipment, inventories of raw materials and merchandise, goodwill, patents, trademarks and similar assets are restated from the dates of their purchase.
Inventories of partly-finished and finished goods are restated from the dates on which the costs of purchase and of conversion were incurred.
In these circumstances, it may be necessary to use an estimate based, for example, on the movements in the exchange rate between the functional currency and a relatively stable foreign currency.
In these cases, the carrying amounts are restated from the date of the revaluation.
For example, restated amounts of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, patents and trademarks are reduced to recoverable amount and restated amounts of inventories are reduced to net realisable value.
The statement of financial position and statement of comprehensive income of such an investee are restated in accordance with this Standard in order to calculate the investor's share of its net assets and profit or loss.
It is not appropriate both to restate the capital expenditure financed by borrowing and to capitalise that part of the borrowing costs that compensates for the inflation during the same period.
This part of the borrowing costs is recognised as an expense in the period in which the costs are incurred.
Where it is impracticable to impute the amount of interest, such assets are restated from the payment date and not the date of purchase.
Any revaluation surplus that arose in previous periods is eliminated.
Therefore all amounts need to be restated by applying the change in the general price index from the dates when the items of income and expenses were initially recorded in the financial statements.
This gain or loss on the net monetary position may be derived as the difference resulting from the restatement of non-monetary assets, owners' equity and items in the statement of comprehensive income and the adjustment of index linked assets and liabilities.
The gain or loss may be estimated by applying the change in a general price index to the weighted average for the period of the difference between monetary assets and monetary liabilities.
Other income and expense items, such as interest income and expense, and foreign exchange differences related to invested or borrowed funds, are also associated with the net monetary position.
Although such items are separately disclosed, it may be helpful if they are presented together with the gain or loss on net monetary position in the statement of comprehensive income.
Therefore all amounts need to be restated into the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period by applying a general price index.
Information that is disclosed in respect of earlier periods is also expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period.
The financial statements of any such subsidiary need to be restated by applying a general price index of the country in whose currency it reports before they are included in the consolidated financial statements issued by its parent.
Where such a subsidiary is a foreign subsidiary, its restated financial statements are translated at closing rates.
It is preferable that all entities that report in the currency of the same economy use the same index.
the fact that the financial statements and the corresponding figures for previous periods have been restated for the changes in the general purchasing power of the functional currency and, as a result, are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period;

They are also intended to provide other information necessary to understand that basis and the resulting amounts.
provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Relationship between provisions and contingent liabilities
Probable outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
APPLICATION OF THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT RULES
The objective of this Standard is to ensure that appropriate recognition criteria and measurement bases are applied to provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets and that sufficient information is disclosed in the notes to enable users to understand their nature, timing and amount.
those covered by another Standard.
These issues are not addressed in this Standard.
Accordingly, this Standard neither prohibits nor requires capitalisation of the costs recognised when a provision is made.
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount.
A liability is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.
An obligating event is an event that creates a legal or constructive obligation that results in an entity having no realistic alternative to settling that obligation.
A legal obligation is an obligation that derives from
a contract (through its explicit or implicit terms);
A constructive obligation is an obligation that derives from an entity's actions where
as a result, the entity has created a valid expectation on the part of those other parties that it will discharge those responsibilities.
a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because
the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
A restructuring is a programme that is planned and controlled by management, and materially changes either
the manner in which that business is conducted.
Although it is sometimes necessary to estimate the amount or timing of accruals, the uncertainty is generally much less than for provisions.
Accruals are often reported as part of trade and other payables, whereas provisions are reported separately.
In addition, the term 'contingent liability' is used for liabilities that do not meet the recognition criteria.
contingent liabilities – which are not recognised as liabilities because they are either
possible obligations, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits; or
present obligations that do not meet the recognition criteria in this Standard (because either it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made).
an entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If these conditions are not met, no provision shall be recognised.
In these cases, a past event is deemed to give rise to a present obligation if, taking account of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that a present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period.
In rare cases, for example in a lawsuit, it may be disputed either whether certain events have occurred or whether those events result in a present obligation.
In such a case, an entity determines whether a present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period by taking account of all available evidence, including, for example, the opinion of experts.
The evidence considered includes any additional evidence provided by events after the reporting period.
On the basis of such evidence
where it is more likely that no present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period, the entity discloses a contingent liability, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote (see paragraph 86).
For an event to be an obligating event, it is necessary that the entity has no realistic alternative to settling the obligation created by the event.
This is the case only
in the case of a constructive obligation, where the event (which may be an action of the entity) creates valid expectations in other parties that the entity will discharge the obligation.
Therefore, no provision is recognised for costs that need to be incurred to operate in the future.
The only liabilities recognised in an entity's statement of financial position are those that exist at the end of the reporting period.
Examples of such obligations are penalties or clean-up costs for unlawful environmental damage, both of which would lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement regardless of the future actions of the entity.
Similarly, an entity recognises a provision for the decommissioning costs of an oil installation or a nuclear power station to the extent that the entity is obliged to rectify damage already caused.
Because the entity can avoid the future expenditure by its future actions, for example by changing its method of operation, it has no present obligation for that future expenditure and no provision is recognised.
It is not necessary, however, to know the identity of the party to whom the obligation is owed — indeed the obligation may be to the public at large.
Because an obligation always involves a commitment to another party, it follows that a management or board decision does not give rise to a constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period unless the decision has been communicated before the end of the reporting period to those affected by it in a sufficiently specific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will discharge its responsibilities.
For example, when environmental damage is caused there may be no obligation to remedy the consequences.
However, the causing of the damage will become an obligating event when a new law requires the existing damage to be rectified or when the entity publicly accepts responsibility for rectification in a way that creates a constructive obligation.
For the purpose of this Standard, such an obligation is treated as a legal obligation.
Differences in circumstances surrounding enactment make it impossible to specify a single event that would make the enactment of a law virtually certain.
In many cases it will be impossible to be virtually certain of the enactment of a law until it is enacted.
Where it is not probable that a present obligation exists, an entity discloses a contingent liability, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote (see paragraph 86).
If that is the case, a provision is recognised (if the other recognition criteria are met).
This is especially true in the case of provisions, which by their nature are more uncertain than most other items in the statement of financial position.
Except in extremely rare cases, an entity will be able to determine a range of possible outcomes and can therefore make an estimate of the obligation that is sufficiently reliable to use in recognising a provision.
That liability is disclosed as a contingent liability (see paragraph 86).
The entity recognises a provision for the part of the obligation for which an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is probable, except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made.
Therefore, they are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits has become probable.
If it becomes probable that an outflow of future economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change in probability occurs (except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made).
An example is a claim that an entity is pursuing through legal processes, where the outcome is uncertain.
If it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change occurs.
If an inflow of economic benefits has become probable, an entity discloses the contingent asset (see paragraph 89).
It will often be impossible or prohibitively expensive to settle or transfer an obligation at the end of the reporting period.
However, the estimate of the amount that an entity would rationally pay to settle or transfer the obligation gives the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.
Where the provision being measured involves a large population of items, the obligation is estimated by weighting all possible outcomes by their associated probabilities.
The name for this statistical method of estimation is 'expected value'.
Where there is a continuous range of possible outcomes, and each point in that range is as likely as any other, the mid-point of the range is used.
The expected value of the cost of repairs is
However, even in such a case, the entity considers other possible outcomes.
Where other possible outcomes are either mostly higher or mostly lower than the most likely outcome, the best estimate will be a higher or lower amount.
A risk adjustment may increase the amount at which a liability is measured.
Caution is needed in making judgements under conditions of uncertainty, so that income or assets are not overstated and expenses or liabilities are not understated.
However, uncertainty does not justify the creation of excessive provisions or a deliberate overstatement of liabilities.
For example, if the projected costs of a particularly adverse outcome are estimated on a prudent basis, that outcome is not then deliberately treated as more probable than is realistically the case.
Care is needed to avoid duplicating adjustments for risk and uncertainty with consequent overstatement of a provision.
Provisions are therefore discounted, where the effect is material.
For example, an entity may believe that the cost of cleaning up a site at the end of its life will be reduced by future changes in technology.
The amount recognised reflects a reasonable expectation of technically qualified, objective observers, taking account of all available evidence as to the technology that will be available at the time of the clean-up.
Thus it is appropriate to include, for example, expected cost reductions associated with increased experience in applying existing technology or the expected cost of applying existing technology to a larger or more complex clean-up operation than has previously been carried out.
However, an entity does not anticipate the development of a completely new technology for cleaning up unless it is supported by sufficient objective evidence.
The variety of circumstances that arise in practice makes it impossible to specify a single event that will provide sufficient, objective evidence in every case.
In many cases sufficient objective evidence will not exist until the new legislation is enacted.
Instead, an entity recognises gains on expected disposals of assets at the time specified by the Standard dealing with the assets concerned.
The reimbursement shall be treated as a separate asset.
The amount recognised for the reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of the provision.
The other party may either reimburse amounts paid by the entity or pay the amounts directly.
In this situation, a provision is recognised for the full amount of the liability, and a separate asset for the expected reimbursement is recognised when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the liability.
In such a case the entity has no liability for those costs and they are not included in the provision.
If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision shall be reversed.
This increase is recognised as borrowing cost.
Application of the recognition and measurement rules
Other contracts establish both rights and obligations for each of the contracting parties.
Where events make such a contract onerous, the contract falls within the scope of this Standard and a liability exists which is recognised.
The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it.

fundamental reorganisations that have a material effect on the nature and focus of the entity's operations.

(iv) the expenditures that will be undertaken; and
has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
A public announcement of a detailed plan to restructure constitutes a constructive obligation to restructure only if it is made in such a way and in sufficient detail (ie setting out the main features of the plan) that it gives rise to valid expectations in other parties such as customers, suppliers and employees (or their representatives) that the entity will carry out the restructuring.
If it is expected that there will be a long delay before the restructuring begins or that the restructuring will take an unreasonably long time, it is unlikely that the plan will raise a valid expectation on the part of others that the entity is at present committed to restructuring, because the timeframe allows opportunities for the entity to change its plans.
announced the main features of the restructuring plan to those affected by it in a sufficiently specific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will carry out the restructuring.
For example, negotiations with employee representatives for termination payments, or with purchasers for the sale of an operation, may have been concluded subject only to board approval.
Because a decision by such a board involves communication to these representatives, it may result in a constructive obligation to restructure.
Until there is a binding sale agreement, the entity will be able to change its mind and indeed will have to take another course of action if a purchaser cannot be found on acceptable terms.

These expenditures relate to the future conduct of the business and are not liabilities for restructuring at the end of the reporting period.
Such expenditures are recognised on the same basis as if they arose independently of a restructuring.

In such cases, an entity need not disclose the information, but shall disclose the general nature of the dispute, together with the fact that, and reason why, the information has not been disclosed.
Entities are encouraged, but not required, to adjust the opening balance of retained earnings for the earliest period presented and to restate comparative information.
If comparative information is not restated, this fact shall be disclosed.
The interpretation of 'probable' in this Standard as 'more likely than not' does not necessarily apply in other Standards.
changes in existing decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities
In this Interpretation such obligations are referred to as 'decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities'.
Under IAS 16, the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.
This Interpretation provides guidance on how to account for the effect of changes in the measurement of existing decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities.
For example, a decommissioning, restoration or similar liability may exist for decommissioning a plant, rehabilitating environmental damage in extractive industries, or removing equipment.
an increase that reflects the passage of time (also referred to as the unwinding of the discount).
subject to (b), changes in the liability shall be added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the current period.
the amount deducted from the cost of the asset shall not exceed its carrying amount.
If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss.
if the adjustment results in an addition to the cost of an asset, the entity shall consider whether this is an indication that the new carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
changes in the liability alter the revaluation surplus or deficit previously recognised on that asset, so that
a decrease in the liability shall (subject to (b)) be recognised in other comprehensive income and increase the revaluation surplus within equity, except that it shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation deficit on the asset that was previously recognised in profit or loss;
an increase in the liability shall be recognised in profit or loss, except that it shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and reduce the revaluation surplus within equity to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset.
in the event that a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount that would have been recognised had the asset been carried under the cost model, the excess shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss.
a change in the liability is an indication that the asset may have to be revalued in order to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period.
Any such revaluation shall be taken into account in determining the amounts to be recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income under (a).
If a revaluation is necessary, all assets of that class shall be revalued.
In complying with this requirement, the change in the revaluation surplus arising from a change in the liability shall be separately identified and disclosed as such.
Therefore, once the related asset has reached the end of its useful life, all subsequent changes in the liability shall be recognised in profit or loss as they occur.
This applies under both the cost model and the revaluation model.
The grantor may be a public or private sector entity, including a governmental body.
Examples of service concession arrangements involve water treatment and supply facilities, motorways, car parks, tunnels, bridges, airports and telecommunication networks.
Examples of arrangements that are not service concession arrangements include an entity outsourcing the operation of its internal services (eg employee cafeteria, building maintenance, and accounting or information technology functions).

when applicable, committing to return at the end of the concession period the rights received at the beginning of the concession period and/or acquired during the concession period.
Therefore, this Interpretation addresses additional disclosures of service concession arrangements.
An operator and a grantor shall disclose the following in each period
a description of the arrangement;
significant terms of the arrangement that may affect the amount, timing and certainty of future cash flows (eg the period of the concession, re-pricing dates and the basis upon which re-pricing or re-negotiation is determined);
rights to use specified assets;
obligations to provide or rights to expect provision of services;
(iii) obligations to acquire or build items of property, plant and equipment;
(iv) obligations to deliver or rights to receive specified assets at the end of the concession period;
renewal and termination options; and
(vi) other rights and obligations (eg major overhauls);
how the service arrangement has been classified.
An operator shall disclose the amount of revenue and profits or losses recognised in the period on exchanging construction services for a financial asset or an intangible asset.
A class is a grouping of service concession arrangements involving services of a similar nature (eg toll collections, telecommunications and water treatment services).

Definitions relating to hedge accounting
A firm commitment is a binding agreement for the exchange of a specified quantity of resources at a specified price on a specified future date or dates.
A forecast transaction is an uncommitted but anticipated future transaction.
Hedge effectiveness is the degree to which changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument (see Appendix A paragraphs AG105–AG113A).
In that case the entity must also apply the specific requirements for fair value hedge accounting for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk (see paragraphs 81A, 89A and AG114–AG132).
However, a non-derivative financial asset or non-derivative financial liability may be designated as a hedging instrument only for a hedge of a foreign currency risk.
Although individual entities within a consolidated group or divisions within an entity may enter into hedging transactions with other entities within the group or divisions within the entity, any such intragroup transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Therefore, such hedging transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting in the consolidated financial statements of the group.
However, they may qualify for hedge accounting in the individual or separate financial statements of individual entities within the group provided that they are external to the individual entity that is being reported on.
Thus, a hedging relationship is designated by an entity for a hedging instrument in its entirety.
separating the interest element and the spot price of a forward contract.
These exceptions are permitted because the intrinsic value of the option and the premium on the forward can generally be measured separately.
However, a hedging relationship may not be designated for only a portion of the time period during which a hedging instrument remains outstanding.
The hedged item can be (a) a single asset, liability, firm commitment, highly probable forecast transaction or net investment in a foreign operation, (b) a group of assets, liabilities, firm commitments, highly probable forecast transactions or net investments in foreign operations with similar risk characteristics or (c) in a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk only, a portion of the portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities that share the risk being hedged.
It follows that hedge accounting can be applied to transactions between entities in the same group only in the individual or separate financial statements of those entities and not in the consolidated financial statements of the group, except for the consolidated financial statements of an investment entity, as defined in IFRS 10, where transactions between an investment entity and its subsidiaries measured at fair value through profit or loss will not be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
In addition, the foreign currency risk of a highly probable forecast intragroup transaction may qualify as a hedged item in consolidated financial statements provided that the transaction is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity entering into that transaction and the foreign currency risk will affect consolidated profit or loss.
For example, an identifiable and separately measurable portion of the interest rate exposure of an interest-bearing asset or interest-bearing liability may be designated as the hedged risk (such as a risk-free interest rate or benchmark interest rate component of the total interest rate exposure of a hedged financial instrument).
In a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities (and only in such a hedge), the portion hedged may be designated in terms of an amount of a currency (eg an amount of dollars, euro, pounds or rand) rather than as individual assets (or liabilities).
Although the portfolio may, for risk management purposes, include assets and liabilities, the amount designated is an amount of assets or an amount of liabilities.
Designation of a net amount including assets and liabilities is not permitted.
The entity may hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with this designated amount.
For example, in the case of a hedge of a portfolio containing prepayable assets, the entity may hedge the change in fair value that is attributable to a change in the hedged interest rate on the basis of expected, rather than contractual, repricing dates.
When the portion hedged is based on expected repricing dates, the effect that changes in the hedged interest rate have on those expected repricing dates shall be included when determining the change in the fair value of the hedged item.
Consequently, if a portfolio that contains prepayable items is hedged with a non-prepayable derivative, ineffectiveness arises if the dates on which items in the hedged portfolio are expected to prepay are revised, or actual prepayment dates differ from those expected.
Furthermore, the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk for each individual item in the group shall be expected to be approximately proportional to the overall change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk of the group of items.
fair value hedge: a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss.
cash flow hedge: a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction and (ii) could affect profit or loss.
That documentation shall include identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk shall adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and be recognised in profit or loss.
This applies if the hedged item is otherwise measured at cost.
For a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portion of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities (and only in such a hedge), the requirement in paragraph 89(b) may be met by presenting the gain or loss attributable to the hedged item either
in a single separate line item within liabilities, for those repricing time periods for which the hedged item is a liability.
The separate line items referred to in (a) and (b) above shall be presented next to financial assets or financial liabilities.
Amounts included in these line items shall be removed from the statement of financial position when the assets or liabilities to which they relate are derecognised.
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
For this purpose, the replacement or rollover of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an expiration or termination if such replacement or rollover is part of the entity's documented hedging strategy.
Additionally, for this purpose there is not an expiration or termination of the hedging instrument if
For this purpose, a clearing counterparty is a central counterparty (sometimes called a 'clearing organisation' or 'clearing agency') or an entity or entities, for example, a clearing member of a clearing organisation or a client of a clearing member of a clearing organisation, that are acting as counterparty in order to effect clearing by a central counterparty.
other changes, if any, to the hedging instrument are limited to those that are necessary to effect such a replacement of the counterparty.
Such changes are limited to those that are consistent with the terms that would be expected if the hedging instrument were originally cleared with the clearing counterparty.
Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
The adjustment is based on a recalculated effective interest rate at the date amortisation begins.
However, if, in the case of a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities (and only in such a hedge), amortising using a recalculated effective interest rate is not practicable, the adjustment shall be amortised using a straight-line method.
The adjustment shall be amortised fully by maturity of the financial instrument or, in the case of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, by expiry of the relevant repricing time period.
The changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are also recognised in profit or loss.
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument shall be recognised in profit or loss.
the separate component of equity associated with the hedged item is adjusted to the lesser of the following (in absolute amounts)
the cumulative change in fair value (present value) of the expected future cash flows on the hedged item from inception of the hedge;
For the purpose of this subparagraph, the replacement or rollover of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an expiration or termination if such replacement or rollover is part of the entity's documented hedging strategy.
Additionally, for the purpose of this subparagraph there is not an expiration or termination of the hedging instrument if
A forecast transaction that is no longer highly probable (see paragraph 88(c)) may still be expected to occur.
For hedges of a forecast transaction, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was effective (see paragraph 95(a)) shall remain separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur.
If the transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.
the ineffective portion shall be recognised in profit or loss.
These paragraphs apply only to such hedging relationships.
A hedging relationship is directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform only if the reform gives rise to uncertainties about
the interest rate benchmark (contractually or non-contractually specified) designated as a hedged risk; and/or
the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or of the hedging instrument.
An entity shall continue to apply all other hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform.
For the purpose of applying the requirement in paragraph 88(c) that a forecast transaction must be highly probable, an entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.
For the purpose of applying the requirements in paragraphs 88(b) and AG105(a), an entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.
A hedged item that has been assessed at the time of its initial designation in the hedging relationship, whether it was at the time of the hedge inception or subsequently, is not reassessed at any subsequent redesignation in the same hedging relationship.
An entity shall prospectively cease applying paragraph 102D to a hedged item at the earlier of
when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item; and
when the hedging relationship that the hedged item is part of is discontinued.
An entity shall prospectively cease applying paragraph 102E at the earlier of
when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based future cash flows of the hedged item; and
when the entire cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income with respect to that discontinued hedging relationship has been reclassified to profit or loss.
An entity shall prospectively cease applying paragraph 102F
when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the hedged risk and the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or of the hedging instrument; and
The opening balance of retained earnings for the earliest prior period presented and all other comparative amounts shall be adjusted as if this Standard had always been in use unless restating the information would be impracticable.
If restatement is impracticable, the entity shall disclose that fact and indicate the extent to which the information was restated.
If an entity has designated as the hedged item an external forecast transaction that
is denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction
would have qualified for hedge accounting had it not been denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into it
Earlier application of all the amendments is permitted.
An entity shall apply these amendments retrospectively to these hedging relationships that existed at the beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies these amendments or were designated thereafter, and to the gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income that existed at the beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies these amendments.
The potential loss on an option that an entity writes could be significantly greater than the potential gain in value of a related hedged item.
In other words, a written option is not effective in reducing the profit or loss exposure of a hedged item.
Therefore, a written option does not qualify as a hedging instrument unless it is designated as an offset to a purchased option, including one that is embedded in another financial instrument (for example, a written call option used to hedge a callable liability).
In contrast, a purchased option has potential gains equal to or greater than losses and therefore has the potential to reduce profit or loss exposure from changes in fair values or cash flows.
Accordingly, it can qualify as a hedging instrument.
A financial asset measured at amortised cost may be designated as a hedging instrument in a hedge of foreign currency risk.
A firm commitment to acquire a business in a business combination cannot be a hedged item, except for foreign exchange risk, because the other risks being hedged cannot be specifically identified and measured.
These other risks are general business risks.
An equity method investment cannot be a hedged item in a fair value hedge because the equity method recognises in profit or loss the investor's share of the associate's profit or loss, rather than changes in the investment's fair value.
For a similar reason, an investment in a consolidated subsidiary cannot be a hedged item in a fair value hedge because consolidation recognises in profit or loss the subsidiary's profit or loss, rather than changes in the investment's fair value.
For this purpose an entity can be a parent, subsidiary, associate, joint venture or branch.
This is usually the case for royalty payments, interest payments or management charges between members of the same group unless there is a related external transaction.
AG99BA An entity can designate all changes in the cash flows or fair value of a hedged item in a hedging relationship.
In such a situation, only cash flow losses that result from an increase in the price above the specified level are designated.
The hedged risk does not include the time value of a purchased option because the time value is not a component of the forecast transaction that affects profit or loss (paragraph 86(b)).
AG99D In addition, if a fixed rate financial instrument is hedged some time after its origination and interest rates have changed in the meantime, the entity can designate a portion equal to a benchmark rate that is higher than the contractual rate paid on the item.
AG99F To be eligible for hedge accounting, the designated risks and portions must be separately identifiable components of the financial instrument, and changes in the cash flows or fair value of the entire financial instrument arising from changes in the designated risks and portions must be reliably measurable.
for a fixed rate financial instrument hedged for changes in fair value attributable to changes in a risk-free or benchmark interest rate, the risk-free or benchmark rate is normally regarded as both a separately identifiable component of the financial instrument and reliably measurable.
a contractually specified inflation portion of the cash flows of a recognised inflation-linked bond (assuming there is no requirement to account for an embedded derivative separately) is separately identifiable and reliably measurable as long as other cash flows of the instrument are not affected by the inflation portion.
Thus, a non-financial asset or non-financial liability is a hedged item only in its entirety or for foreign exchange risk.
For this purpose, the amount of the hedging instrument may be greater or less than that of the hedged item if this improves the effectiveness of the hedging relationship.
For example, a regression analysis could be performed to establish a statistical relationship between the hedged item (eg a transaction in Brazilian coffee) and the hedging instrument (eg a transaction in Colombian coffee).
However, the hedging relationship may result in ineffectiveness that is recognised in profit or loss during the term of the hedging relationship.
AG101 A hedge of an overall net position (eg the net of all fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities with similar maturities), rather than of a specific hedged item, does not qualify for hedge accounting.
However, almost the same effect on profit or loss of hedge accounting for this type of hedging relationship can be achieved by designating as the hedged item part of the underlying items.
This designation can be used if such assets and liabilities are fixed rate instruments, in which case it is a fair value hedge, or if they are variable rate instruments, in which case it is a cash flow hedge.
AG103 An example of a cash flow hedge is the use of a swap to change floating rate debt to fixed rate debt (ie a hedge of a future transaction where the future cash flows being hedged are the future interest payments).
AG104 A hedge of a firm commitment (eg a hedge of the change in fuel price relating to an unrecognised contractual commitment by an electric utility to purchase fuel at a fixed price) is a hedge of an exposure to a change in fair value.
Accordingly, such a hedge is a fair value hedge.
Such an expectation can be demonstrated in various ways, including a comparison of past changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk with past changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument, or by demonstrating a high statistical correlation between the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and those of the hedging instrument.
In this example, assuming the hedge meets the condition in (a), the entity would conclude that the hedge has been highly effective.
AG107 This Standard does not specify a single method for assessing hedge effectiveness.
The method an entity adopts for assessing hedge effectiveness depends on its risk management strategy.
For example, if the entity's risk management strategy is to adjust the amount of the hedging instrument periodically to reflect changes in the hedged position, the entity needs to demonstrate that the hedge is expected to be highly effective only for the period until the amount of the hedging instrument is next adjusted.
In some cases, an entity adopts different methods for different types of hedges.
An entity's documentation of its hedging strategy includes its procedures for assessing effectiveness.
Those procedures state whether the assessment includes all of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument or whether the instrument's time value is excluded.
For example, an interest rate swap is likely to be an effective hedge if the notional and principal amounts, term, repricing dates, dates of interest and principal receipts and payments, and basis for measuring interest rates are the same for the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
the forward contract is for the purchase of the same quantity of the same commodity at the same time and location as the hedged forecast purchase;
AG109 Sometimes the hedging instrument offsets only part of the hedged risk.
For example, a hedge would not be fully effective if the hedging instrument and hedged item are denominated in different currencies that do not move in tandem.
Also, a hedge of interest rate risk using a derivative would not be fully effective if part of the change in the fair value of the derivative is attributable to the counterparty's credit risk.
AG110A Paragraph 74(a) permits an entity to separate the intrinsic value and time value of an option contract and designate as the hedging instrument only the change in the intrinsic value of the option contract.
Therefore, in this situation, there will be no offset between the cash flows relating to the time value of the option premium paid and the designated hedged risk.
AG111 In the case of interest rate risk, hedge effectiveness may be assessed by preparing a maturity schedule for financial assets and financial liabilities that shows the net interest rate exposure for each time period, provided that the net exposure is associated with a specific asset or liability (or a specific group of assets or liabilities or a specific portion of them) giving rise to the net exposure, and hedge effectiveness is assessed against that asset or liability.
The fixed interest rate on a hedged item need not exactly match the fixed interest rate on a swap designated as a fair value hedge.
Nor does the variable interest rate on an interest-bearing asset or liability need to be the same as the variable interest rate on a swap designated as a cash flow hedge.
A swap's fair value derives from its net settlements.
The fixed and variable rates on a swap can be changed without affecting the net settlement if both are changed by the same amount.
AG113 If an entity does not meet hedge effectiveness criteria, the entity discontinues hedge accounting from the last date on which compliance with hedge effectiveness was demonstrated.
However, if the entity identifies the event or change in circumstances that caused the hedging relationship to fail the effectiveness criteria, and demonstrates that the hedge was effective before the event or change in circumstances occurred, the entity discontinues hedge accounting from the date of the event or change in circumstances.
The portfolio may comprise only assets, only liabilities or both assets and liabilities.
The analysis into repricing time periods may be performed in various ways including scheduling cash flows into the periods in which they are expected to occur, or scheduling notional principal amounts into all periods until repricing is expected to occur.
The entity designates as the hedged item an amount of assets or liabilities (but not a net amount) from the identified portfolio equal to the amount it wishes to designate as being hedged.
This amount also determines the percentage measure that is used for testing effectiveness in accordance with paragraph AG126(b).
This risk could be a portion of the interest rate risk in each of the items in the hedged position, such as a benchmark interest rate (eg LIBOR).
The change in fair value need not be allocated to individual assets or liabilities.
The approach shall be applied only to a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk associated with a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities.
Alternatively, it could be a portfolio containing only assets, or only liabilities.
The portfolio is used to determine the amount of the assets or liabilities the entity wishes to hedge.
However, the portfolio is not itself designated as the hedged item.
The expected repricing dates are estimated at the inception of the hedge and throughout the term of the hedge, based on historical experience and other available information, including information and expectations regarding prepayment rates, interest rates and the interaction between them.
Entities that have no entity-specific experience or insufficient experience use peer group experience for comparable financial instruments.
These estimates are reviewed periodically and updated in the light of experience.
For a group of similar items, the analysis into time periods based on expected repricing dates may take the form of allocating a percentage of the group, rather than individual items, to each time period.
An entity may apply other methodologies for such allocation purposes.
For example, it may use a prepayment rate multiplier for allocating amortising loans to time periods based on expected repricing dates.
However, the methodology for such an allocation shall be in accordance with the entity's risk management procedures and objectives.
items that could have qualified for fair value hedge accounting if they had been designated as hedged individually.
In the above example, the hedged position is an amount of assets.
Hence, such liabilities are not a part of the designated hedged item, but are used by the entity to determine the amount of the asset that is designated as being hedged.
If the position the entity wished to hedge was an amount of liabilities, the amount representing the designated hedged item must be drawn from fixed rate liabilities other than liabilities that the entity can be required to repay in an earlier time period, and the percentage measure used for assessing hedge effectiveness in accordance with paragraph AG126(b) would be calculated as a percentage of these other liabilities.
For a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, this designation and documentation specifies the entity's policy for all of the variables that are used to identify the amount that is hedged and how effectiveness is measured, including the following
which assets and liabilities are to be included in the portfolio hedge and the basis to be used for removing them from the portfolio.
how the entity estimates repricing dates, including what interest rate assumptions underlie estimates of prepayment rates and the basis for changing those estimates.
The same method is used for both the initial estimates made at the time an asset or liability is included in the hedged portfolio and for any later revisions to those estimates.
the number and duration of repricing time periods.
the methodology used by the entity to determine the amount of assets or liabilities that are designated as the hedged item and, accordingly, the percentage measure used when the entity tests effectiveness using the method described in paragraph AG126(b).
The policies specified in designating and documenting the hedging relationship shall be in accordance with the entity's risk management procedures and objectives.
Changes in policies shall not be made arbitrarily.
They shall be justified on the basis of changes in market conditions and other factors and be founded on and consistent with the entity's risk management procedures and objectives.
AG120 The hedging instrument referred to in paragraph AG114(e) may be a single derivative or a portfolio of derivatives all of which contain exposure to the hedged interest rate risk designated in paragraph AG114(d) (eg a portfolio of interest rate swaps all of which contain exposure to LIBOR).
Such a portfolio of derivatives may contain offsetting risk positions.
For prepayable items, paragraph 81A permits this to be achieved by designating the hedged item in terms of the change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in the designated interest rate on the basis of expected, rather than contractual, repricing dates.
However, the effect that changes in the hedged interest rate have on those expected repricing dates shall be included when determining the change in the fair value of the hedged item.
Consequently, if the expected repricing dates are revised (eg to reflect a change in expected prepayments), or if actual repricing dates differ from those expected, ineffectiveness will arise as described in paragraph AG126.
If there is uncertainty about the factor that gave rise to the change in expected repricing dates or the entity is not able to separate reliably the changes that arise from the hedged interest rate from those that arise from other factors, the change is assumed to arise from changes in the hedged interest rate.
If statistical or other estimation techniques are used for such measurement, management must expect the result to approximate closely that which would have been obtained from measurement of all the individual assets or liabilities that constitute the hedged item.
It is not appropriate to assume that changes in the fair value of the hedged item equal changes in the value of the hedging instrument.
Conversely, if the hedged item for a particular repricing time period is a liability, the change in its value is presented in a separate line item within liabilities.
These are the separate line items referred to in paragraph AG114(g).
Specific allocation to individual assets (or liabilities) is not required.
Such a difference may arise for a number of reasons, including
actual repricing dates being different from those expected, or expected repricing dates being revised;
items in the hedged portfolio becoming impaired or being derecognised;
other causes (eg when a few of the hedged items bear interest at a rate below the benchmark rate for which they are designated as being hedged, and the resulting ineffectiveness is not so great that the portfolio as a whole fails to qualify for hedge accounting).
AG125 Generally, the effectiveness of the hedge will be improved
if the entity schedules items with different prepayment characteristics in a way that takes account of the differences in prepayment behaviour.
when the number of items in the portfolio is larger.
Conversely, when the portfolio contains many items, the prepayment behaviour can be predicted more accurately.
Narrower repricing time periods reduce the effect of any mismatch between the repricing and payment dates (within the repricing time period) of the hedged item and those of the hedging instrument.
AG126 An entity tests effectiveness periodically.
If estimates of repricing dates change between one date on which an entity assesses effectiveness and the next, it shall calculate the amount of effectiveness either
as the difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument (see paragraph AG114(h)) and the change in the value of the entire hedged item that is attributable to changes in the hedged interest rate (including the effect that changes in the hedged interest rate have on the fair value of any embedded prepayment option); or
calculates the percentage of the assets (or liabilities) in each repricing time period that was hedged, on the basis of the estimated repricing dates at the last date it tested effectiveness.
applies this percentage to its revised estimate of the amount in that repricing time period to calculate the amount of the hedged item based on its revised estimate.
(iii) calculates the change in the fair value of its revised estimate of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk and presents it as set out in paragraph AG114(g).
(iv) recognises ineffectiveness equal to the difference between the amount determined in (iii) and the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument (see paragraph AG114(h)).
AG127 When measuring effectiveness, the entity distinguishes revisions to the estimated repricing dates of existing assets (or liabilities) from the origination of new assets (or liabilities), with only the former giving rise to ineffectiveness.
Once ineffectiveness has been recognised as set out above, the entity establishes a new estimate of the total assets (or liabilities) in each repricing time period, including new assets (or liabilities) that have been originated since it last tested effectiveness, and designates a new amount as the hedged item and a new percentage as the hedged percentage.
When this occurs, the amount of change in fair value included in the separate line item referred to in paragraph AG114(g) that relates to the derecognised item shall be removed from the statement of financial position, and included in the gain or loss that arises on derecognition of the item.
When an item is derecognised, if it can be determined in which time period it was included, it is removed from that time period.
If not, it is removed from the earliest time period if the derecognition resulted from higher than expected prepayments, or allocated to all time periods containing the derecognised item on a systematic and rational basis if the item was sold or became impaired.
These remaining periods are then adjusted, as necessary, for changes in fair value as described in paragraph AG114(g).
Such an entity would revoke the previous designation of a cash flow hedge in accordance with paragraph 101(d), and apply the requirements set out in that paragraph.
It would also redesignate the hedge as a fair value hedge and apply the approach set out in paragraphs AG114–AG131 prospectively to subsequent accounting periods.
However, in accordance with paragraph 108B, it need not apply paragraph AG99B to comparative information for earlier periods.
The same materiality considerations apply in this context as apply throughout IFRSs.

CONCEPTS OF CAPITAL MAINTENANCE AND THE DETERMINATION OF PROFIT
Status and Purpose of the Conceptual Framework
The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework) describes the objective of, and the concepts for, general purpose financial reporting.
The purpose of the Conceptual Framework is to
assist preparers to develop consistent accounting policies when no Standard applies to a particular transaction or other event, or when a Standard allows a choice of accounting policy; and
assist all parties to understand and interpret the Standards.
The Conceptual Framework is not a Standard.
Nothing in the Conceptual Framework overrides any Standard or any requirement in a Standard.
To meet the objective of general purpose financial reporting, the Board may sometimes specify requirements that depart from aspects of the Conceptual Framework.
If the Board does so, it will explain the departure in the Basis for Conclusions on that Standard.
The Conceptual Framework may be revised from time to time on the basis of the Board's experience of working with it.
Revisions of the Conceptual Framework will not automatically lead to changes to the Standards.
Any decision to amend a Standard would require the Board to go through its due process for adding a project to its agenda and developing an amendment to that Standard.
The Conceptual Framework contributes to the stated mission of the IFRS Foundation and of the Board, which is part of the IFRS Foundation.
That mission is to develop Standards that bring transparency, accountability and efficiency to financial markets around the world.
The Board's work serves the public interest by fostering trust, growth and long-term financial stability in the global economy.
The Conceptual Framework provides the foundation for Standards that
contribute to transparency by enhancing the international comparability and quality of financial information, enabling investors and other market participants to make informed economic decisions.
strengthen accountability by reducing the information gap between the providers of capital and the people to whom they have entrusted their money.
Standards based on the Conceptual Framework provide information needed to hold management to account.
contribute to economic efficiency by helping investors to identify opportunities and risks across the world, thus improving capital allocation.
For businesses, the use of a single, trusted accounting language derived from Standards based on the Conceptual Framework lowers the cost of capital and reduces international reporting costs.
Other aspects of the Conceptual Framework — the qualitative characteristics of, and the cost constraint on, useful financial information, a reporting entity concept, elements of financial statements, recognition and derecognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure — flow logically from the objective.
Objective, usefulness and limitations of general purpose financial reporting
providing or settling loans and other forms of credit; or
exercising rights to vote on, or otherwise influence, management's actions that affect the use of the entity's economic resources.
Investors', lenders' and other creditors' expectations about returns depend on their assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of (the prospects for) future net cash inflows to the entity and on their assessment of management's stewardship of the entity's economic resources.
Existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors need information to help them make those assessments.
Those users need to consider pertinent information from other sources, for example, general economic conditions and expectations, political events and political climate, and industry and company outlooks.
The Board, in developing Standards, will seek to provide the information set that will meet the needs of the maximum number of primary users.
However, focusing on common information needs does not prevent the reporting entity from including additional information that is most useful to a particular subset of primary users.
However, management need not rely on general purpose financial reports because it is able to obtain the financial information it needs internally.
However, those reports are not primarily directed to these other groups.
The Conceptual Framework establishes the concepts that underlie those estimates, judgements and models.
The concepts are the goal towards which the Board and preparers of financial reports strive.
As with most goals, the Conceptual Framework's vision of ideal financial reporting is unlikely to be achieved in full, at least not in the short term, because it takes time to understand, accept and implement new ways of analysing transactions and other events.
Nevertheless, establishing a goal towards which to strive is essential if financial reporting is to evolve so as to improve its usefulness.
Information about a reporting entity's economic resources, claims against the entity and changes in resources and claims
Financial reports also provide information about the effects of transactions and other events that change a reporting entity's economic resources and claims.
Both types of information provide useful input for decisions relating to providing resources to an entity.
Information about priorities and payment requirements of existing claims helps users to predict how future cash flows will be distributed among those with a claim against the reporting entity.
Some future cash flows result directly from existing economic resources, such as accounts receivable.
Other cash flows result from using several resources in combination to produce and market goods or services to customers.
Although those cash flows cannot be identified with individual economic resources (or claims), users of financial reports need to know the nature and amount of the resources available for use in a reporting entity's operations.
Information about the return the entity has produced can help users to assess management's stewardship of the entity's economic resources.
Information about the variability and components of that return is also important, especially in assessing the uncertainty of future cash flows.
Information about a reporting entity's past financial performance and how its management discharged its stewardship responsibilities is usually helpful in predicting the entity's future returns on its economic resources.
That information indicates the extent to which the reporting entity has increased its available economic resources, and thus its capacity for generating net cash inflows through its operations rather than by obtaining additional resources directly from investors and creditors.
Information about a reporting entity's financial performance during a period can also help users to assess management's stewardship of the entity's economic resources.
That information indicates how the reporting entity obtains and spends cash, including information about its borrowing and repayment of debt, cash dividends or other cash distributions to investors, and other factors that may affect the entity's liquidity or solvency.
Information about cash flows helps users understand a reporting entity's operations, evaluate its financing and investing activities, assess its liquidity or solvency and interpret other information about financial performance.
Information about this type of change is necessary to give users a complete understanding of why the reporting entity's economic resources and claims changed and the implications of those changes for its future financial performance.
Information about use of the entity's economic resources
Such information is also useful for predicting how efficiently and effectively management will use the entity's economic resources in future periods.
Hence, it can be useful for assessing the entity's prospects for future net cash inflows.
Applying the fundamental qualitative characteristics
Applying the enhancing qualitative characteristics
Cost, which is a pervasive constraint on the reporting entity's ability to provide useful financial information, applies similarly.
However, the considerations in applying the qualitative characteristics and the cost constraint may be different for different types of information.
For example, applying them to forward-looking information may be different from applying them to information about existing economic resources and claims and to changes in those resources and claims.
Qualitative characteristics of useful financial information
The usefulness of financial information is enhanced if it is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable.
Information may be capable of making a difference in a decision even if some users choose not to take advantage of it or are already aware of it from other sources.
Financial information need not be a prediction or forecast to have predictive value.
Financial information with predictive value is employed by users in making their own predictions.
Information that has predictive value often also has confirmatory value.
The results of those comparisons can help a user to correct and improve the processes that were used to make those previous predictions.
Consequently, the Board cannot specify a uniform quantitative threshold for materiality or predetermine what could be material in a particular situation.
To be useful, financial information must not only represent relevant phenomena, but it must also faithfully represent the substance of the phenomena that it purports to represent.
In many circumstances, the substance of an economic phenomenon and its legal form are the same.
It would be complete, neutral and free from error.
For example, a complete depiction of a group of assets would include, at a minimum, a description of the nature of the assets in the group, a numerical depiction of all of the assets in the group, and a description of what the numerical depiction represents (for example, historical cost or fair value).
For some items, a complete depiction may also entail explanations of significant facts about the quality and nature of the items, factors and circumstances that might affect their quality and nature, and the process used to determine the numerical depiction.
A neutral depiction is not slanted, weighted, emphasised, de-emphasised or otherwise manipulated to increase the probability that financial information will be received favourably or unfavourably by users.
Neutral information does not mean information with no purpose or no influence on behaviour.
On the contrary, relevant financial information is, by definition, capable of making a difference in users' decisions.
Such misstatements can lead to the overstatement or understatement of income or expenses in future periods.
Such asymmetry is not a qualitative characteristic of useful financial information.
Nevertheless, particular Standards may contain asymmetric requirements if this is a consequence of decisions intended to select the most relevant information that faithfully represents what it purports to represent.
Free from error means there are no errors or omissions in the description of the phenomenon, and the process used to produce the reported information has been selected and applied with no errors in the process.
In this context, free from error does not mean perfectly accurate in all respects.
For example, an estimate of an unobservable price or value cannot be determined to be accurate or inaccurate.
However, a representation of that estimate can be faithful if the amount is described clearly and accurately as being an estimate, the nature and limitations of the estimating process are explained, and no errors have been made in selecting and applying an appropriate process for developing the estimate.
The use of reasonable estimates is an essential part of the preparation of financial information and does not undermine the usefulness of the information if the estimates are clearly and accurately described and explained.
Neither a faithful representation of an irrelevant phenomenon nor an unfaithful representation of a relevant phenomenon helps users make good decisions.
If so, the process of satisfying the fundamental qualitative characteristics ends at that point.
If not, the process is repeated with the next most relevant type of information.
For example, the most relevant information about a phenomenon may be a highly uncertain estimate.
In some cases, the level of measurement uncertainty involved in making that estimate may be so high that it may be questionable whether the estimate would provide a sufficiently faithful representation of that phenomenon.
In some such cases, the most useful information may be the highly uncertain estimate, accompanied by a description of the estimate and an explanation of the uncertainties that affect it.
In other such cases, if that information would not provide a sufficiently faithful representation of that phenomenon, the most useful information may include an estimate of another type that is slightly less relevant but is subject to lower measurement uncertainty.
In limited circumstances, there may be no estimate that provides useful information.
In those limited circumstances, it may be necessary to provide information that does not rely on an estimate.
Consequently, information about a reporting entity is more useful if it can be compared with similar information about other entities and with similar information about the same entity for another period or another date.
Unlike the other qualitative characteristics, comparability does not relate to a single item.
Consistency refers to the use of the same methods for the same items, either from period to period within a reporting entity or in a single period across entities.
For information to be comparable, like things must look alike and different things must look different.
Comparability of financial information is not enhanced by making unlike things look alike any more than it is enhanced by making like things look different.
A faithful representation of a relevant economic phenomenon should naturally possess some degree of comparability with a faithful representation of a similar relevant economic phenomenon by another reporting entity.
Verifiability means that different knowledgeable and independent observers could reach consensus, although not necessarily complete agreement, that a particular depiction is a faithful representation.
Quantified information need not be a single point estimate to be verifiable.
A range of possible amounts and the related probabilities can also be verified.
Direct verification means verifying an amount or other representation through direct observation, for example, by counting cash.
Indirect verification means checking the inputs to a model, formula or other technique and recalculating the outputs using the same methodology.
To help users decide whether they want to use that information, it would normally be necessary to disclose the underlying assumptions, the methods of compiling the information and other factors and circumstances that support the information.
Generally, the older the information is the less useful it is.
However, some information may continue to be timely long after the end of a reporting period because, for example, some users may need to identify and assess trends.
At times, even well-informed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand information about complex economic phenomena.
For example, a temporary reduction in comparability as a result of prospectively applying a new Standard may be worthwhile to improve relevance or faithful representation in the longer term.
Appropriate disclosures may partially compensate for non-comparability.
The cost constraint on useful financial reporting
Reporting financial information imposes costs, and it is important that those costs are justified by the benefits of reporting that information.
There are several types of costs and benefits to consider.
Users of financial information also incur costs of analysing and interpreting the information provided.
If needed information is not provided, users incur additional costs to obtain that information elsewhere or to estimate it.
An individual investor, lender or other creditor also receives benefits by making more informed decisions.
However, it is not possible for general purpose financial reports to provide all the information that every user finds relevant.
When applying the cost constraint in developing a proposed Standard, the Board seeks information from providers of financial information, users, auditors, academics and others about the expected nature and quantity of the benefits and costs of that Standard.
In most situations, assessments are based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative information.
Therefore, the Board seeks to consider costs and benefits in relation to financial reporting generally, and not just in relation to individual reporting entities.
That does not mean that assessments of costs and benefits always justify the same reporting requirements for all entities.
Differences may be appropriate because of different sizes of entities, different ways of raising capital (publicly or privately), different users' needs or other factors.
in the statement of financial position, by recognising assets, liabilities and equity;
contributions from holders of equity claims and distributions to them; and
the methods, assumptions and judgements used in estimating the amounts presented or disclosed, and changes in those methods, assumptions and judgements.
income and expenses for the reporting period.
is useful to users of financial statements.
For example, if an asset or liability is measured by estimating future cash flows, information about those estimated future cash flows may help users of financial statements to understand the reported measures.
Financial statements do not typically provide other types of forward-looking information, for example, explanatory material about management's expectations and strategies for the reporting entity.
Hence, it is assumed that the entity has neither the intention nor the need to enter liquidation or to cease trading.
A reporting entity is an entity that is required, or chooses, to prepare financial statements.
A reporting entity is not necessarily a legal entity.
is not a legal entity; and
does not comprise only legal entities linked by a parent-subsidiary relationship.
Those users need relevant information that faithfully represents what it purports to represent.
the boundary of the reporting entity does not contain an arbitrary or incomplete set of economic activities;
including that set of economic activities within the boundary of the reporting entity results in neutral information; and
a description is provided of how the boundary of the reporting entity was determined and of what constitutes the reporting entity.
That information is useful for existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors of the parent in their assessment of the prospects for future net cash inflows to the parent.
This is because net cash inflows to the parent include distributions to the parent from its subsidiaries, and those distributions depend on net cash inflows to the subsidiaries.
A subsidiary's own financial statements are designed to provide that information.
That information can be useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors of the parent because
a claim against the parent typically does not give the holder of that claim a claim against subsidiaries; and
in some jurisdictions, the amounts that can be legally distributed to holders of equity claims against the parent depend on the distributable reserves of the parent.
Another way to provide information about some or all assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses of the parent alone is in consolidated financial statements, in the notes.
Accordingly, when consolidated financial statements are required, unconsolidated financial statements cannot serve as a substitute for consolidated financial statements.
assets, liabilities and equity, which relate to a reporting entity's financial position; and
income and expenses, which relate to a reporting entity's financial performance.
A present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events.
An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits.
Changes in economic resources and claims, reflecting financial performance
Increases in assets, or decreases in liabilities, that result in increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from holders of equity claims.
Other changes in economic resources and claims
Contributions from holders of equity claims, and distributions to them.
rights to receive goods or services.
Such rights include, for example, a forward contract to buy an economic resource on terms that are currently favourable or an option to buy an economic resource.
rights that do not correspond to an obligation of another party, for example
rights over physical objects, such as property, plant and equipment or inventories.
Examples of such rights are a right to use a physical object or a right to benefit from the residual value of a leased object.
rights to use intellectual property.
For example, an entity might obtain rights from owning or leasing a physical object, from owning a debt instrument or an equity instrument, or from owning a registered patent.
However, an entity might also obtain rights in other ways, for example
An entity's right to obtain the economic benefits produced by such goods or services exists momentarily until the entity consumes the goods or services.
debt instruments or equity instruments issued by the entity and repurchased and held by it — for example, treasury shares — are not economic resources of that entity; and
For example, legal ownership of a physical object may give rise to several rights, including
the right to use the object;
the right to sell rights over the object;
the right to pledge rights over the object; and
For example, an entity and another party might dispute whether the entity has a right to receive an economic resource from that other party.
For that potential to exist, it does not need to be certain, or even likely, that the right will produce economic benefits.
receive contractual cash flows or another economic resource;
exchange economic resources with another party on favourable terms;
produce cash inflows or avoid cash outflows by, for example
using the economic resource either individually or in combination with other economic resources to produce goods or provide services;
using the economic resource to enhance the value of other economic resources; or
(iii) leasing the economic resource to another party;
receive cash or other economic resources by selling the economic resource; or
extinguish liabilities by transferring the economic resource.
For example, a purchased option derives its value from its potential to produce economic benefits through exercise of the option at a future date.
Hence, when an entity incurs expenditure, this may provide evidence that the entity has sought future economic benefits, but does not provide conclusive proof that the entity has obtained an asset.
Similarly, the absence of related expenditure does not preclude an item from meeting the definition of an asset.
Assets can include, for example, rights that a government has granted to the entity free of charge or that another party has donated to the entity.
Assessing whether control exists helps to identify the economic resource for which the entity accounts.
For example, an entity may control a proportionate share in a property without controlling the rights arising from ownership of the entire property.
In such cases, the entity's asset is the share in the property, which it controls, not the rights arising from ownership of the entire property, which it does not control.
Control includes the present ability to prevent other parties from directing the use of the economic resource and from obtaining the economic benefits that may flow from it.
However, control can also arise if an entity has other means of ensuring that it, and no other party, has the present ability to direct the use of the economic resource and obtain the benefits that may flow from it.
For example, an entity could control a right to use know-how that is not in the public domain if the entity has access to the know-how and the present ability to keep the know-how secret, even if that know-how is not protected by a registered patent.
For example, a principal may engage an agent to arrange sales of goods controlled by the principal.
If an agent has custody of an economic resource controlled by the principal, that economic resource is not an asset of the agent.
Obligations can also arise, however, from an entity's customary practices, published policies or specific statements if the entity has no practical ability to act in a manner inconsistent with those practices, policies or statements.
The obligation that arises in such situations is sometimes referred to as a 'constructive obligation'.
Such actions could include operating a particular business or operating in a particular market on a specified future date, or exercising particular options within a contract.
For example, in some cases, an entity may have no practical ability to avoid a transfer if any action that it could take to avoid the transfer would have economic consequences significantly more adverse than the transfer itself.
However, neither an intention to make a transfer, nor a high likelihood of a transfer, is sufficient reason for concluding that the entity has no practical ability to avoid a transfer.
For example, if another party is seeking compensation for an entity's alleged act of wrongdoing, it might be uncertain whether the act occurred, whether the entity committed it or how the law applies.
For that potential to exist, it does not need to be certain, or even likely, that the entity will be required to transfer an economic resource — the transfer may, for example, be required only if a specified uncertain future event occurs.
obligations to deliver goods or provide services.
obligations to exchange economic resources with another party on unfavourable terms.
Such obligations include, for example, a forward contract to sell an economic resource on terms that are currently unfavourable or an option that entitles another party to buy an economic resource from the entity.
obligations to transfer an economic resource if a specified uncertain future event occurs.
obligations to issue a financial instrument if that financial instrument will oblige the entity to transfer an economic resource.
settle the obligation by negotiating a release from the obligation;
replace that obligation to transfer an economic resource with another obligation by entering into a new transaction.
the entity has already obtained economic benefits or taken an action; and
as a consequence, the entity will or may have to transfer an economic resource that it would not otherwise have had to transfer.
The action taken could include, for example, operating a particular business or operating in a particular market.
If economic benefits are obtained, or an action is taken, over time, the resulting present obligation may accumulate over that time.
The enactment of legislation is not in itself sufficient to give an entity a present obligation.
For example, a contractual liability to pay cash may exist now even if the contract does not require a payment until a future date.
Similarly, a contractual obligation for an entity to perform work at a future date may exist now even if the counterparty cannot require the entity to perform the work until that future date.
For example, if an entity has entered into a contract to pay an employee a salary in exchange for receiving the employee's services, the entity does not have a present obligation to pay the salary until it has received the employee's services.
For example, contracts may sometimes be recognised individually but measured as part of a portfolio of contracts.
For presentation and disclosure, assets, liabilities, income and expenses may need to be aggregated or separated into components.
the information provided about the asset or liability and about any related income and expenses must be relevant.
Treating a group of rights and obligations as a single unit of account may provide more relevant information than treating each right or obligation as a separate unit of account if, for example, those rights and obligations
cannot be or are unlikely to be the subject of separate transactions;
cannot or are unlikely to expire in different patterns;
(iii) have similar economic characteristics and risks and hence are likely to have similar implications for the prospects for future net cash inflows to the entity or net cash outflows from the entity; or
(iv) are used together in the business activities conducted by an entity to produce cash flows and are measured by reference to estimates of their interdependent future cash flows.
the information provided about the asset or liability and about any related income and expenses must faithfully represent the substance of the transaction or other event from which they have arisen.
Equally, to provide a faithful representation of unrelated rights and obligations, it may be necessary to recognise and measure them separately.
Hence, in selecting a unit of account, it is important to consider whether the benefits of the information provided to users of financial statements by selecting that unit of account are likely to justify the costs of providing and using that information.
In general, the costs associated with recognising and measuring assets, liabilities, income and expenses increase as the size of the unit of account decreases.
Hence, in general, rights or obligations arising from the same source are separated only if the resulting information is more useful and the benefits outweigh the costs.
For example, some contracts establish both rights and obligations for each of the parties.
If those rights and obligations are interdependent and cannot be separated, they constitute a single inseparable asset or liability and hence form a single unit of account.
In other cases, it may be more appropriate to group separable rights and obligations in a single unit of account treating them as a single asset or a single liability.
an individual right or individual obligation;
all rights, all obligations, or all rights and all obligations, arising from a single source, for example, a contract;
a subgroup of those rights and/or obligations — for example, a subgroup of rights over an item of property, plant and equipment for which the useful life and pattern of consumption differ from those of the other rights over that item;
a group of rights and/or obligations arising from a portfolio of similar items;
a group of rights and/or obligations arising from a portfolio of dissimilar items — for example, a portfolio of assets and liabilities to be disposed of in a single transaction; and
a risk exposure within a portfolio of items — if a portfolio of items is subject to a common risk, some aspects of the accounting for that portfolio could focus on the aggregate exposure to that risk within the portfolio.
The right and obligation are interdependent and cannot be separated.
Hence, the combined right and obligation constitute a single asset or liability.
The entity has an asset if the terms of the exchange are currently favourable; it has a liability if the terms of the exchange are currently unfavourable.
Whether such an asset or liability is included in the financial statements depends on both the recognition criteria (see Chapter 5) and the measurement basis (see Chapter 6) selected for the asset or liability, including, if applicable, any test for whether the contract is onerous.
That right is an asset.
That obligation is a liability.
In some cases, the substance of the rights and obligations is clear from the legal form of the contract.
Implicit terms could include, for example, obligations imposed by statute, such as statutory warranty obligations imposed on entities that enter into contracts to sell goods to customers.
A term has no substance if it has no discernible effect on the economics of the contract.
terms that bind neither party; or
rights, including options, that the holder will not have the practical ability to exercise in any circumstances.
To report the substance of such contracts, it may be necessary to treat rights and obligations arising from that group or series of contracts as a single unit of account.
In other words, they are claims against the entity that do not meet the definition of a liability.
shares of various types, issued by the entity; and
some obligations of the entity to issue another equity claim.
dividends, if the entity decides to pay dividends to eligible holders;
the proceeds from satisfying the equity claims, either in full on liquidation, or in part at other times; or
For example, some such requirements permit an entity to make distributions to holders of equity claims only if the entity has sufficient reserves that those requirements specify as being distributable.
The legal and regulatory frameworks for such entities are often different from frameworks that apply to corporate entities.
For example, there may be few, if any, restrictions on the distribution to holders of equity claims against such entities.
Definitions of income and expenses
Users of financial statements need information about both an entity's financial position and its financial performance.
Hence, although income and expenses are defined in terms of changes in assets and liabilities, information about income and expenses is just as important as information about assets and liabilities.
Low probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits
The amount at which an asset, a liability or equity is recognised in the statement of financial position is referred to as its 'carrying amount'.
An important feature of the structures of those summaries is that the amounts recognised in a statement are included in the totals and, if applicable, subtotals that link the items recognised in the statement.
in the statement of financial position at the beginning and end of the reporting period, total assets minus total liabilities equal total equity; and
recognised changes in equity during the reporting period comprise
contributions from holders of equity claims, minus distributions to holders of equity claims.
the recognition of income occurs at the same time as
the initial recognition of an asset, or an increase in the carrying amount of an asset; or
the derecognition of a liability, or a decrease in the carrying amount of a liability.
the recognition of expenses occurs at the same time as
the initial recognition of a liability, or an increase in the carrying amount of a liability; or
the derecognition of an asset, or a decrease in the carrying amount of an asset.
The simultaneous recognition of income and related expenses is sometimes referred to as the matching of costs with income.
Application of the concepts in the Conceptual Framework leads to such matching when it arises from the recognition of changes in assets and liabilities.
However, matching of costs with income is not an objective of the Conceptual Framework.
The Conceptual Framework does not allow the recognition in the statement of financial position of items that do not meet the definition of an asset, a liability or equity.
An asset or liability is recognised only if recognition of that asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity provides users of financial statements with information that is useful, ie with
There is a cost to recognising an asset or liability.
Preparers of financial statements incur costs in obtaining a relevant measure of an asset or liability.
Users of financial statements also incur costs in analysing and interpreting the information provided.
An asset or liability is recognised if the benefits of the information provided to users of financial statements by recognition are likely to justify the costs of providing and using that information.
In some cases, the costs of recognition may outweigh its benefits.
What is useful to users depends on the item and the facts and circumstances.
Consequently, judgement is required when deciding whether to recognise an item, and thus recognition requirements may need to vary between and within Standards.
For example, if no asset is recognised when expenditure is incurred, an expense is recognised.
Over time, recognising the expense may, in some cases, provide useful information, for example, information that enables users of financial statements to identify trends.
However, recognition of a particular asset or liability and any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity may not always provide relevant information.
That may be the case if, for example
It may be a combination of factors and not any single factor that determines whether recognition provides relevant information.
In some cases, that uncertainty, possibly combined with a low probability of inflows or outflows of economic benefits and an exceptionally wide range of possible outcomes, may mean that the recognition of an asset or liability, necessarily measured at a single amount, would not provide relevant information.
Whether or not the asset or liability is recognised, explanatory information about the uncertainties associated with it may need to be provided in the financial statements.
The typical location for such information is in the notes.
Whether that is the case may depend on a variety of factors.
if an asset is acquired or a liability is incurred in an exchange transaction on market terms, its cost generally reflects the probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits.
Thus, that cost may be relevant information, and is generally readily available.
if an asset or liability arises from an event that is not an exchange transaction, recognition of the asset or liability typically results in recognition of income or expenses.
If there is only a low probability that the asset or liability will result in an inflow or outflow of economic benefits, users of financial statements might not regard the recognition of the asset and income, or the liability and expenses, as providing relevant information.
Whether a faithful representation can be provided may be affected by the level of measurement uncertainty associated with the asset or liability or by other factors.
In many cases, such measures must be estimated and are therefore subject to measurement uncertainty.
the range of possible outcomes is exceptionally wide and the probability of each outcome is exceptionally difficult to estimate.
the measure is exceptionally sensitive to small changes in estimates of the probability of different outcomes — for example, if the probability of future cash inflows or outflows occurring is exceptionally low, but the magnitude of those cash inflows or outflows will be exceptionally high if they occur.
measuring the asset or liability requires exceptionally difficult or exceptionally subjective allocations of cash flows that do not relate solely to the asset or liability being measured.
This is especially likely to be the case if that measure is the most relevant measure of the asset or liability.
In other cases, if that information would not provide a sufficiently faithful representation of the asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity, the most useful information may be a different measure (accompanied by any necessary descriptions and explanations) that is slightly less relevant but is subject to lower measurement uncertainty.
In those limited circumstances, the asset or liability would not be recognised.
the depiction of resulting income, expenses and changes in equity.
For example, if an entity acquires an asset in exchange for consideration, not recognising the asset would result in recognising expenses and would reduce the entity's profit and equity.
In some cases, for example, if the entity does not consume the asset immediately, that result could provide a misleading representation that the entity's financial position has deteriorated.
whether related assets and liabilities are recognised.
presentation and disclosure of information about the asset or liability, and resulting income, expenses or changes in equity.
A complete depiction includes all information necessary for a user of financial statements to understand the economic phenomenon depicted, including all necessary descriptions and explanations.
Hence, presentation and disclosure of related information can enable a recognised amount to form part of a faithful representation of an asset, a liability, equity, income or expenses.
Derecognition normally occurs when that item no longer meets the definition of an asset or of a liability
for an asset, derecognition normally occurs when the entity loses control of all or part of the recognised asset; and
for a liability, derecognition normally occurs when the entity no longer has a present obligation for all or part of the recognised liability.
derecognising any assets or liabilities that have expired or have been consumed, collected, fulfilled or transferred, and recognising any resulting income and expenses.
In the rest of this chapter, the term 'transferred component' refers to all those assets and liabilities;
continuing to recognise the assets or liabilities retained, referred to as the 'retained component', if any.
That retained component becomes a unit of account separate from the transferred component.
Accordingly, no income or expenses are recognised on the retained component as a result of the derecognition of the transferred component, unless the derecognition results in a change in the measurement requirements applicable to the retained component; and
presenting any retained component separately in the statement of financial position;
In those cases, derecognition of the transferred component might imply that the entity's financial position has changed more significantly than it has.
This might occur, for example
if an entity has retained exposure to significant positive or negative variations in the amount of economic benefits that may be produced by a transferred component that the entity no longer controls.
no income or expenses are recognised on either the retained component or the transferred component as a result of the transaction or other event;
the proceeds received (or paid) upon transfer of the asset (or liability) are treated as a loan received (or given); and
separate presentation of the transferred component in the statement of financial position, or provision of explanatory information, is needed to depict the fact that the entity no longer has any rights or obligations arising from the transferred component.
Similarly, it may be necessary to provide information about income or expenses arising from the transferred component after the transfer.
In deciding how to account for contract modifications, it is necessary to consider which unit of account provides users of financial statements with the most useful information about the assets and liabilities retained after the modification, and about how the modification changed the entity's assets and liabilities
if a contract modification both eliminates existing rights or obligations and adds new rights or obligations, it is necessary to consider both the separate and the combined effect of those modifications.
In some such cases, the contract has been modified to such an extent that, in substance, the modification replaces the old asset or liability with a new asset or liability.
In cases of such extensive modification, the entity may need to derecognise the original asset or liability, and recognise the new asset or liability.
Value in use and fulfilment value
Characteristics of the asset or liability
Contribution to future cash flows
A measurement basis is an identified feature — for example, historical cost, fair value or fulfilment value — of an item being measured.
Applying a measurement basis to an asset or liability creates a measure for that asset or liability and for related income and expenses.
specifying techniques that may or must be used to estimate a measure applying a particular measurement basis;
specifying a simplified measurement approach that is likely to provide information similar to that provided by a preferred measurement basis; or
explaining how to modify a measurement basis, for example, by excluding from the fulfilment value of a liability the effect of the possibility that the entity may fail to fulfil that liability (own credit risk).
The historical cost of a liability when it is incurred or taken on is the value of the consideration received to incur or take on the liability minus transaction costs.
In some such cases, a current value of the asset or liability is used as a deemed cost on initial recognition and that deemed cost is then used as a starting point for subsequent measurement at historical cost.
the consumption of part or all of the economic resource that constitutes the asset (depreciation or amortisation);
payments received that extinguish part or all of the asset;
the effect of events that cause part or all of the historical cost of the asset to be no longer recoverable (impairment); and
accrual of interest to reflect any financing component of the asset.
fulfilment of part or all of the liability, for example, by making payments that extinguish part or all of the liability or by satisfying an obligation to deliver goods;
accrual of interest to reflect any financing component of the liability.
The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability reflects estimates of future cash flows, discounted at a rate determined at initial recognition.
For variable rate instruments, the discount rate is updated to reflect changes in the variable rate.
Unlike historical cost, the current value of an asset or liability is not derived, even in part, from the price of the transaction or other event that gave rise to the asset or liability.
The asset or liability is measured using the same assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability if those market participants act in their economic best interest.
estimates of future cash flows.
possible variations in the estimated amount or timing of future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured, caused by the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows.
the time value of money.
the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows (a risk premium or risk discount).
The price for bearing that uncertainty depends on the extent of that uncertainty.
It also reflects the fact that investors would generally pay less for an asset (and generally require more for taking on a liability) that has uncertain cash flows than for an asset (or liability) whose cash flows are certain.
other factors, for example, liquidity, if market participants would take those factors into account in the circumstances.
In addition, fair value does not reflect the transaction costs that would be incurred on the ultimate disposal of the asset or on transferring or settling the liability.
Those amounts of cash or other economic resources include not only the amounts to be transferred to the liability counterparty, but also the amounts that the entity expects to be obliged to transfer to other parties to enable it to fulfil the liability.
However, value in use and fulfilment value include the present value of any transaction costs an entity expects to incur on the ultimate disposal of the asset or on fulfilling the liability.
In practice, there may sometimes be little difference between the assumptions that market participants would use and those that an entity itself uses.
The current cost of a liability is the consideration that would be received for an equivalent liability at the measurement date minus the transaction costs that would be incurred at that date.
Current cost, like historical cost, is an entry value: it reflects prices in the market in which the entity would acquire the asset or would incur the liability.
Hence, it is different from fair value, value in use and fulfilment value, which are exit values.
However, unlike historical cost, current cost reflects conditions at the measurement date.
For example, if prices are available only for new assets, the current cost of a used asset might need to be estimated by adjusting the current price of a new asset to reflect the current age and condition of the asset held by the entity.
Information provided by particular measurement bases
Hence, measuring an asset or liability at historical cost in such cases provides relevant information about both the asset or liability and the price of the transaction that gave rise to that asset or liability.
Similarly, because the historical cost of a liability is increased when it becomes onerous, the value of the obligation to transfer the economic resources needed to fulfil the liability is no more than the carrying amount of the liability.
The difference between the income and the expense is the margin resulting from the sale.
Expenses arising from consumption of an asset can be compared to related income to provide information about margins.
The difference between that income and the expenses incurred in fulfilling the liability is the margin resulting from the fulfilment.
That information can be used as an input in predicting future margins from the future sale of goods (including goods not currently held by the entity) and services and hence to assess the entity's prospects for future net cash inflows.
To assess an entity's prospects for future cash flows, users of financial statements often focus on the entity's prospects for generating future margins over many periods, not just on its prospects for generating margins from goods already held.
Income and expenses measured at historical cost may also have confirmatory value because they may provide feedback to users of financial statements about their previous predictions of cash flows or of margins.
Information about the cost of assets sold or consumed may also help in an assessment of how efficiently and effectively the entity's management has discharged its responsibilities to use the entity's economic resources.
These expectations are priced in a manner that reflects the current risk preferences of market participants.
That information may also have confirmatory value by providing feedback about previous expectations.
Such income and expenses may also help in an assessment of how efficiently and effectively the entity's management has discharged its responsibilities to use the entity's economic resources.
When those factors have different characteristics, identifying separately income and expenses that result from those factors can provide useful information to users of financial statements (see paragraph 7.14(b)).
In those cases, if the asset or liability is measured at fair value, the net income or net expenses arising at the time of the sale or transfer would usually be small, unless the effect of transaction costs is significant.
This information may have predictive value because it can be used in assessing the prospects for future net cash inflows.
Hence, fulfilment value may have predictive value, particularly if the liability will be fulfilled, rather than transferred or settled by negotiation.
That information can be used to derive current margins and can be used as an input in predicting future margins.
Unlike historical cost, current cost reflects prices prevailing at the time of consumption or fulfilment.
When price changes are significant, margins based on current cost may be more useful for predicting future margins than margins based on historical cost.

Factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis
The relative importance of each factor will depend on facts and circumstances.
To achieve this, the information must be relevant and it must faithfully represent what it purports to represent.
In addition, the information provided should be, as far as possible, comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable.
If that information is not available or cannot be provided in a way that faithfully represents the economic phenomenon, the next most relevant type of information is considered.
Some of that discussion may also apply in selecting a measurement basis for information provided in the notes, for recognised or unrecognised items.
Recognising such income and expenses might appear to depict a transaction or other event when, in fact, no such transaction or event has occurred.
Hence, the choice of measurement basis for an asset or liability, and for the related income and expenses, is determined by considering both initial measurement and subsequent measurement.
Consequently, historical cost may not provide relevant information if information about changes in value is important to users of financial statements.
For example, amortised cost cannot provide relevant information about a financial asset or financial liability that is a derivative.
This could be incorrectly interpreted as implying that all the income and expenses recognised at the time of that event arose then, rather than over the periods during which the asset or liability was held.
Moreover, because measurement at historical cost does not provide timely information about changes in value, income and expenses reported on that basis may lack predictive value and confirmatory value by not depicting the full effect of the entity's exposure to risk arising from holding the asset or liability during the reporting period.
This may be the case when the entity's business activities do not involve selling the asset or transferring the liability, for example, if the entity holds assets solely for use or solely for collecting contractual cash flows or if the entity is to fulfil liabilities itself.
How economic resources are used, and hence how assets and liabilities produce cash flows, depends in part on the nature of the business activities conducted by the entity.
For example, property, plant and equipment is typically used in combination with an entity's other economic resources.
Similarly, inventory typically cannot be sold to a customer, except by making extensive use of the entity's other economic resources (for example, in production and marketing activities).
However, in assessing whether amortised cost will provide useful information, it is also necessary to consider the characteristics of the financial asset or financial liability.
Amortised cost is unlikely to provide relevant information about cash flows that depend on factors other than principal and interest.
If financial statements contain measurement inconsistencies, those financial statements may not faithfully represent some aspects of the entity's financial position and financial performance.
Consequently, in some circumstances, using the same measurement basis for related assets and liabilities may provide users of financial statements with information that is more useful than the information that would result from using different measurement bases.
The level of measurement uncertainty associated with a particular measurement basis may affect whether information provided by that measurement basis provides a faithful representation of an entity's financial position and financial performance.
In such cases, it is appropriate to consider selecting a different measurement basis that would also result in relevant information.
outcome uncertainty arises when there is uncertainty about the amount or timing of any inflow or outflow of economic benefits that will result from an asset or liability.
existence uncertainty arises when it is uncertain whether an asset or a liability exists.
For example, if the fair value of an asset can be determined directly by observing prices in an active market, no measurement uncertainty is associated with the measurement of that fair value, even if it is uncertain how much cash the asset will ultimately produce and hence there is outcome uncertainty.
The following paragraphs discuss those implications.
The enhancing qualitative characteristic of timeliness has no specific implications for measurement.
Hence, in selecting a measurement basis, it is important to consider whether the benefits of the information provided to users of financial statements by that measurement basis are likely to justify the costs of providing and using that information.
If a change is made, users of financial statements may need explanatory information to enable them to understand the effect of that change.
However, it could be appropriate to use more measurement bases if that is necessary to provide useful information.
If a measure cannot be verified, users of financial statements may need explanatory information to enable them to understand how the measure was determined.
In some such cases, it may be necessary to specify the use of a different measurement basis.
In addition, measures determined applying a historical cost measurement basis are generally well understood and, in many cases, verifiable.
This can reduce comparability, both from period to period for a reporting entity and in a single period across entities.
This can enhance comparability both from period to period for a reporting entity and in a single period across entities.
In contrast, because value in use and fulfilment value reflect an entity-specific perspective, those measures could differ for identical assets or liabilities in different entities.
Those differences may reduce comparability, particularly if the assets or liabilities contribute to cash flows in a similar manner.
estimating inputs to the valuation and applying the valuation technique may be costly and complex.
the inputs into the process may be subjective and it may be difficult to verify both the inputs and the validity of the process itself.
In addition, estimates of value in use for an asset may inadvertently reflect the effect of synergies with other assets in the group.
For these reasons, value in use may not be a practical measurement basis for regular remeasurements of such assets.
This can enhance comparability, both from period to period for a reporting entity and in a single period across entities.
However, determining current cost can be complex, subjective and costly.
In addition, because of changes in technology and changes in business practices, many assets would not be replaced with identical assets.
Thus, a further subjective adjustment to the current price of a new asset would be required in order to estimate the current cost of an asset equivalent to the existing asset.
Because of these difficulties, current cost measures may lack verifiability and understandability.
If historical cost will be used subsequently, that measurement basis is also normally appropriate at initial recognition.
Similarly, if a current value will be used subsequently, it is also normally appropriate at initial recognition.
When an asset or liability is measured at cost, no income or expenses arise at initial recognition, unless income or expenses arise from the derecognition of the transferred asset or liability, or unless the asset is impaired or the liability is onerous.
an asset may be granted to the entity free of charge by a government or donated to the entity by another party;
a liability may be imposed by legislation or regulation; or
a liability to pay compensation or a penalty may arise from an act of wrongdoing.
Any difference between that deemed cost and any consideration given or received would be recognised as income or expenses at initial recognition.
to provide in the notes additional information applying a different measurement basis.
a current value measurement basis for the asset or liability in the statement of financial position; and
the statement of profit or loss includes the income or expenses measured applying the measurement basis selected for that statement; and
other comprehensive income includes all the remaining income or expenses.
As a result, the accumulated other comprehensive income related to that asset or liability equals the difference between
the carrying amount of the asset or liability in the statement of financial position; and
the carrying amount that would have been determined applying the measurement basis selected for the statement of profit or loss.
It equals the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised assets less the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised liabilities.
the aggregate market value of equity claims on the entity;
the amount that could be raised by selling the entity as a whole on a going concern basis; or
the amount that could be raised by selling all of the entity's assets and settling all of its liabilities.
Hence, when using such a technique, it is necessary to identify which measurement basis is used and the extent to which the technique reflects the factors applicable to that measurement basis.
Modifying measurement bases may sometimes result in information that is more relevant to the users of financial statements or that may be less costly to produce or to understand.
Those uncertainties are important characteristics of assets and liabilities.
Those variations are considered in selecting a single amount from within the range of possible cash flows.
The amount selected is itself sometimes the amount of a possible outcome, but this is not always the case.
The amount that provides the most relevant information is usually one from within the central part of the range (a central estimate).
Different central estimates provide different information.
the expected value (the probability-weighted average, also known as the statistical mean) reflects the entire range of outcomes and gives more weight to the outcomes that are more likely.
The expected value is not intended to predict the ultimate inflow or outflow of cash or other economic benefits arising from that asset or liability.
the most likely outcome (the statistical mode) is the single most likely ultimate inflow or outflow arising from an asset or liability.
Hence users may need information about the range of possible outcomes.
Profit or loss and other comprehensive income
A reporting entity communicates information about its assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses by presenting and disclosing information in its financial statements.
It also enhances the understandability and comparability of information in financial statements.
Effective communication of information in financial statements requires
focusing on presentation and disclosure objectives and principles rather than focusing on rules;
classifying information in a manner that groups similar items and separates dissimilar items; and
aggregating information in such a way that it is not obscured either by unnecessary detail or by excessive aggregation.
Hence, in making decisions about presentation and disclosure, it is important to consider whether the benefits provided to users of financial statements by presenting or disclosing particular information are likely to justify the costs of providing and using that information.
Presentation and disclosure objectives and principles
giving entities the flexibility to provide relevant information that faithfully represents the entity's assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses; and
requiring information that is comparable, both from period to period for a reporting entity and in a single reporting period across entities.
entity-specific information is more useful than standardised descriptions, sometimes referred to as 'boilerplate'; and
duplication of information in different parts of the financial statements is usually unnecessary and can make financial statements less understandable.
However, it may sometimes be appropriate to separate an asset or liability into components that have different characteristics and to classify those components separately.
That would be appropriate when classifying those components separately would enhance the usefulness of the resulting financial information.
For example, it could be appropriate to separate an asset or liability into current and non-current components and to classify those components separately.
Offsetting classifies dissimilar items together and therefore is generally not appropriate.
Separate presentation or disclosure of those reserves may provide useful information.
income and expenses resulting from the unit of account selected for an asset or liability; or
components of such income and expenses if those components have different characteristics and are identified separately.
It would be appropriate to classify those components separately if doing so would enhance the usefulness of the resulting financial information.
outside the statement of profit or loss, in other comprehensive income.
That statement contains a total for profit or loss that provides a highly summarised depiction of the entity's financial performance for the period.
Many users of financial statements incorporate that total in their analysis either as a starting point for that analysis or as the main indicator of the entity's financial performance for the period.
However, in developing Standards, the Board may decide in exceptional circumstances that income or expenses arising from a change in the current value of an asset or liability are to be included in other comprehensive income when doing so would result in the statement of profit or loss providing more relevant information, or providing a more faithful representation of the entity's financial performance for that period.
That is also the case when income and expenses of that type are separately identified as a component of a change in the current value of an asset or liability.
For example, if a financial asset is measured at current value and if interest income is identified separately from other changes in value, that interest income is included in the statement of profit or loss.
However, if, for example, there is no clear basis for identifying the period in which reclassification would have that result, or the amount that should be reclassified, the Board may, in developing Standards, decide that income and expenses included in other comprehensive income are not to be subsequently reclassified.
Hence, a balance needs to be found so that relevant information is not obscured either by a large amount of insignificant detail or by excessive aggregation.
Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity.
Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day.
Thus, a financial concept of capital should be adopted if the users of financial statements are primarily concerned with the maintenance of nominal invested capital or the purchasing power of invested capital.
If, however, the main concern of users is with the operating capability of the entity, a physical concept of capital should be used.
The concept chosen indicates the goal to be attained in determining profit, even though there may be some measurement difficulties in making the concept operational.
Concepts of capital maintenance and the determination of profit
Under this concept a profit is earned only if the financial (or money) amount of the net assets at the end of the period exceeds the financial (or money) amount of net assets at the beginning of the period, after excluding any distributions to, and contributions from, owners during the period.
Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units or units of constant purchasing power.
Under this concept a profit is earned only if the physical productive capacity (or operating capability) of the entity (or the resources or funds needed to achieve that capacity) at the end of the period exceeds the physical productive capacity at the beginning of the period, after excluding any distributions to, and contributions from, owners during the period.
Hence, profit is the residual amount that remains after expenses (including capital maintenance adjustments, where appropriate) have been deducted from income.
If expenses exceed income the residual amount is a loss.
The financial capital maintenance concept, however, does not require the use of a particular basis of measurement.
Selection of the basis under this concept is dependent on the type of financial capital that the entity is seeking to maintain.
In general terms, an entity has maintained its capital if it has as much capital at the end of the period as it had at the beginning of the period.
Any amount over and above that required to maintain the capital at the beginning of the period is profit.
Thus, increases in the prices of assets held over the period, conventionally referred to as holding gains, are, conceptually, profits.
They may not be recognised as such, however, until the assets are disposed of in an exchange transaction.
When the concept of financial capital maintenance is defined in terms of constant purchasing power units, profit represents the increase in invested purchasing power over the period.
Thus, only that part of the increase in the prices of assets that exceeds the increase in the general level of prices is regarded as profit.
The rest of the increase is treated as a capital maintenance adjustment and, hence, as part of equity.
Different accounting models exhibit different degrees of relevance and reliability and, as in other areas, management must seek a balance between relevance and reliability.
This Conceptual Framework is applicable to a range of accounting models and provides guidance on preparing and presenting the financial statements constructed under the chosen model.
At the present time, it is not the intention of the Board to prescribe a particular model other than in exceptional circumstances, such as for those entities reporting in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy.
This intention will, however, be reviewed in the light of world developments.
While these increases or decreases meet the definition of income and expenses, they are not included in the income statement under certain concepts of capital maintenance.
Instead these items are included in equity as capital maintenance adjustments or revaluation reserves.
The following defined terms are extracted or derived from the relevant paragraphs of the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting.

Throughout the Conceptual Framework, the terms 'qualitative characteristics' and 'cost constraint' refer to the qualitative characteristics of, and the cost constraint on, useful financial information.
They are the elements of financial statements.
Throughout the Conceptual Framework, the term 'financial statements' refers to general purpose financial statements.
(a) This column summarises the information provided if value in use is used as a measurement basis.
However, as noted in paragraph 6.75, value in use may not be a practical measurement basis for regular remeasurements.
(c) Income or expenses may arise if the market in which an asset is acquired is different from the market that is the source of the prices used when measuring the fair value of the asset.
The Conceptual Framework uses the term 'statement of profit or loss' to refer both to a separate statement and to a separate section within a single statement of financial performance.
The Conceptual Framework uses the term 'statement of profit or loss' to refer to a separate statement and to a separate section within a single statement of financial performance.
Likewise, it uses the term 'total for profit or loss' to refer both to a total for a separate statement and to a subtotal for a section within a single statement of financial performance.
(iii)have similar economic characteristics and risks and hence are likely to have similar implications for the prospects for future net cash inflows to the entity or net cash outflows from the entity; or
This may, for example, occur upon the public listing of an entity's equity instruments or upon the restructuring of an entity's equity.
It may also occur upon a controlling shareholder's move to a foreign country.
The change may also increase or decrease the deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the entity, depending on the effect the change in tax status has on the tax consequences that will arise from recovering or settling the carrying amount of the entity's assets and liabilities.
The current and deferred tax consequences of a change in tax status shall be included in profit or loss for the period, unless those consequences relate to transactions and events that result, in the same or a different period, in a direct credit or charge to the recognised amount of equity or in amounts recognised in other comprehensive income.
Those tax consequences that relate to changes in the recognised amount of equity, in the same or a different period (not included in profit or loss), shall be charged or credited directly to equity.
Those tax consequences that relate to amounts recognised in other comprehensive income shall be recognised in other comprehensive income.

recognises any investment retained in the former subsidiary and subsequently accounts for it and for any amounts owed by or to the former subsidiary in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
That retained interest is remeasured, as described in paragraphs B98(b)(iii) and B99A.
recognises the gain or loss associated with the loss of control attributable to the former controlling interest, as specified in paragraphs B98-B99A.
In Appendix B, paragraph B99A is added.
The gain or loss resulting from the transaction (including the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income that would be reclassified to profit or loss in accordance with paragraph B99) is recognised in the parent's profit or loss only to the extent of the unrelated investors' interests in that associate or joint venture.
The remaining part of the gain is eliminated against the carrying amount of the investment in that associate or joint venture.
In addition, if the parent retains an investment in the former subsidiary and the former subsidiary is now an associate or a joint venture that is accounted for using the equity method, the parent recognises the part of the gain or loss resulting from the remeasurement at fair value of the investment retained in that former subsidiary in its profit or loss only to the extent of the unrelated investors' interests in the new associate or joint venture.
The remaining part of that gain is eliminated against the carrying amount of the investment retained in the former subsidiary.
As a consequence of this transaction the parent loses control of the subsidiary.
According to paragraph B99A, the parent recognises in its profit or loss the amount of the gain attributable to the unrelated investors' interests in the existing associate.
(b)  the gain (CU60) resulting from the remeasurement at fair value of the investment directly retained in the former subsidiary.
According to paragraph B99A, the parent recognises in its profit or loss the amount of the gain attributable to the unrelated investors' interests in the new associate.
Additional temporary exceptions arising from interest rate benchmark reform
when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the hedged risk and the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item and of the hedging instrument; and
when changes required by interest rate benchmark reform are made to the non-contractually specified risk portion applying paragraph 102P; or
when the hedging relationship in which the non-contractually specified risk portion is designated is discontinued.
designating an alternative benchmark rate (contractually or non-contractually specified) as a hedged risk;
amending the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged;
amending the description of the hedging instrument; or
the entity makes a change required by interest rate benchmark reform using an approach other than changing the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedging instrument (as described in paragraph 5.4.6 of IFRS 9);
Therefore, applying paragraph 102P, an entity may be required to amend the formal designation of its hedging relationships at different times, or may be required to amend the formal designation of a hedging relationship more than once.
An entity shall amend a hedging relationship as required in paragraph 102P by the end of the reporting period during which a change required by interest rate benchmark reform is made to the hedged risk, hedged item or hedging instrument.
For the avoidance of doubt, such an amendment to the formal designation of a hedging relationship constitutes neither the discontinuation of the hedging relationship nor the designation of a new hedging relationship.
If the additional changes do not result in the discontinuation of hedge accounting, an entity shall amend the formal designation of the hedging relationship as specified in paragraph 102P.
This election is made separately for each hedging relationship (ie on an individual hedging relationship basis).
For the purpose of applying paragraph 97, at the point when an entity amends the description of a hedged item as required in paragraph 102P(b), the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income shall be deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows are determined.
For a discontinued hedging relationship, when the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged future cash flows had been based is changed as required by interest rate benchmark reform, for the purpose of applying paragraph 101(c) in order to determine whether the hedged future cash flows are expected to occur, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income for that hedging relationship shall be deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows will be based.
When an entity applies paragraph 102P to groups of items designated as hedged items in a fair value or cash flow hedge, the entity shall allocate the hedged items to subgroups based on the benchmark rate being hedged and designate the benchmark rate as the hedged risk for each subgroup.
For example, in a hedging relationship in which a group of items is hedged for changes in an interest rate benchmark subject to interest rate benchmark reform, the hedged cash flows or fair value of some items in the group could be changed to reference an alternative benchmark rate before other items in the group are changed.
In this example, in applying paragraph 102P, the entity would designate the alternative benchmark rate as the hedged risk for that relevant subgroup of hedged items.
The entity would continue to designate the existing interest rate benchmark as the hedged risk for the other subgroup of hedged items until the hedged cash flows or fair value of those items are changed to reference the alternative benchmark rate or the items expire and are replaced with hedged items that reference the alternative benchmark rate.
An entity shall designate a new hedging relationship (for example, as described in paragraph 102Z3) only prospectively (ie an entity is prohibited from designating a new hedge accounting relationship in prior periods).
However, an entity shall reinstate a discontinued hedging relationship if, and only if, these conditions are met
the entity had discontinued that hedging relationship solely due to changes required by interest rate benchmark reform and the entity would not have been required to discontinue that hedging relationship if these amendments had been applied at that time; and
at the beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies these amendments (date of initial application of these amendments), that discontinued hedging relationship meets the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting (after taking into account these amendments).
Depreciable amount and depreciation period
The principal issues in accounting for property, plant and equipment are the recognition of the assets, the determination of their carrying amounts and the depreciation charges and impairment losses to be recognised in relation to them.
mineral rights and mineral reserves such as oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources.
However, this Standard applies to property, plant and equipment used to develop or maintain the assets described in (b)–(d).
Carrying amount is the amount at which an asset is recognised after deducting any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value.
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.
Entity-specific value is the present value of the cash flows an entity expects to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life or expects to incur when settling a liability.
An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Property, plant and equipment are tangible items that
Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
The residual value of an asset is the estimated amount that an entity would currently obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.
the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by an entity.
the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Otherwise, such items are classified as inventory.
Thus, judgement is required in applying the recognition criteria to an entity's specific circumstances.
It may be appropriate to aggregate individually insignificant items, such as moulds, tools and dies, and to apply the criteria to the aggregate value.
These costs include costs incurred initially to acquire or construct an item of property, plant and equipment and costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment may include costs incurred relating to leases of assets that are used to construct, add to, replace part of or service an item of property, plant and equipment, such as depreciation of right-of-use assets.
The acquisition of such property, plant and equipment, although not directly increasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may be necessary for an entity to obtain the future economic benefits from its other assets.
Such items of property, plant and equipment qualify for recognition as assets because they enable an entity to derive future economic benefits from related assets in excess of what could be derived had those items not been acquired.
Rather, these costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
The purpose of these expenditures is often described as for the 'repairs and maintenance' of the item of property, plant and equipment.
Items of property, plant and equipment may also be acquired to make a less frequently recurring replacement, such as replacing the interior walls of a building, or to make a nonrecurring replacement.
When each major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.
Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is derecognised.
This occurs regardless of whether the cost of the previous inspection was identified in the transaction in which the item was acquired or constructed.
If necessary, the estimated cost of a future similar inspection may be used as an indication of what the cost of the existing inspection component was when the item was acquired or constructed.
its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates.
any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.
initial delivery and handling costs;
costs of opening a new facility;
costs of introducing a new product or service (including costs of advertising and promotional activities);
administration and other general overhead costs.
Therefore, costs incurred in using or redeploying an item are not included in the carrying amount of that item.
For example, the following costs are not included in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment
costs incurred while an item capable of operating in the manner intended by management has yet to be brought into use or is operated at less than full capacity;
costs of relocating or reorganising part or all of an entity's operations.
These incidental operations may occur before or during the construction or development activities.
For example, income may be earned through using a building site as a car park until construction starts.
Because incidental operations are not necessary to bring an item to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the income and related expenses of incidental operations are recognised in profit or loss and included in their respective classifications of income and expense.
If an entity makes similar assets for sale in the normal course of business, the cost of the asset is usually the same as the cost of constructing an asset for sale (see IAS 2).
Therefore, any internal profits are eliminated in arriving at such costs.
Similarly, the cost of abnormal amounts of wasted material, labour, or other resources incurred in self-constructing an asset is not included in the cost of the asset.
Bearer plants are accounted for in the same way as self-constructed items of property, plant and equipment before they are in the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Consequently, references to 'construction' in this Standard should be read as covering activities that are necessary to cultivate the bearer plants before they are in the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
The cost of such an item of property, plant and equipment is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable.
The acquired item is measured in this way even if an entity cannot immediately derecognise the asset given up.
If the acquired item is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up.
the difference in (a) or (b) is significant relative to the fair value of the assets exchanged.
For the purpose of determining whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance, the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity's operations affected by the transaction shall reflect post-tax cash flows.
The result of these analyses may be clear without an entity having to perform detailed calculations.
If an entity is able to measure reliably the fair value of either the asset received or the asset given up, then the fair value of the asset given up is used to measure the cost of the asset received unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident.
Revaluations shall be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period.
When the fair value of a revalued asset differs materially from its carrying amount, a further revaluation is required.
Such frequent revaluations are unnecessary for items of property, plant and equipment with only insignificant changes in fair value.
the gross carrying amount is adjusted in a manner that is consistent with the revaluation of the carrying amount of the asset.
For example, the gross carrying amount may be restated by reference to observable market data or it may be restated proportionately to the change in the carrying amount.
The accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is adjusted to equal the difference between the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount of the asset after taking into account accumulated impairment losses; or
the accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset.
The following are examples of separate classes
However, a class of assets may be revalued on a rolling basis provided revaluation of the class of assets is completed within a short period and provided the revaluations are kept up to date.
However, the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
However, the decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset.
The decrease recognised in other comprehensive income reduces the amount accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus.
This may involve transferring the whole of the surplus when the asset is retired or disposed of.
However, some of the surplus may be transferred as the asset is used by an entity.
In such a case, the amount of the surplus transferred would be the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation based on the asset's original cost.
Transfers from revaluation surplus to retained earnings are not made through profit or loss.
For example, it may be appropriate to depreciate separately the airframe and engines of an aircraft.
Such parts may be grouped in determining the depreciation charge.
The remainder consists of the parts of the item that are individually not significant.
If an entity has varying expectations for these parts, approximation techniques may be necessary to depreciate the remainder in a manner that faithfully represents the consumption pattern and/or useful life of its parts.
However, sometimes, the future economic benefits embodied in an asset are absorbed in producing other assets.
In this case, the depreciation charge constitutes part of the cost of the other asset and is included in its carrying amount.
For example, the depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment is included in the costs of conversion of inventories (see IAS 2).
Repair and maintenance of an asset do not negate the need to depreciate it.
In practice, the residual value of an asset is often insignificant and therefore immaterial in the calculation of the depreciable amount.
Therefore, depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated.
However, other factors, such as technical or commercial obsolescence and wear and tear while an asset remains idle, often result in the diminution of the economic benefits that might have been obtained from the asset.
Consequently, all the following factors are considered in determining the useful life of an asset
Usage is assessed by reference to the asset's expected capacity or physical output.
expected physical wear and tear, which depends on operational factors such as the number of shifts for which the asset is to be used and the repair and maintenance programme, and the care and maintenance of the asset while idle.
technical or commercial obsolescence arising from changes or improvements in production, or from a change in the market demand for the product or service output of the asset.
Expected future reductions in the selling price of an item that was produced using an asset could indicate the expectation of technical or commercial obsolescence of the asset, which, in turn, might reflect a reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
legal or similar limits on the use of the asset, such as the expiry dates of related leases.
The asset management policy of the entity may involve the disposal of assets after a specified time or after consumption of a specified proportion of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
Therefore, the useful life of an asset may be shorter than its economic life.
The estimation of the useful life of the asset is a matter of judgement based on the experience of the entity with similar assets.
With some exceptions, such as quarries and sites used for landfill, land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated.
Buildings have a limited useful life and therefore are depreciable assets.
An increase in the value of the land on which a building stands does not affect the determination of the depreciable amount of the building.
In some cases, the land itself may have a limited useful life, in which case it is depreciated in a manner that reflects the benefits to be derived from it.
These methods include the straight-line method, the diminishing balance method and the units of production method.
Straight-line depreciation results in a constant charge over the useful life if the asset's residual value does not change.
The diminishing balance method results in a decreasing charge over the useful life.
The units of production method results in a charge based on the expected use or output.
The entity selects the method that most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
That method is applied consistently from period to period unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits.
A depreciation method that is based on revenue that is generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset is not appropriate.
The revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits of the asset.
For example, revenue is affected by other inputs and processes, selling activities and changes in sales volumes and prices.
The price component of revenue may be affected by inflation, which has no bearing upon the way in which an asset is consumed.
That Standard explains how an entity reviews the carrying amount of its assets, how it determines the recoverable amount of an asset, and when it recognises, or reverses the recognition of, an impairment loss.
derecognition of items of property, plant and equipment retired or disposed of is determined in accordance with this Standard;
the cost of items of property, plant and equipment restored, purchased or constructed as replacements is determined in accordance with this Standard.
when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Gains shall not be classified as revenue.
However, an entity that, in the course of its ordinary activities, routinely sells items of property, plant and equipment that it has held for rental to others shall transfer such assets to inventories at their carrying amount when they cease to be rented and become held for sale.
If it is not practicable for an entity to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, it may use the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of the replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed.
the measurement bases used for determining the gross carrying amount;
the useful lives or the depreciation rates used;
(iii) acquisitions through business combinations;
the existence and amounts of restrictions on title, and property, plant and equipment pledged as security for liabilities;
the amount of expenditures recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment in the course of its construction;
Therefore, disclosure of the methods adopted and the estimated useful lives or depreciation rates provides users of financial statements with information that allows them to review the policies selected by management and enables comparisons to be made with other entities.
For similar reasons, it is necessary to disclose
accumulated depreciation at the end of the period.
For property, plant and equipment, such disclosure may arise from changes in estimates with respect to
the estimated costs of dismantling, removing or restoring items of property, plant and equipment;
whether an independent valuer was involved;
the revaluation surplus, indicating the change for the period and any restrictions on the distribution of the balance to shareholders.
the carrying amount of temporarily idle property, plant and equipment;
the gross carrying amount of any fully depreciated property, plant and equipment that is still in use;
when the cost model is used, the fair value of property, plant and equipment when this is materially different from the carrying amount.
Therefore, entities are encouraged to disclose these amounts.
An entity may also present adjusted comparative information for any earlier periods presented, but it is not required to do so.
If an entity presents unadjusted comparative information for any earlier periods, it shall clearly identify the information that has not been adjusted, state that it has been presented on a different basis and explain that basis.
Any difference between the previous carrying amount and fair value shall be recognised in opening retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
An entity shall apply those amendments retrospectively, in accordance with IAS 8, except as specified in paragraph 80C.
The infrastructure may already exist, or may be constructed during the period of the service arrangement.
An arrangement within the scope of this Interpretation typically involves a private sector entity (an operator) constructing the infrastructure used to provide the public service or upgrading it (for example, by increasing its capacity) and operating and maintaining that infrastructure for a specified period of time.
The operator is paid for its services over the period of the arrangement.
The arrangement is governed by a contract that sets out performance standards, mechanisms for adjusting prices, and arrangements for arbitrating disputes.
Public policy is for the services related to the infrastructure to be provided to the public, irrespective of the identity of the party that operates the services.
The service arrangement contractually obliges the operator to provide the services to the public on behalf of the public sector entity.
the party that grants the service arrangement (the grantor) is a public sector entity, including a governmental body, or a private sector entity to which the responsibility for the service has been devolved.
the operator is responsible for at least some of the management of the infrastructure and related services and does not merely act as an agent on behalf of the grantor.
the contract sets the initial prices to be levied by the operator and regulates price revisions over the period of the service arrangement.
the operator is obliged to hand over the infrastructure to the grantor in a specified condition at the end of the period of the arrangement, for little or no incremental consideration, irrespective of which party initially financed it.
existing infrastructure to which the grantor gives the operator access for the purpose of the service arrangement.
The derecognition requirements of IFRSs (set out in IAS 16) apply to such infrastructure.
Requirements for disclosing information about service concession arrangements are in SIC-29.
treatment of the operator's rights over the infrastructure;
recognition and measurement of arrangement consideration;
items provided to the operator by the grantor.
Treatment of the operator's rights over the infrastructure
The operator has access to operate the infrastructure to provide the public service on behalf of the grantor in accordance with the terms specified in the contract.
Recognition and measurement of arrangement consideration
The operator constructs or upgrades infrastructure (construction or upgrade services) used to provide a public service and operates and maintains that infrastructure (operation services) for a specified period of time.
The nature of the consideration determines its subsequent accounting treatment.
Consideration given by the grantor to the operator
The consideration may be rights to
The operator has an unconditional right to receive cash if the grantor contractually guarantees to pay the operator (a) specified or determinable amounts or (b) the shortfall, if any, between amounts received from users of the public service and specified or determinable amounts, even if payment is contingent on the operator ensuring that the infrastructure meets specified quality or efficiency requirements.
A right to charge users of the public service is not an unconditional right to receive cash because the amounts are contingent on the extent that the public uses the service.
Contractual obligations to restore the infrastructure to a specified level of serviceability
Borrowing costs incurred by the operator
In this case borrowing costs attributable to the arrangement shall be capitalised during the construction phase of the arrangement in accordance with that Standard.
Items provided to the operator by the grantor
The grantor may also provide other items to the operator that the operator can keep or deal with as it wishes.
recognise financial assets and intangible assets that existed at the start of the earliest period presented;
test financial and intangible assets recognised at that date for impairment, unless this is not practicable, in which case the amounts shall be tested for impairment as at the start of the current period.
This appendix is an integral part of the Interpretation.
The control or regulation referred to in condition (a) could be by contract or otherwise (such as through a regulator), and includes circumstances in which the grantor buys all of the output as well as those in which some or all of the output is bought by other users.
In applying this condition, the grantor and any related parties shall be considered together.
If the grantor is a public sector entity, the public sector as a whole, together with any regulators acting in the public interest, shall be regarded as related to the grantor for the purposes of this Interpretation.
For the purpose of condition (a), the grantor does not need to have complete control of the price: it is sufficient for the price to be regulated by the grantor, contract or regulator, for example by a capping mechanism.
However, the condition shall be applied to the substance of the agreement.
Conversely, if for example, a contract purports to give the operator freedom to set prices, but any excess profit is returned to the grantor, the operator's return is capped and the price element of the control test is met.
For the purpose of condition (b), the grantor's control over any significant residual interest should both restrict the operator's practical ability to sell or pledge the infrastructure and give the grantor a continuing right of use throughout the period of the arrangement.
The residual interest in the infrastructure is the estimated current value of the infrastructure as if it were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of the period of the arrangement.
Control should be distinguished from management.
If the grantor retains both the degree of control described in paragraph 5(a) and any significant residual interest in the infrastructure, the operator is only managing the infrastructure on the grantor's behalf — even though, in many cases, it may have wide managerial discretion.
For example, if the operator has to replace part of an item of infrastructure during the period of the arrangement (eg the top layer of a road or the roof of a building), the item of infrastructure shall be considered as a whole.
Thus condition (b) is met for the whole of the infrastructure, including the part that is replaced, if the grantor controls any significant residual interest in the final replacement of that part.
Sometimes the use of infrastructure is partly regulated in the manner described in paragraph 5(a) and partly unregulated.
The operator may have a right to use the separable infrastructure described in paragraph AG7(a), or the facilities used to provide ancillary unregulated services described in paragraph AG7(b).

Reassessment of variable lease payments
It includes the reasons for accepting particular views and rejecting others.
It did not require lessees to recognise assets and liabilities arising from operating leases, but it did require lessees to recognise assets and liabilities arising from finance leases.
Many users adjusted a lessee's financial statements to capitalise operating leases because, in their view, the financing and assets provided by leases should be reflected on the statement of financial position ('balance sheet').
Some tried to estimate the present value of future lease payments.
Other users were unable to make adjustments — they relied on data sources such as data aggregators when screening potential investments or making investment decisions.
These different approaches created information asymmetry in the market.
The IASB concluded that such an approach will result in a more faithful representation of a lessee's assets and liabilities and, together with enhanced disclosures, greater transparency of a lessee's financial leverage and capital employed.
Feedback on the Discussion Paper generally supported the 'right-of-use' model for lessees, by which a lessee would recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease.
The Discussion Paper did not discuss lessor accounting in any detail.
further developed the 'right-of-use' accounting model for lessees that had been proposed in the Discussion Paper, and that respondents had generally supported.
added proposals for changes to lessor accounting.
The Boards decided to include lessor accounting in the proposals in response to comments from respondents to the Discussion Paper.
Some respondents had recommended that the Boards develop accounting models for lessees and lessors on the basis of a consistent rationale.
Of particular note was its proposal that in estimating the lease payments, a lessee should
assume the longest possible term that was more likely than not to occur, taking into account any options to extend or terminate the lease; and
include an estimate of variable lease payments, if those payments could be measured reliably.
Round table discussions were held in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Workshops were organised in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the UK and the US.
The purpose of the targeted outreach was to obtain additional feedback to assist the Boards in developing particular aspects of the revised proposals.
The targeted outreach meetings involved international working group members, representatives from accounting firms, local standard-setters, users and preparers of financial statements, particularly those from industries most affected by the lease accounting proposals.
However, others did not support these effects because they thought that they would not properly reflect the economics of all lease transactions.
In particular, some respondents referred to shorter-term property leases as examples of leases that, in their view, were not financing transactions from either the lessee's or lessor's perspective.
many respondents disagreed with the proposals for lessor accounting
some respondents were concerned that the dual accounting model proposed for lessors was not consistent with the single accounting model proposed for lessees.
almost all respondents were concerned about the cost and complexity of the proposals, in particular the proposals regarding the measurement of the lessee's lease liability and the lessor's lease receivable.
Some questioned whether lease payments to be made during optional extension periods would meet the definition of an asset (for the lessor) or a liability (for the lessee).
Others suggested that it would be extremely difficult in many cases to estimate variable lease payments if the amounts depended on future sales or use of the underlying asset and that such estimates would be subject to a high level of measurement uncertainty.
many respondents also were concerned about the breadth of the scope of the proposals, indicating that the proposed definition of a lease had the potential to capture some contracts that they considered to be for services.
The classification depended on the extent to which the lessee was expected to consume the economic benefits embedded in the underlying asset.
for lessees, simpler measurement requirements and a dual approach for the recognition and measurement of expenses related to a lease
for leases for which the lessee was expected to consume only an insignificant amount of the economic benefits embedded in the underlying asset, a lessee would recognise a single lease expense in the income statement.
This approach was based on the view that a single lease expense would provide better information about leases for which the lessee in essence is paying mainly for the use of the underlying asset and is expected to consume only an insignificant amount of the economic benefits embedded in the underlying asset itself.
for lessors, a dual approach for the recognition and measurement of lease assets
for leases for which the lessee was expected to consume more than an insignificant portion of the economic benefits embedded in the underlying asset, a lessor would recognise its residual interest in the underlying asset separately from its receivable from the lessee.

These meetings were held in Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, the UK and the US and included detailed discussions about the costs of implementation for those entities.
meetings with the IASB's advisory bodies — the Capital Markets Advisory Committee, the Global Preparers Forum, the IFRS Advisory Council and the Accounting Standards Advisory Forum.
These stakeholders included the majority of users of financial statements consulted, who were of the view that the proposed recognition of assets and liabilities by a lessee would provide them with a better starting point for their analyses.
nonetheless, many stakeholders had significant concerns about the proposed lessee accounting model.
Specific areas of the proposals that stakeholders highlighted as being particularly costly or complex included the dual lessee and lessor accounting models (both the lease classification proposals and the accounting requirements), the reassessment proposals, the disclosure proposals and the scope of the transactions subject to the proposals.
However, the Boards reached different decisions with respect to the expense recognition model.
For the reasons described in paragraphs BC41–BC56, the IASB decided to adopt a single lessee accounting model in which a lessee would account for all leases as providing finance.
In the light of all of the feedback received, the IASB is of the view that this model provides the most useful information to the broadest range of users of financial statements.
In contrast, the FASB decided to adopt a dual lessee expense recognition model, classifying leases in a similar manner to the previous US GAAP requirements for distinguishing between operating leases and capital leases.
In making these decisions, the Boards observed that, for lessees with a portfolio of leases starting and ending at different times, any difference in reported profit or loss between IFRS and US GAAP is not expected to be significant for many lessees.
In addition to the single lessee accounting model, which removes the need for lessees to classify leases, and the decision to substantially carry forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17, the IASB decided to
permit a lessee not to recognise assets and liabilities for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets;
confirm that an entity may apply the Standard at a portfolio level for leases with similar characteristics;
further simplify the measurement requirements for lease liabilities, in particular the requirements for variable lease payments, payments during optional periods and the reassessment of lease liabilities;
simplify the requirements for separating lease and non-lease components of a contract;
change the lessee disclosure requirements to enable lessees to more effectively focus disclosures on the most significant features of their lease portfolios; and
simplify the lessee transition requirements.
The approach to lease accounting
All contracts create rights and obligations for the parties to the contract.
As discussed further in paragraphs BC105–BC126, a lease is defined as a 'contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration'.
A lessee has the right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and an obligation to make payments to the lessor for providing the right to use that asset.
The lessee also has an obligation to return the underlying asset in a specified condition to the lessor at the end of the lease term.
The lessor has a right to receive payments from the lessee for providing the right to use the underlying asset.
The lessor also retains rights associated with ownership of the underlying asset.
Having identified the rights and obligations that arise from a lease, the IASB considered which of those rights and obligations create assets and liabilities for the lessee and lessor.
Right to use an underlying asset
The IASB concluded that a lessee's right to use an underlying asset meets the definition of an asset for the following reasons
Once the asset is made available for use by the lessee, the lessor is unable to retrieve or otherwise use the underlying asset for its own purposes during the lease term, despite being the legal owner of the underlying asset.
the lessee has the ability to determine how to use the underlying asset and, thus, how it generates future economic benefits from that right of use.
This ability demonstrates the lessee's control of the right of use.
Embedded in the right to use the truck is a particular volume of economic benefits or service potential that is used up over the period that the truck is driven by the lessee.
After the truck is made available for use by the lessee, the lessee can decide how it wishes to use up or consume the economic benefits embedded in its right of use within the parameters defined in the contract.
the right to control and use the asset exists even when a lessee's right to use an asset includes some restrictions on its use.
Although restrictions may affect the value and scope of a lessee's right to use an asset (and thus the payments made for the right of use), they do not affect the existence of the right-of-use asset.
It is not unusual for restrictions to be placed on the use of owned assets as well as leased assets.
Similarly, such restrictions do not prevent a lessee from controlling a right-of-use asset.
the lessee's control of the right of use arises from past events — not only the commitment to the lease contract but also the underlying asset being made available for use by the lessee for the duration of the non-cancellable period of the lease.
Some have noted that the lessee's right to use an asset is conditional on the lessee making payments during the lease term, ie that the lessee may forfeit its right to use the asset if it does not make payments.
However, unless the lessee breaches the contract, the lessee has an unconditional right to use the underlying asset.
Its position is similar to that of an entity that had made an instalment purchase and has not yet made the instalment payments.
That exposure draft proposes to define an asset as 'a present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events' and defines an economic resource as 'a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits'.
In the IASB's view, a lessee's right to use an underlying asset would meet this proposed definition of an asset, for the reasons described in paragraph BC22.
Consequently, the IASB concluded that the lessee's right to use an underlying asset meets both the existing and proposed definitions of an asset.
Obligation to make lease payments
The Conceptual Framework defines a liability as 'a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits'.
The IASB concluded that the lessee's obligation to make lease payments meets the definition of a liability for the following reasons
the lessee has a present obligation to make lease payments once the underlying asset has been made available to the lessee.
That obligation arises from past events — not only the commitment to the lease contract but also the underlying asset being made available for use by the lessee.
Unless the lessee renegotiates the lease, the lessee has no right to cancel the lease and avoid the contractual lease payments (or termination penalties) before the end of the lease term.
the obligation results in a future outflow of economic benefits from the lessee — typically contractual cash payments in accordance with the terms and conditions of the lease.
The IASB also considered the Conceptual Framework Exposure Draft, which proposes to define a liability as 'a present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events'.
In the IASB's view, a lessee's obligation to make lease payments would also meet this definition of a liability for the reasons described in paragraph BC25.
Consequently, the IASB concluded that a lessee's obligation to make lease payments meets both the existing and proposed definitions of a liability.
Obligation to return the underlying asset to the lessor
That obligation is a present obligation that arises from past events (the underlying asset being made available for use by the lessee under the terms of the lease contract).
Some are of the view that there is an outflow of economic benefits at the end of the lease term because the lessee must surrender the underlying asset, which will frequently still have some potential to generate economic benefits.
However, in the IASB's view, there is no outflow of economic benefits (other than incidental costs) from the lessee when it returns the leased item, because the lessee does not control the economic benefits associated with the asset that it returns to the lessor.
Once it reaches the end of the lease term, the position of the lessee is like that of an asset custodian.
Consequently, the IASB concluded that the lessee's obligation to return the underlying asset does not meet the definition of a liability in the Conceptual Framework.
The IASB is of the view that the changes proposed to the definition of a liability in the Conceptual Framework Exposure Draft would not affect this conclusion.
Having considered whether the lessee's right to use an underlying asset, obligation to make lease payments and obligation to return the underlying asset meet the definition of an asset or a liability, the IASB considered the lessee accounting model.
This is discussed in paragraphs BC41–BC56.
Why leases are different from service contracts for the lessee
The IASB concluded that leases create rights and obligations that are different from those that arise from service contracts.
When the lessor makes the underlying asset available for use by the lessee, the lessor has fulfilled its obligation to transfer the right to use that asset to the lessee — the lessee now controls that right of use.
Consequently, the lessee has an unconditional obligation to pay for that right of use.
In contrast, in a typical service contract, the customer does not obtain an asset that it controls at commencement of the contract.
Instead, the customer obtains the service only at the time that the service is performed.
Consequently, the customer typically has an unconditional obligation to pay only for the services provided to date.
In addition, although fulfilment of a service contract will often require the use of assets, fulfilment typically does not require making those assets available for use by the customer throughout the contractual term.
When the lessor makes the underlying asset available for use by the lessee, the lessor has fulfilled its obligation to transfer the right to use that asset to the lessee — the lessee controls the right of use.
The right arises from past events (not only the commitment to the lease contract but also the underlying asset being made available for use by the lessee) and is expected to result in future economic benefits (typically cash from the lessee) flowing to the lessor.
Consequently, the IASB concluded that the lessor's lease receivable meets the definition of an asset in the Conceptual Framework.
The IASB is of the view that the changes proposed to the definition of an asset in the Conceptual Framework Exposure Draft would not affect this conclusion.
Rights retained in the underlying asset
Although the lessor transfers the right to use the underlying asset to the lessee at the commencement date, the lessor has the right to the underlying asset at the end of the lease term (and retains some rights to the underlying asset during the lease term; for example, the lessor retains title to the asset).
Consequently, the lessor retains some of the potential economic benefits embedded in the underlying asset.
The lessor controls the rights that it retains in the underlying asset.
A lessor can often, for example, sell the underlying asset (with the lease attached) or agree at any time during the initial lease term to sell or re-lease the underlying asset at the end of the lease term.
Future economic benefits from the lessor's retained rights in the underlying asset are expected to flow to the lessor, assuming that the lease is for anything other than the full economic life of the underlying asset.
The lessor would expect to obtain economic benefits either from the sale, re-lease or use of the underlying asset at the end of the lease term.
Consequently, the IASB concluded that the lessor's rights retained in the underlying asset meet the definition of an asset in the Conceptual Framework.
Having considered whether the lessor's lease receivable and rights retained in the underlying asset meet the definition of an asset, the IASB considered the lessor accounting model.
This is discussed in paragraphs BC57–BC66.
Having concluded that the lessee's right to use the underlying asset meets the definition of an asset and the lessee's obligation to make lease payments meets the definition of a liability (as described in paragraphs BC22–BC40), the IASB then considered whether requiring a lessee to recognise that asset and liability for all leases would improve financial reporting to the extent that the benefits from the improvements would outweigh the costs associated with such a change.
In the light of these comments, the IASB concluded that there would be significant benefits from requiring a lessee to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases (except short-term leases and leases of low-value assets as described in paragraphs BC87–BC104), particularly for users of financial statements and others who have raised concerns about the extent of off balance sheet financing provided through operating leases.
The IASB considered the costs associated with requiring a lessee to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases throughout its redeliberations.
The costs and benefits of the lessee accounting model are discussed extensively in the Effects Analysis.
The IASB also consulted extensively on the approach to the recognition of lease expenses.
The feedback from that consultation emphasised that different stakeholders have different views about the economics of lease transactions.
In the light of this feedback, the IASB decided to expose for comment an alternative lessee expense recognition model — a dual model — that was responsive to those stakeholders who thought that a dual model would provide more useful information than a single model.
Although some stakeholders supported that model, the feedback received in response to the proposals reiterated the mixed views that had been received throughout the project regarding lessee accounting.
some stakeholders, including most users of financial statements, were of the view that all leases provide finance to lessees and, thus, create assets and 'debt-like' liabilities.
Consequently, they supported a single lessee expense recognition model according to which a lessee would recognise interest on those debt-like liabilities separately from depreciation of lease assets for all leases.
some were of the view that a lessee receives equal benefits from use of the underlying asset in each period and pays equal amounts for that benefit.
Consequently, they supported a single lessee expense recognition model in which a lessee would allocate the total cost of the lease to each period on a straight-line basis to reflect the pattern in which the lessee consumes benefits from use of the underlying asset.
These stakeholders also noted that a decision to lease assets rather than purchase them is sometimes made in order to obtain operational flexibility (rather than to obtain finance).
Consequently, they were of the view that a single straight-line lease expense would be a more faithful representation of the transaction in the income statement.
some supported a single lessee expense recognition model because they had concerns about the cost and complexity of a dual expense recognition model.
some supported a single lessee expense recognition model for conceptual reasons.
They thought that, if all leases are recognised on a lessee's balance sheet, any attempt to differentiate between those leases in the income statement would be arbitrary and result in inconsistencies with the accounting for a non-financial asset and a financial liability in the balance sheet.
some stakeholders noted that any dual model perpetuates the risk of structuring to gain a particular accounting outcome.
some stakeholders thought that there are real economic differences between different leases, particularly between property leases and leases of assets other than property.
These stakeholders recommended a dual lessee expense recognition model in which a lessee would recognise a single, straight-line lease expense for most property leases.
They recommended such a model because they view property lease expenses as an important part of operating expenses, particularly for entities such as retailers, hoteliers and restaurateurs.
They thought that recognition of a single, straight-line lease expense for all leases previously classified as operating leases would appropriately reflect the benefit that the lessee receives evenly over the lease term.
This accounting would also align the lease expense more closely with lease payments, which some stakeholders viewed as preferable.
The IASB also consulted many users of financial statements (see paragraphs BC9 and BC13).
Most users consulted (including almost all of those who analyse industrial, airline, transport and telecommunications sectors) were of the view that leases create assets and 'debt-like' liabilities.
Consequently, they thought that recognising interest on lease liabilities separately from depreciation of right-of-use assets would be beneficial to their analyses, particularly in assessing the operating performance of an entity.
The separate recognition of those expenses would be particularly beneficial for those users of financial statements who use reported information for their analyses without making further adjustments — it would create greater comparability in the income statement between entities that borrow to buy assets and those that lease similar assets.
Separating interest and depreciation would also provide coherency between the lessee's balance sheet and income statement (ie the interest expense would correspond to the lease liabilities presented as financial liabilities, and depreciation would correspond to the right-of-use assets presented as non-financial assets).
This coherency is important for some analyses, such as calculating return on capital employed and some leverage ratios.
Credit analysts consulted were generally of the view that all leases create assets and 'debt-like' liabilities for lessees.
Consequently, they saw benefit in recognising interest on lease liabilities separately from depreciation of right-of-use assets.
Most users of the financial statements of retailers, hoteliers and restaurateurs (ie those entities that typically have significant amounts of leased property) expressed support for a model that would recognise a single lease expense for property leases.
Some of those users view leases of property as executory contracts.
For them, a single lease expense recognised within operating expenses would have best satisfied their needs.
However, other users of the financial statements of retailers, hoteliers and restaurateurs had estimated an allocation of operating lease expense between depreciation and interest in their analyses based on previous lessee accounting requirements.
Consequently, those users thought that requiring a lessee to recognise interest on lease liabilities separately from depreciation of right-of-use assets would provide them with information that is useful for their analyses.
The IASB also considered the adjustments made by those lessees that, in applying the previous lessee accounting requirements, reported lease-adjusted 'non-GAAP' information alongside their financial statements.
These lessees often reported ratios based on amounts in the balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows that were adjusted to reflect the amounts that would have been reported if operating leases were accounted for as financing transactions (as is required by IFRS 16).
For example, a commonly reported amount was lease-adjusted return on capital employed which was often calculated as (a) operating profit adjusted for the estimated interest on operating leases; divided by (b) reported equity plus financial liabilities adjusted to include liabilities for operating leases.
In particular, any such model
would require either the right-of-use asset or the lease liability to be measured as a balancing figure.
This is because measuring (i) the right-of-use asset on the basis of cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment; and (ii) the lease liability using an effective interest method would generally not result in a straight-line lease expense.
Consequently, the IASB concluded that
most users of financial statements consulted think that leases create assets and 'debt-like' liabilities for a lessee.
Consequently, they benefit from lessees recognising interest on those liabilities in a similar way to interest on other financial liabilities, because that enables them to perform meaningful ratio analyses.
The same is true regarding the recognition of depreciation of right-of-use assets in a similar way to depreciation of other non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment.
The model is particularly beneficial for those users that rely on reported information without making adjustments.
the model is easy to understand — a lessee recognises assets and financial liabilities, and corresponding amounts of depreciation and interest.
(iii) the model addresses the concern of some users of financial statements that a dual model would perpetuate the risk of structuring to create a particular accounting outcome.
accounting for all leases recognised in the balance sheet in the same way appropriately reflects the fact that all leases result in a lessee obtaining the right to use an asset, regardless of the nature or remaining life of the underlying asset.
Consequently, the IASB decided to require a single lessee accounting model for all leases recognised in a lessee's balance sheet.
This model requires a lessee to depreciate the right-of-use asset similarly to other non-financial assets and to account for the lease liability similarly to other financial liabilities.
Other approaches considered for the lessee accounting model
The IASB also considered an approach similar to the lessee accounting requirements that have been decided upon by the FASB.
Most lessees that predominantly lease property supported such an approach, as did some users of financial statements that analyse entities that predominantly lease property.
In the view of those lessees and users, recognising lease expenses for property leases on a straight-line basis reflects the nature of the transaction.
In their view, a lessee should recognise these rentals on a straight-line basis.
The IASB did not adopt the approach decided upon by the FASB because, in its view
For both approaches, the most significant cost associated with a new lessee accounting model would be the cost associated with recognising and measuring right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases.
Having concluded that the lessor's lease receivable and rights retained in the underlying asset both meet the definition of an asset (as described in paragraphs BC35–BC40), the IASB considered whether requiring a lessor to recognise those assets for all leases would improve financial reporting to the extent that the benefits from the improvements would outweigh the costs associated with such a change.
Consequently, when the IASB initially added the Leases project to its agenda, the project was intended to address only lessee accounting and not lessor accounting.
The IASB had earlier proposed to address lessor accounting in response to feedback received from some respondents to the Discussion Paper (as described in paragraph BC6).
Those respondents had asked the IASB to address both lessee and lessor accounting at the same time because they thought that developing consistent and symmetrical accounting for lessees and lessors would be beneficial.
In particular, stakeholders observed that
In addition, investors generally analyse the financial statements of individual entities (and not a lessee and lessor of the same underlying asset).
Accordingly, it is not essential that the lessee and lessor accounting models are symmetrical.
Some stakeholders also acknowledged that their views on lessor accounting had changed over the life of the Leases project.
These stakeholders noted that they had originally suggested that the IASB should address lessor accounting at the same time as lessee accounting.
These stakeholders had changed their views primarily for cost-benefit reasons.
In the light of this feedback, the IASB concluded that requiring a lessor to recognise a lease receivable for all leases would not improve financial reporting to the extent that the benefits from the improvements would outweigh the costs associated with such a change.
In particular, the IASB made changes to the accounting for subleases, the definition of a lease, initial direct costs and lessor disclosures.
This is because the operator in a service concession arrangement does not have the right to control the use of the underlying asset.
Many stakeholders agreed with this approach.
The IASB made this decision because
for leases that have already commenced, no requirements are necessary.
The IASB decided that an entity should account for leases of right-of-use assets (ie subleases) in the same way as other leases.
The IASB noted that few of these transactions, if any, would meet the definition of a lease because a lessee is unlikely to be able to hold an asset that it leases (and that is owned by another party) for sale in the ordinary course of business, or for consumption in the process of production for sale in the ordinary course of business.
Accordingly, the IASB decided that a scope exclusion was not necessary.
Information about assets that are not essential to the operations of an entity is sometimes of less interest to users of financial statements, because those assets are often less significant to the entity.
Accordingly, some think that the costs associated with recognising and measuring the assets and liabilities arising from leases of non-core assets could outweigh the benefits to users.
For example, information about assets and liabilities arising from leases of delivery vans is important to assess the operations of a delivery company, but it may not be important for materiality reasons in assessing the operations of a bank that uses vans to deliver supplies to its retail banking locations.
Although some Board members favoured such an approach, the IASB noted that
defining 'core' and 'non-core' would be extremely difficult.
For example, would office buildings used by a bank be a core asset, and would the conclusion be different if the bank has retail banking operations?
Would an entity consider some offices or cars to be core assets and others non-core?
If core assets were defined as those essential to the operations of an entity, it could be argued that every lease would be a lease of a core asset.
Otherwise, why would an entity enter into the lease?
different entities might interpret the meaning of non-core assets differently, thereby reducing comparability for users of financial statements.
other Standards do not distinguish between core and non-core purchased assets.
Because of this, it would be difficult to justify distinguishing a right-of-use asset relating to a core asset from one that relates to a non-core asset.
A long-term lease of land is sometimes regarded as being economically similar to the purchase of the land.
there is no conceptual basis for differentiating long-term leases of land from other leases.
If the contract does not transfer control of the land to the lessee, but gives the lessee the right to control the use of the land throughout the lease term, the contract is a lease and should be accounted for as such.
In this case, the accounting applied by the lessee will be similar to accounting for the purchase of the land.
The IASB also noted that the IFRS Interpretations Committee had received questions about distinguishing between a lease and a sale or purchase when legal title to the underlying asset is not transferred.
This is discussed in paragraphs BC138–BC140.
Accordingly, if derivatives embedded in leases were not accounted for separately, unrelated derivative contracts could be bundled with leases to avoid measuring the derivatives at fair value.
This approach may be particularly useful for lessees with a large number of similar leases.
The IASB observed that the concept of materiality applies to leases, however, other Standards do not provide materiality guidance about particular transactions and events.
Similarly, if a lessee's leasing activities are material to its financial statements, but the effect of measuring lease liabilities on a discounted basis is not material, the lessee would not be required to measure its lease liabilities on a discounted basis and could instead, for example, measure them on an undiscounted basis.
In considering how to reduce the costs for lessees, the IASB considered both the nature and the scope of a possible exemption.
The IASB considered simplifying the measurement requirements for short-term leases.
Specifically, it considered exempting lessees from the requirement to discount the payments used to measure the assets and liabilities arising from short-term leases.
Many stakeholders, however, thought that this exemption would provide insufficient cost relief for lessees because it would still require an entity to track a possibly large volume of leases of a low value.
The IASB concluded that, even with simplified measurement requirements, the benefits of requiring a lessee to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases would not outweigh the associated costs.
The IASB decided that this choice should be made by class of underlying asset.
In the light of the feedback that an exemption for short-term leases did not provide sufficient relief for leases of low-value assets, the IASB also developed a separate exemption for those leases (see paragraphs BC98–BC104).
However, many stakeholders thought that a short-term lease exemption defined in this way would provide limited cost relief for lessees.
Instead, the IASB decided to expand the short-term lease exemption by making the determination of duration of short-term leases consistent with the determination of lease term, thus considering the likelihood of extension options being exercised or termination options not being exercised (see paragraphs BC152–BC159).
In reaching this decision, the IASB considered the risk that leases could be structured to meet the short-term lease exemption.
The IASB concluded that this risk is mitigated by the economic consequences of a short-term lease for a lessor.
There would often be an economic disincentive for lessors to grant shorter term leases, because shortening the lease term would increase the risk associated with a lessor's residual interest in the underlying asset.
Consequently, the IASB is of the view that a lessor would often either demand increased lease payments from the lessee to compensate for this change in risk or refuse to shorten the non-cancellable period of the lease.
This should reduce the risk of non-substantive break clauses being inserted within contracts solely for accounting purposes.
The IASB also decided that a lessee should reassess the lease term of a short-term lease by treating it as a new lease if that lease term changes.
That is because a lessee would include only lease payments for the duration of the lease term as an asset and a liability, irrespective of the maximum possible term.
However, on the basis of feedback received, the IASB concluded that any additional complexity in determining the lease term would be more than compensated for by the additional cost relief provided overall as a result of
applying the exemption to a wider group of leases; and
In the IASB's view, this disclosure provides useful information to users of financial statements about the lease payments that are excluded from lease liabilities as a consequence of the short-term lease exemption.
They suggested that such an exercise would require a significant amount of effort with potentially little effect on reported information.
In the light of these concerns, the IASB decided to provide a recognition exemption for leases of low-value assets.
The IASB intended the exemption to apply to leases for which the underlying asset, when new, is of low value (such as leases of tablet and personal computers, small items of office furniture and telephones).
A lease will not qualify for the exemption if the nature of the underlying asset is such that, when new, its value is typically not low.
The IASB also decided that the outcome of the assessment of whether an underlying asset is of low value should not be affected by the size, nature, or circumstances of the lessee — ie the exemption is based on the value, when new, of the asset being leased; it is not based on the size or nature of the entity that leases the asset.
The IASB conducted fieldwork to assess the effect that low-value asset leases would have if the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognised in the financial statements of lessees.
On the basis of this fieldwork, the IASB observed that, in most cases, assets and liabilities arising from leases within the scope of the exemption would not be material, even in aggregate.
However, in the light of feedback received from preparers of financial statements, the IASB concluded that the exemption would provide substantial cost relief to many lessees (and, in particular, smaller entities) by removing the burden of justifying that such leases would not be material in the aggregate.
The IASB acknowledged the risk that the aggregate value of leases captured by the exemption might be material in some cases.
The IASB's fieldwork suggested that the aggregate value is most likely to be material for large assets made up of a number of individual leases of low-value assets (such as IT equipment made up of individually low-value component parts).
Consequently, the IASB decided that if an underlying asset is highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with, other underlying assets, a lessee should not apply the recognition exemption to the lease of that individual asset.
Similarly, the IASB decided that a lessee should not apply the recognition exemption to a lease of an underlying asset if the lessee cannot benefit from that underlying asset on its own or together with other readily available resources, irrespective of the value of that underlying asset.
The IASB decided that the recognition exemption for leases of low-value assets should be applied on a lease-by-lease basis.
A requirement to apply the exemption by class of underlying asset, instead of lease-by-lease, would have introduced a burden on lessees to assess every individual asset within a class.
Consequently, in the IASB's view, the recognition exemption for leases of low-value assets will be easier to apply, and of more benefit to lessees, if applied on a lease-by-lease basis.
In the IASB's view, this disclosure provides useful information to users of financial statements about the amount of lease payments that are excluded from lease liabilities as a consequence of a lessee applying the exemption relating to leases of low-value assets.
If the customer controls the use of an identified asset for a period of time, then the contract contains a lease.
This will be the case if the customer can make the important decisions about the use of the asset in a similar way to that in which it makes decisions about owned assets that it uses.
Many respondents expressed concerns about the population of contracts that would be captured by the proposed requirements (and in particular that some contracts that they viewed as service contracts would be captured).
Respondents generally supported these changes.
However, many respondents stressed the increased importance of the definition of a lease, noting that the assessment of whether a contract contains a lease would generally determine whether a customer would recognise lease assets and lease liabilities.
Some of these respondents thought that the IASB had not provided adequate guidance to support consistent application of the proposed definition to more complicated scenarios.
The IASB is of the view that, in most cases, the assessment of whether a contract contains a lease should be straightforward.
A contract will either fail to meet the definition of a lease by failing to meet many of the requirements or will clearly meet the requirements to be a lease without requiring a significant amount of judgement.
However, application guidance has been added to make it easier for entities to make the lease assessment for more complicated scenarios.
It is important to know what the asset is in order to assess whether the customer has the right to control the use of that asset and, for example, to determine which asset finance lessors should derecognise.
Nonetheless, when assessing at the inception date whether there is an identified asset, an entity does not need to be able to identify the particular asset (for example, a specific serial number) that will be used to fulfil the contract to conclude that there is an identified asset.
Instead, the entity simply needs to know whether an identified asset is needed to fulfil the contract from commencement.
If that is the case, then an asset is implicitly specified.
If a supplier has a substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use, then there is no identified asset and the contract does not contain a lease.
The IASB has included application guidance to help determine the circumstances in which substitution rights are substantive.
This guidance focuses on whether the supplier has the practical ability to substitute the asset and would benefit economically from doing so.
The IASB's intention in including this guidance is to differentiate between
substitution rights that result in there being no identified asset because the supplier, rather than the customer, controls the use of an asset; and
substitution rights that do not change the substance or character of the contract because it is not likely, or practically or economically feasible, for the supplier to exercise those rights.
If a substitution clause is not substantive because it does not change the substance of the contract, then that substitution clause should not affect an entity's assessment of whether a contract contains a lease.
The IASB thinks that, in many cases, it will be clear that the supplier would not benefit from the exercise of a substitution right because of the costs associated with substituting an asset.
Substitution rights may not be substantive for a number of reasons.
Some substitution rights are not substantive because the contract restricts when a supplier can substitute the asset.
For example, if a contract states that a supplier can substitute the asset only on a specified future date or after the occurrence of a specified event, that substitution right is not substantive because it does not give the supplier the practical ability to substitute the asset throughout the period of use.
Other substitution rights are not substantive even if the supplier contractually has the right to substitute the asset at any time.
For example, if a supplier substitutes an asset for purposes of repair and maintenance, or if a supplier would benefit from substitution only in circumstances that are not considered likely to arise, those substitution rights are not substantive, regardless of whether those circumstances are specified in the contract.
Stakeholders raised concerns that in some cases it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a customer to determine whether a supplier's substitution right is substantive.
Difficulties may arise because the customer often does not have information about the costs of substitution that would be incurred by the supplier.
It is intended that a customer should assess whether substitution rights are substantive if it is reasonably able to do so — if substitution rights are substantive, then the IASB thinks that this would be relatively clear from the facts and circumstances.
However, the requirement is also intended to clarify that a customer is not expected to exert undue effort in order to provide evidence that a substitution right is not substantive.
The customer is unlikely to have the right to control the use of its portion because decisions about the use of the asset are typically made at the larger asset level.
Widening the notion of an identified asset to possibly capture portions of a larger asset that are not physically distinct might have forced entities to consider whether they lease assets used to fulfil any contract for services, only to conclude that they do not.
Consequently, the IASB concluded that widening the definition to include capacity portions of a larger asset would increase complexity for little benefit.
The right to control the use of an identified asset
Without any such decision-making rights, the customer would have no more control over the use of the asset than any customer purchasing supplies or services.
If this were the case, the customer would not control the use of the asset.
Right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset
Accordingly, the IASB concluded that, when considering whether a contract contains a lease, a customer should not consider economic benefits relating to ownership of an asset (for example, tax benefits as a result of owning an asset).
However, a customer should consider benefits relating to the use of the asset (for example, renewable energy credits received from the use of an asset or by-products resulting from the use of an asset).
Right to direct the use of the identified asset
If the supplier has that right, the supplier directs the use of the asset and, thus, no lease exists.
In the IASB's view, the decisions about how and for what purpose an asset is used are more important in determining control of the use of an asset than other decisions to be made about use, including decisions about operating and maintaining the asset.
This is because decisions about how and for what purpose an asset is used determine how, and what, economic benefits are derived from use.
Decisions regarding operating an asset are generally about implementing the decisions about how and for what purpose an asset is used and are dependent upon (and subordinate to) those decisions.
For example, a supplier's operational decisions would have no effect on the economic benefits derived from use of an asset if the customer decides that the asset should not be used.
In addition, if the supplier makes decisions about operating or maintaining an underlying asset, it often does so to protect its interest in that asset.
The IASB observed that considering decisions about how and for what purpose an asset is used can be viewed as similar to considering the decisions made by a board of directors when assessing control of the entity.
Decisions made by a board of directors about the operating and financing activities of an entity are generally the decisions that matter in that control assessment, rather than the actions of individuals in implementing those decisions.
The IASB noted that, in some cases, decisions about how and for what purpose an asset is used are predetermined and cannot be made by either the customer or the supplier during the period of use.
This could happen if, for example, all decisions about how and for what purpose an asset is used are agreed between the customer and supplier in negotiating the contract and cannot be changed after the commencement date, or are, in effect, predetermined by the design of the asset.
The IASB noted that it would expect decisions about how and for what purpose an asset is used to be predetermined in relatively few cases.
The approach to determining whether a customer has the right to direct the use of an identified asset changes if the decisions about how and for what purpose an asset is used are predetermined.
In either of these cases the customer controls rights of use that extend beyond the rights of a customer in a typical supply or service contract (ie the customer has rights that extend beyond solely ordering and receiving output from the asset).
In these cases, the customer has the right to make (or has made in the case of design) decisions that affect the economic benefits to be derived from use of the asset throughout the period of use.
Although the IASB thinks that each of these cases represents a scenario in which the customer directs the use of an asset, it expects that, for most leases, the assessment of whether a customer directs the use of an asset will be based on identifying the party that decides how and for what purpose an asset is used.
In the IASB's view, if a customer specifies the output from an asset at or before the beginning of the period of use (for example, within the terms of the contract), and cannot change that specification during the period of use, it generally does not control the use of an asset.
In that case, it would have no more decision-making rights than any customer in a typical supply or service contract.
In the IASB's view, such protective rights define the scope of the rights obtained by a customer without preventing a customer from having the right to direct the use of that asset.
Accordingly, protective rights may affect the price paid for the lease (ie a lessee may pay less for the use of the asset if it is more restricted in its use of that asset).
However, protective rights generally would not affect the existence of the customer's right to direct the use of the asset.
Other approaches considered for the definition of a lease
In developing IFRS 16, the IASB considered alternatives suggested by stakeholders regarding the definition of a lease.
The main alternatives considered are described below
In other words, there would have to be a clearly identifiable financing component for a contract to contain a lease.
However, the IASB did not adopt this approach because
in the IASB's view, it is appropriate to focus on whether the customer has obtained control of a right-of-use asset to determine whether a contract contains a lease.
The right-of-use asset gives rise to a corresponding lease liability if payments are made over time, but exists even if there is no lease liability (for example, when lease payments are fully prepaid).
If an entity obtains the right to use an asset for a period of time, the contract contains a lease, regardless of the timing of payments for that right of use.
The focus on the asset obtained in a lease also distinguishes leases from other contracts, such as service or supply arrangements.
many of the suggested indicators of 'financing arrangements' focus on the form of the payments, and on those payments being similar to payments within a loan agreement.
The IASB was concerned that if it focused on the form of an arrangement, rather than its substance
(A) many existing leases, including many existing finance leases and property leases, would no longer meet the definition of a lease, even when it is clear that the customer has obtained a right of use at contract commencement.
Applying such an approach, the concept of 'distinct' could have been used to distinguish between contracts that contain distinct lease and service components (that an entity should unbundle and account for separately) and those that do not contain distinct lease and service components (and therefore would be accounted for entirely as a contract for services).
The IASB did not adopt this approach because
They were developed to identify the nature of an entity's promises in a contract with a customer to ensure the most appropriate allocation and recognition of revenue.
In contrast, the lease definition requirements aim to identify whether a customer has obtained the right to use an asset and, therefore, should recognise the assets and liabilities associated with that transaction.
The IASB thinks that control is a more appropriate basis on which to make this determination.
the IASB was concerned that a requirement to determine whether lease and service components were distinct would add unnecessary complexity to the guidance.
This is because such an approach was expected to result in little difference in outcomes and yet would have included an additional requirement that could have been complicated to interpret and apply within the context of leases.
The IASB decided not to add this criterion because
the additional criterion is not necessary to appropriately determine if a customer controls the use of an asset.
Such an approach is not used elsewhere in IFRS when assessing control of an asset, such as the purchase of an item of property, plant and equipment.
entities might reach different conclusions for contracts that contain the same rights of use, depending on differences in customers' resources or suppliers' business models.
It may also have had unintended consequences.
In addition, the IASB did not identify any existing scenarios for which the inclusion of such a criterion would have been expected to change the lease conclusion.
The IASB decided not to include this requirement.
Again, in the IASB's view, if a contract conveys to the customer the right to use an asset, the contract contains a lease.
The presence of services, no matter how substantial, does not change the rights of use that a lessee obtains.
The IASB was concerned that similar rights of use could be accounted for differently because services of a more significant value had been bundled together with some right-of-use assets and not with others.
Assessing whether a contract contains a lease when the customer is a joint arrangement
The joint arrangement might be a joint venture or a joint operation.
Accordingly, if the parties to the joint arrangement collectively have the right to control the use of an identified asset throughout the period of use through their joint control of the arrangement, the contract contains a lease.
In that scenario, it would be inappropriate to conclude that a contract does not contain a lease on the grounds that each of the parties to the joint arrangement either obtains only a portion of the economic benefits from use of the underlying asset or does not unilaterally direct the use of the underlying asset.
For the purposes of defining the scope of IFRS 16, the IASB decided that a contract would be considered to exist only when it creates rights and obligations that are enforceable.
Any non-cancellable period or notice period in a lease would meet the definition of a contract and, thus, would be included as part of the lease term.
If optional periods are not enforceable, for example, if the lessee cannot enforce the extension of the lease without the agreement of the lessor, the lessee does not have the right to use the asset beyond the non-cancellable period.
Consequently, by definition, there is no contract beyond the non-cancellable period (plus any notice period) if there are no enforceable rights and obligations existing between the lessee and lessor beyond that term.
In assessing the enforceability of a contract, an entity should consider whether the lessor can refuse to agree to a request from the lessee to extend the lease.
Accordingly, if the lessee has the right to extend or terminate the lease, there are enforceable rights and obligations beyond the initial non-cancellable period and the parties to the lease would be required to consider those optional periods in their assessment of the lease term.
In contrast, a lessor's right to terminate a lease is ignored when determining the lease term because, in that case, the lessee has an unconditional obligation to pay for the right to use the asset for the period of the lease, unless and until the lessor decides to terminate the lease.
The IASB considered whether applying enforceability to leases in this way might encourage entities to add a clause to a lease that does not have economic substance, for example, stating that the lease could be cancelled at any point, knowing that, in practice, it would not be cancelled.
However, the IASB is of the view that such clauses are unlikely to be added because there often is an economic disincentive for either the lessor or lessee to agree to their inclusion.
For example, if a lessor has priced a contract assuming that the lessee will not cancel the contract, including such a clause would put the lessor at risk of being exposed to higher residual asset risk than had been anticipated when pricing the contract, which would be an economic disincentive for the lessor.
Those higher rentals would be an economic disincentive for the lessee, if it does not intend to cancel the contract.
Combination of contracts (paragraph B2)
The IASB noted that, although it is usually appropriate to account for contracts individually, it is also necessary to assess the combined effect of contracts that are interdependent.
In such situations, accounting for the contracts independently of each other might not result in a faithful representation of the combined transaction.
The IASB noted that some view the concept of faithful representation in the Conceptual Framework as sufficient to identify the circumstances in which contracts should be combined.
However, in the IASB's view, it is beneficial to add more clarity as to when to combine contracts within the context of leases, particularly with respect to sale and leaseback transactions, short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
Some contracts contain both lease and non-lease (service) components.
For example, a contract for a car may combine a lease with maintenance services.
For example, a single contract may include leases of land, buildings and equipment.
Separating lease and non-lease components
The objective of the Leases project is to change the accounting for leases — not the accounting for services.
The accounting for services (or the service components of a contract) should not be affected, regardless of whether the contract is only for services or includes the purchase, or lease, of an asset as well as services.
a lessor to separate lease components and non-lease components of a contract.
On the basis of feedback received from lessors, the IASB concluded that a lessor should be able to separate payments made for lease and non-lease components.
This is because the lessor would need to have information about the value of each component, or a reasonable estimate of it, when pricing the contract.
a lessee to separate lease components and non-lease components of a contract, unless it applies a practical expedient whereby it is not required to separate a lease component from any associated non-lease components and can instead elect to treat these as a single lease component.
The IASB decided to permit this practical expedient for cost benefit reasons and in response to requests from preparers not to require separation in all scenarios.
In the IASB's view, the practical expedient will reduce cost and complexity for some lessees, while not creating significant issues of comparability.
This is because, in general, a lessee is not expected to adopt the practical expedient for contracts with significant service components because that would significantly increase the lessee's lease liabilities for those contracts.
The IASB expects that lessees are likely to adopt this practical expedient only when the non-lease components of a contract are relatively small.
This approach will ensure consistency for entities that are both a lessor and a seller of goods or services in the same contract.
The IASB acknowledged that the stand-alone price of lease and non-lease components might not be readily available and, consequently, decided to permit the use of estimates, maximising the use of observable information.
The IASB was not aware of any significant practical difficulties in applying those requirements.
The IFRS Interpretations Committee had received questions about whether particular contracts that do not transfer legal title of land should be considered to be a lease or a purchase of the land.
There was little support from stakeholders for including such requirements.
In addition, the IASB observed that
accounting for a transaction depends on the substance of that transaction and not its legal form.
Recognising assets and liabilities arising from a lease at the commencement date is consistent with the lessee accounting model, in which a lessee recognises an asset representing its right to use an underlying asset for the period of the lease and a liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
A lessee does not obtain and control its right to use the underlying asset until the commencement date.
Before that date, the lessor has not yet performed under the contract.
Although a lessee may have a right and an obligation to exchange lease payments for a right-of-use asset from the date of inception, the lessee is unlikely to have an obligation to make lease payments before the asset is made available for its use.
The IASB noted that an obligation to exchange payments for a right-of-use asset could be onerous if the terms of the exchange are unfavourable.
The IASB noted that its intentions with respect to initial measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were that the measurement would reflect the nature of the transaction and the terms and conditions of the lease.
That would require a lessee to look to the terms and conditions agreed to in the contract at the inception date (which could be before the commencement date).
However, if the inception date was considered to be the date of initial measurement, that could result in a lessee recognising a gain or loss relating to changes between the dates of inception and commencement when recognising lease assets and lease liabilities at the commencement date.
Therefore, the IASB decided to align the date of recognition with the date of initial measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
The IASB noted that this approach has the following benefits
it clarifies that a gain or loss should not arise on initial recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by a lessee.
it removes the need to add requirements (and thus potentially increase complexity) on how to account for changes to the terms and conditions of a lease, or assumptions used in measuring right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, between the inception date and the commencement date.
Any changes to a lease that occur after the inception date and before the commencement date are taken into account when initially measuring the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the commencement date.
it is more consistent with the measurement date for other transactions, such as the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.
The IASB decided to require a cost measurement basis for the right-of-use asset and lease liability, with cost measured by reference to the present value of the lease payments.
The IASB also concluded that using a cost measurement basis will be less costly for preparers than other approaches.
The IASB did not adopt an approach that would refer to other Standards because
the approach would have been inconsistent with the IASB's decision not to apply a components approach to lease accounting (see paragraph BC153).
For example, if a lessee were to account for all of the features of a lease applying other Standards, the requirements on financial instruments may have routinely required options in a lease to be accounted for separately.
the approach could have been complex to apply, particularly when a lease contains relatively common features such as extension options, variable lease payments and residual value guarantees.
The IASB decided that a lessee should measure the right-of-use asset at cost, defined as
the present value of the lease payments;
any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee (see paragraphs BC149–BC151); and
The IASB considered whether a lessee should initially measure the right-of-use asset at fair value, which may provide more relevant information about the economic benefits to be derived from use of the underlying asset.
Measuring right-of-use assets on a basis similar to that used to measure the underlying asset maintains the comparability of amounts reported for leased and owned assets, which contributes to the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements.
Furthermore, measuring the right-of-use asset at cost is less complex and less costly for entities than measuring that asset at fair value, because there often is not an active market for right-of-use assets.
The IASB thinks that, for many leases, a cost measurement basis will also provide a reasonable approximation of the fair value of the right-of-use asset at the commencement date.
Including initial direct costs in the measurement of the right-of-use asset is consistent with the treatment of costs associated with acquiring other non-financial assets (for example, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets).
The IASB decided that lessees and lessors should apply the same definition of initial direct costs.
The IASB considered whether initial direct costs incurred by lessees should be allocated between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the commencement date.
However, the IASB concluded that such an approach could be costly for entities to apply, with little incremental benefit for users of financial statements.
Leases often grant the lessee a right to extend a lease beyond the non-cancellable period, or to terminate a lease before the end of the lease period.
However, a lease with options would never be exactly the same as a lease without any options.
There are a number of different ways that an entity could reflect duration-related options that exist in leases
a components approach, in which options in a lease are recognised and measured as separate components of the lease.
The IASB did not adopt a components approach because it would have created a complex lease accounting model, would have been difficult to apply because options may be difficult to measure, and would have ignored the interrelationship between the term of a lease and the exercise of options.
a disclosure approach, in which an entity recognises a lease liability or a lease receivable for the non-cancellable period and discloses the existence of any options to extend the term.
Although simple to apply, the IASB did not adopt this approach because the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities would ignore the existence of options, including those that are virtually certain to be exercised.
Consequently, this approach would potentially misrepresent the assets and liabilities arising from a lease.
a measurement approach, in which options in a lease are included in the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities using a particular method.
That method could be, for example
a probability-weighted measurement method (in which the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities reflects the probability of each possible lease term);
a probability threshold method (in which an entity includes optional periods in the lease term if the exercise of the options meets a specified threshold, for example reasonably certain, virtually certain or more likely than not); or
Different views were expressed on whether optional periods should be included within an entity's determination of the lease term.
Some stakeholders were of the view that payments to be made during future optional periods do not meet the definition of a liability for the lessee (or an asset for the lessor) until those options are exercised.
This is because, before the exercise date, a lessee can avoid those payments by choosing to exercise a termination option or not to exercise an extension option.
These stakeholders suggested limiting the lease term to the contractually committed period, ie the non-cancellable period.
Conversely, many stakeholders thought that because options to extend or terminate leases affect the economics of those leases, there is a need to include some options when determining the lease term.
If a lessee expects to exercise an option to extend the lease term, some think that including that longer lease term in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability would provide a more faithful representation of the economics of the lease.
Inclusion of some renewal options is also needed to mitigate the risk of lessees inappropriately excluding lease liabilities from the balance sheet (for example, by excluding lease payments in optional periods for which the lessee has a clear economic incentive to exercise those options).
In the IASB's view, the lease term should reflect an entity's reasonable expectation of the period during which the underlying asset will be used because that approach provides the most useful information.
requiring an entity to determine the lease term as the longest possible term that is more likely than not to occur.
requiring an entity to include in the lease term optional periods for which the lessee has a significant economic incentive to exercise an option.
Under this approach, an expectation of exercise alone (and without any economic incentive to do so) would not be sufficient.
The IASB noted that requiring an economic incentive provides a threshold that is more objective than a threshold based solely on management's estimates or intention, and consequently would help to address concerns that other approaches would be complex to apply.
Accordingly, when initially determining the lease term, an entity should consider all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise that option.
to help entities identify the relevant factors, which are not confined to the contractual payments during the optional periods.
For example, within the context of property leases, the IASB noted the relevance of considering the costs of finding a new location at the end of the non-cancellable period and of relocating to that new location, or the importance of the location (for example, a head office or a flagship store) to the lessee.
to reduce the risk of non-substantive break clauses being inserted within contracts solely to reduce the lease term beyond what is economically reasonable for the lessee.
In such cases, a lessee considers how the arrangement is most faithfully represented in the financial statements.
For example, a lease contract might contain a set of options that results in
The set of payments that aggregate to the lowest amount (on a discounted basis) from the available realistic options is the minimum amount that the lessee is obliged to pay.
In the IASB's view, this minimum amount is an in-substance fixed payment that should be recognised as part of the cost of the right-of-use asset and as a liability by the lessee (see paragraph B42(c) of IFRS 16).
a choice for the lessee that represents a guarantee provided to the lessor under which the lessee guarantees the lessor a minimum or fixed cash return regardless of whether an option is exercised.
Such a situation might occur, for example, if an extension option is associated with a residual value guarantee or a termination penalty under which the lessor is guaranteed to receive an economic inflow at least equivalent to the payments that would be made by the lessee during the optional period.
Subsequent measurement of options to extend or terminate a lease is discussed in paragraphs BC184–BC187.
The IASB's objective in specifying the discount rate to apply to a lease is to specify a rate that reflects how the contract is priced.
With this in mind, the IASB decided that, if readily determinable by the lessee, a lessee should use the interest rate implicit in the lease.
The interest rate implicit in the lease is likely to be similar to the lessee's incremental borrowing rate in many cases.
This is because both rates, as they have been defined in IFRS 16, take into account the credit standing of the lessee, the length of the lease, the nature and quality of the collateral provided and the economic environment in which the transaction occurs.
However, the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally also affected by a lessor's estimate of the residual value of the underlying asset at the end of the lease, and may be affected by taxes and other factors known only to the lessor, such as any initial direct costs of the lessor.
Consequently, the IASB noted that it is likely to be difficult for lessees to determine the interest rate implicit in the lease for many leases, particularly those for which the underlying asset has a significant residual value at the end of the lease.
If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, then the lessee should use its incremental borrowing rate. In reaching this decision, the IASB decided to define the lessee's incremental borrowing rate to take into account the terms and conditions of the lease. The IASB noted that, depending on the nature of the underlying asset and the terms and conditions of the lease, a lessee may be able to refer to a rate that is readily observable as a starting point when determining its incremental borrowing rate for a lease (for example, the rate that a lessee has paid, or would pay, to borrow money to purchase the type of asset being leased, or the property yield when determining the discount rate to apply to property leases).
Variable lease payments (paragraph 27(a)–(b))
Some or all of the lease payments for the right to use an asset during the lease term can be variable.
Variable lease payments that are in-substance fixed lease payments
In-substance fixed lease payments are payments that may, in form, contain variability but that in substance are unavoidable.
Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate
For similar reasons, the IASB decided to include variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate in the measurement of lease liabilities.
Those payments meet the definition of liabilities for the lessee because they are unavoidable and do not depend on any future activity of the lessee.
Any uncertainty, therefore, relates to the measurement of the liability that arises from those payments and not to the existence of that liability.
In the IASB's view, forecasting techniques could be used to determine the expected effect of changes in an index or a rate on the measurement of lease liabilities.
However, forecasting changes in an index or a rate requires macroeconomic information that may not be readily available to all entities, and may result in measurement uncertainty.
The IASB noted that the usefulness of the enhanced information obtained using such a forecast often might not justify the costs of obtaining it, particularly for those lessees with a high volume of leases.
The IASB considered requiring a lessee to use forward rates when measuring lease liabilities if those rates are readily available.
However, it decided not to do so because this would reduce comparability between those using forward rates and those not doing so.
Subsequent measurement of variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate is discussed in paragraphs BC188–BC190.
Variable lease payments linked to future performance or use of an underlying asset
There are differing views about whether variable payments linked to future performance or use of an underlying asset meet the definition of a liability.
Some think that a lessee's liability to make variable lease payments does not exist until the future event requiring the payment occurs (for example, when the underlying asset is used, or a sale is made).
Others think that a lessee's obligation to make variable lease payments exists at the commencement date by virtue of the lease contract and receipt of the right-of-use asset.
Consequently, they think that all variable lease payments meet the definition of a liability for the lessee because it is the amount of the liability that is uncertain, rather than the existence of that liability.
The IASB decided to exclude variable lease payments linked to future performance or use of an underlying asset from the measurement of lease liabilities.
For some Board members, this decision was made solely for cost-benefit reasons.
Those Board members were of the view that all variable lease payments meet the definition of a liability for the lessee.
However, they were persuaded by the feedback received from stakeholders that the costs of including variable lease payments linked to future performance or use would outweigh the benefits, particularly because of the concerns expressed about the high level of measurement uncertainty that would result from including them and the high volume of leases held by some lessees.
Other Board members did not think that variable lease payments linked to future performance or use meet the definition of a liability for the lessee until the performance or use occurs.
They regarded those payments to be avoidable by the lessee and, accordingly, concluded that the lessee does not have a present obligation to make those payments at the commencement date.
In addition, variable lease payments linked to future performance or use could be viewed as a means by which the lessee and lessor can share future economic benefits to be derived from use of the asset.
Residual value guarantees (paragraph 27(c))
The IASB decided that a lessee should account for a residual value guarantee that it provides to the lessor as part of the lease liability (and as part of the cost of the right-of-use asset).
In reaching this decision, the IASB noted that payments resulting from a residual value guarantee cannot be avoided by the lessee — the lessee has an unconditional obligation to pay the lessor if the value of the underlying asset moves in a particular way.
Accordingly, any uncertainty relating to the payment of a residual value guarantee does not relate to whether the lessee has an obligation.
Instead, it relates to the amount that the lessee may have to pay, which can vary in response to movements in the value of the underlying asset.
In that respect, residual value guarantees are similar to variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate for the lessee.
Therefore, the IASB decided that a lessee should estimate the amount expected to be payable to the lessor under residual value guarantees and include that amount in the measurement of the lease liability.
In the IASB's view, the measurement of a residual value guarantee should reflect an entity's reasonable expectation of the amount that will be paid.
The IASB considered whether a lessee should recognise and measure residual value guarantees as separate components of a lease, because such guarantees are linked to the value of the underlying asset and may meet the definition of a derivative.
However, the IASB noted that residual value guarantees are often interlinked with other terms and conditions in a lease so that accounting for the guarantees as separate components could diminish the relevance and faithful representation of the information provided.
Recognising such guarantees separately could also be costly to apply.
Options to purchase the underlying asset (paragraph 27(d))
The IASB decided that purchase options should be included in the measurement of the lease liability in the same way as options to extend the term of a lease (ie the exercise price of a purchase option would be included in the measurement of a lease liability if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option).
This is because the IASB views a purchase option as effectively the ultimate option to extend the lease term.
A lessee that has an option to extend a lease for all of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset is, economically, in a similar position to a lessee that has an option to purchase the underlying asset.
Accordingly, the IASB concluded that, for the same reasons underlying the decision to include extension options, including the exercise price within the measurement of a lease liability if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option provides the most useful information to users of financial statements.
The Board concluded that little would be lost by deleting it.
The IASB decided that, after the commencement date, a lessee should measure the right-of-use asset at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, adjusted for remeasurements of the lease liability (see paragraph BC192).
Paragraphs BC41–BC56 include a detailed discussion of the feedback received on the lessee accounting model and the basis for the IASB's decisions regarding the subsequent measurement of a lessee's right-of-use asset.
inconsistent with the subsequent measurement of many other non-financial assets; and
more complex and costly for entities to apply than a cost-based approach, because it requires the use of both current expected cash flows and current interest rates.
In the IASB's view, this requirement enables users of financial statements to better compare assets that a lessee owns with those that it leases.
IFRS permits the revaluation of non-financial assets, such as property, plant and equipment.
Accordingly, the IASB saw no reason not to allow a lessee to revalue right-of-use assets, albeit only if the lessee revalues similar classes of owned assets.
IFRS also permits investment properties to be measured at fair value.
This is because measuring all investment property on the same basis provides more useful information than allowing an entity to choose the measurement basis for each property.
This results in lessees using either the cost model and disclosing fair value, or using the fair value model, depending on whether the lessee accounts for the remainder of its investment property under the cost model or the fair value model.
In the IASB's view, this approach will provide useful information to users of financial statements about the fair value of investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset, which is consistent with information provided about owned investment property.
Some stakeholders expressed concerns about the costs of determining the fair value of right-of-use assets (whether for disclosure or measurement purposes).
The IASB acknowledged that there might be costs involved with determining the fair value of right-of-use assets, particularly for entities that are not in the property industry but sublease property, for example, because that property is not needed for use within their business.
In the IASB's view it should be relatively straightforward to determine the fair value of right-of-use assets if the sublease does not contain any options or variable lease payments.
Determining the fair value would involve projecting the cash flows that the entity expects to receive from subleasing the asset.
The IASB concluded that, for an entity that is not in the property industry, determining these cash flows would normally be relatively straightforward because it is likely that a sublease would already be in place.
The IASB decided that a lessee should measure lease liabilities similarly to other financial liabilities using an effective interest method, so that the carrying amount of the lease liability is measured on an amortised cost basis and the interest expense is allocated over the lease term.
In the IASB's view, this approach would have been
inconsistent with the subsequent measurement of many other non-derivative financial liabilities, thus decreasing comparability for users of financial statements; and
In principle, the IASB is of the view that users of financial statements receive more relevant information if lessees reassess extension, termination and purchase options on a regular basis.
The resulting information is more relevant because reassessment reflects current economic conditions, and using a lease term established at the commencement date throughout the lease could be misleading.
However, requiring reassessment at each reporting date would be costly for an entity with many leases that include options.
It decided that an appropriate balance would be achieved by
requiring reassessment only upon the occurrence of a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that affects whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, or not to exercise, an option to extend a lease, to terminate a lease or to purchase an underlying asset.
Instead, an entity tests for impairment when there has been an indication that the asset may be impaired.
requiring reassessment only if the significant event or significant change in circumstances is within the control of the lessee.
Limiting the reassessment requirement in this way means that a lessee is not required to reassess options in response to purely market-based events or changes in circumstances.
The IASB noted that an entity will need to apply judgement in identifying significant events or significant changes in circumstances that trigger reassessment and that it would be impossible to provide a list of all possible triggering events.
Nonetheless, the IASB decided to provide some examples of possible triggering events to help entities apply that judgement.
The IASB considered but did not adopt the following approaches
requiring a lessee to reassess options when there has been a change in facts or circumstances that would indicate that there is a significant change in the right-of-use asset or lease liability.
Many stakeholders thought that it could be difficult to interpret when a change in the right-of-use asset or lease liability is significant.
In addition, stakeholders were concerned about both the costs of performing reassessment and, if relevant, the costs associated with demonstrating that reassessment was not required, which might be as costly as reassessing options at each reporting date.
Many stakeholders thought that the cost of applying this approach would exceed any benefit, because an entity might incur significant costs in continuously assessing and monitoring relevant factors that give rise to a significant economic incentive even though the lease term conclusion might not change.
Reassessment of variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate (paragraph 42(b))
In principle the IASB is of the view that users of financial statements receive more relevant information about a lessee's lease liabilities if the lessee updates the measurement of its liabilities to reflect a change in an index or a rate used to determine lease payments (including, for example, a change to reflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review).
Some stakeholders expressed concerns about the cost of performing reassessments each time a rate or an index changes, and questioned whether the benefits for users of financial statements would outweigh the costs for lessees.
For example, some stakeholders noted that the total expenses related to leases recognised in profit or loss by a lessee would be substantially the same, regardless of whether the lessee remeasures the lease liability for changes in an index or a rate.
In the light of this feedback, the IASB decided that a lessee should reassess variable lease payments that are determined by reference to an index or a rate only when there is a change in the cash flows resulting from a change in the reference index or rate (ie when the adjustment to the lease payments takes effect).
The IASB noted that this approach is less complex and costly to apply than requiring a lessee to reassess variable lease payments at each reporting date.
This is because a lessee would typically be expected to report its financial results more frequently than the occurrence of a contractual change in the cash flows of a lease with payments that depend on an index or a rate.
Reassessment of residual value guarantees (paragraph 42(a))
The IASB decided that lessees should reassess the amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees, because that provides more relevant information to users of financial statements, by reflecting current economic conditions.
The IASB decided that, if a lessee remeasures its lease liability to reflect changes in future lease payments, the lessee should recognise the amount of the remeasurement as an adjustment to the cost of the right-of-use asset.
The IASB considered whether some changes to the measurement of the lease liability should be recognised in profit or loss because, for example, the reassessment of an option or a change in an index or a rate could be viewed as an event relating to the current period.
However, the IASB decided that a lessee should recognise the remeasurement as an adjustment to the right-of-use assets for the following reasons
a change in the estimate of the future lease payments is a revision to the initial estimate of the cost of the right-of-use asset, which should be accounted for in the same manner as the initial estimated cost.
The IASB decided that, in most cases, an entity should not reassess the discount rate during the lease term.
This approach is generally consistent with the approach applied to financial instruments accounted for using the effective interest method.
The IASB noted that in other Standards in which the discount rate is required to be reassessed, it is typically because the liability to which the discount rate relates is measured on a current value measurement basis.
Nonetheless, in the IASB's view, there are some circumstances in which an entity should reassess the discount rate.
In the IASB's view, in those circumstances, the economics of the lease have changed and it is appropriate to reassess the discount rate to be consistent with the change in the lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability (and right-of-use asset).
The IASB also decided that, in a floating interest rate lease, a lessee should use a revised discount rate to remeasure the lease liability when there is a change in lease payments resulting from changes in the floating interest rate.
Some stakeholders suggested that a lessee should recognise any foreign currency exchange differences as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.
This approach would treat translation adjustments as an update to the cost of the right-of-use asset, which is initially measured on the basis of the initial measurement of the lease liability.
These stakeholders are of the view that lease payments denominated in a foreign currency are in effect another form of variable lease payment, and should be accounted for similarly to variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate.
These stakeholders also questioned whether useful information will be obscured as a result of the profit or loss volatility that might arise as a result of recognising foreign currency exchange differences on a lessee's lease liability in profit or loss.
The IASB decided that any foreign currency exchange differences relating to lease liabilities denominated in a foreign currency should be recognised in profit or loss, for the following reasons
if a lessee enters into derivatives to hedge its economic exposure to foreign currency risk, the recognition of foreign currency exchange differences relating to lease liabilities as an adjustment to the cost of right-of-use assets would prevent a natural offset of the economic exposure in profit or loss.
This is because an entity would recognise any change in the foreign currency risk for the derivatives in profit or loss, whereas it would recognise the corresponding change in lease liabilities in the balance sheet — thus introducing volatility as a result of reducing exposure to foreign currency risk.
This mismatch could distort the reported economic position of the lessee.
in the IASB's view, subsequent changes to a foreign exchange rate should not have any effect on the cost of a non-monetary item.
Consequently, it would be inappropriate to include such changes in the remeasurement of the right-of-use asset.
Although this approach could result in volatility in profit or loss from the recognition of foreign currency exchange differences, an entity would disclose those changes separately as foreign currency exchange gains or losses.
Accordingly, it would be clear to users of financial statements that the gain or loss results solely from movements in foreign exchange rates.
The IASB decided to define a lease modification as a change in the scope of a lease (for example, adding or terminating the right to use one or more underlying assets, or extending or shortening the contractual lease term), or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms and conditions of the lease.
In defining lease modifications, the IASB differentiated between scenarios resulting in the remeasurement of existing lease assets and lease liabilities that are not lease modifications (for example, a change in lease term resulting from the exercise of an option to extend the lease when that option was not included in the original lease term) and those resulting in a lease modification (for example, a change in the lease term resulting from changes to the terms and conditions of the original lease).
The IASB decided that an entity should further distinguish between those lease modifications that, in substance, represent the creation of a new lease that is separate from the original lease and those that, in substance, represent a change in the scope of, or the consideration paid for, the existing lease.
For those lease modifications that do not result in a separate lease, the IASB decided that a lessee should remeasure the existing lease liability using a discount rate determined at the effective date of the modification.
for lease modifications that decrease the scope of a lease, a lessee should decrease the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease and recognise a corresponding gain or loss.
In the IASB's view, this gain or loss appropriately reflects the economic effect of the partial or full termination of the existing lease resulting from the decrease in scope.
for all other lease modifications, a lessee should make a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.
In these cases, the original lease is not terminated because there is no decrease in scope.
The lessee continues to have the right to use the underlying asset identified in the original lease.
For lease modifications that increase the scope of a lease, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset effectively represents the cost of the additional right of use acquired as a result of the modification.
For lease modifications that change the consideration paid for a lease, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset effectively represents a change in the cost of the right-of-use asset as a result of the modification.
The use of a revised discount rate in remeasuring the lease liability reflects that, in modifying the lease, there is a change in the interest rate implicit in the lease (which the discount rate is intended to approximate).
The IASB concluded that this approach results in accounting outcomes that faithfully represent the substance of a lease modification and will closely align gain or loss recognition with a corresponding change in the lessee's rights and obligations under the lease.
However, the IASB did not adopt this approach because, as a result of the link to the right-of-use asset, it could result in outcomes that would not faithfully represent the differing nature of each of those changes.
For example, there are scenarios in which this approach would result in the extinguishment of the original lease (and the recognition of a corresponding gain or loss in profit or loss) when the lessee continues to have all of the rights it had in the original lease after the modification.
The Board provided the practical expedient in response to information about the effects of the covid-19 pandemic.
The Board learned that lessees could find it challenging to assess whether a potentially large volume of covid-19-related rent concessions are lease modifications and, for those that are, to apply the required accounting in IFRS 16, especially in the light of the many challenges lessees face during the pandemic.
The Board concluded that the practical expedient would provide relief to lessees, while enabling lessees to continue providing useful information about their leases to users of financial statements (see paragraph BC205F).
The Board decided to permit, but not require, a lessee to apply the practical expedient.
The Board considered the risk of the practical expedient being applied too broadly, which could result in unintended consequences.
result in revised consideration for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change.
The Board was of the view that a rent concession that increases total payments for the lease should not be considered a direct consequence of the covid-19 pandemic, except to the extent the increase reflects only the time value of money.
introduce no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease, considering both qualitative and quantitative factors.
The lessee would also make a corresponding adjustment to the lease liability—in effect, derecognising the part of the lease liability that has been forgiven or waived.
The Board was of the view that the information provided by a lessee that applies the practical expedient would be useful to users of financial statements, noting that the lease liability recognised would reflect the present value of future lease payments owed to the lessor.
Consequently, the Board decided to require a lessee applying the practical expedient to some or all eligible contracts to disclose that fact, as well as the amount recognised in profit or loss to reflect changes in lease payments that arise from rent concessions to which the practical expedient is applied (paragraph 60A of IFRS 16).
Users of financial statements also highlighted the importance of cash flow information about covid-19-related rent concessions.
The main effect on cash flows would be the reduction or absence of cash outflows for leases during the period of the rent concession.
The Board noted that cash flow effects, and other information about, for example, the nature of rent concessions, would be relevant regardless of whether a lessee applies the practical expedient.
The IASB decided that, if not presented separately in the balance sheet, right-of-use assets should be included within the same line item as similar owned assets.
The IASB concluded that, if right-of-use assets are not presented as a line item, presenting similar leased and owned assets together would provide more useful information to users of financial statements than other approaches.
This is because a lessee often uses owned assets and leased assets for the same purpose and derives similar economic benefits from the use of owned assets and leased assets.
However, the IASB noted that there are differences between a right-of-use asset and an owned asset, and that users of financial statements may want to know the carrying amount of each separately.
For example, right-of-use assets may be viewed as being (a) less risky than owned assets, because a right-of-use asset may not embed residual asset risk; or (b) more risky than owned assets, because the lessee may need to replace the right-of-use asset at the end of the lease term, but may not be able to secure a similar rate for the replacement lease.
Similarly, the IASB decided that a lessee should present lease liabilities separately from other liabilities, either in the balance sheet or in the notes.
In reaching this decision, the IASB noted that leasing is an important activity for many lessees.
Although a lease liability shares many common characteristics with other financial liabilities, a lease liability is contractually related to a corresponding asset and often has features, such as options and variable lease payments, that differ from those typically found in other liabilities.
Thus, presenting lease liabilities separately from other financial liabilities (along with the disclosure requirements discussed in paragraphs BC212–BC230) provides users of financial statements with information that is useful in understanding an entity's obligations arising from lease arrangements.
Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (paragraph 49)
The IASB decided that a lessee should present interest expense on the lease liability separately from the depreciation charge for the right-of-use asset in the income statement.
The IASB concluded that a lessee would provide more useful information to users of financial statements by presenting interest on the lease liability together with interest on other financial liabilities and depreciation of the right-of-use asset together with other similar expenses (for example, depreciation of property, plant and equipment).
Paragraphs BC41–BC56 include a discussion of the basis for the IASB's decisions relating to amounts recognised in profit or loss by a lessee.
The IASB's decisions on the presentation of lease cash outflows are linked to the nature of the right-of-use asset and lease liability, and the presentation of expenses arising from a lease in the income statement.
Consequently, the IASB decided that a lessee should classify the principal portion of cash repayments of the lease liability as financing activities in the statement of cash flows and classify cash payments relating to interest consistently with other interest payments.
This approach also results in a lessee accounting for a lease consistently in the balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows.
In determining the disclosures for leases, the IASB considered the following
the disclosure requirements for non-current assets such as property, plant and equipment;
work on other related projects such as the Disclosure Initiative (a broad-based initiative to explore how disclosures in IFRS financial reporting can be improved); and
The IASB received significant feedback regarding lessee disclosures.
This was a particular concern for lessees with a high volume of leases with unique terms and conditions.
These lessees also argued that the proposed lessee disclosure requirements did not seem to be consistent with the IASB's efforts to address 'disclosure overload' in other projects (ie increases in the volume of disclosures and a perceived reduction in the quality and usefulness of those disclosures).
Over the course of the project, the IASB held meetings with investors and analysts to discuss how particular disclosures would be used in their analysis and which disclosures would be the most useful.
both preparers and users of financial statements had concerns that lengthy detailed disclosure requirements could lead to the use of 'boilerplate' statements rather than the provision of useful information.
These stakeholders were particularly concerned about the risk of material information being 'lost' within lengthy and complex financial statement notes.
some users of financial statements noted that the most useful information would be different for different lease portfolios.
These users noted that, for leases with complex terms and conditions (which, for some entities, are the leases in which users are most interested), compliance with standardised disclosure requirements often does not meet their information needs.
In response to this feedback, the IASB decided to
require a lessee to disclose quantitative information about its right-of-use assets, and expenses and cash flows related to leases (paragraphs BC217–BC223); and
require a lessee to disclose any additional information that is necessary to satisfy the overall disclosure objective, and to supplement this requirement with a list of user information needs that any additional disclosures should address (paragraphs BC224–BC227).
Overall disclosure objective (paragraph 51)
In the IASB's view, a clear objective should improve the interpretation and implementation of the disclosure requirements.
This is because a lessee is required to assess whether the overall quality and informational value of its lease disclosures are sufficient to meet the stated objective.
The IASB considered stakeholder suggestions that an explicit statement about materiality would be useful in applying the lessee disclosure requirements.
However, such statements are not included in other Standards.
The IASB is of the view that implicit in the overall disclosure objective is the notion that the level of detail provided in disclosures should reflect the significance of a lessee's leasing activities to its financial statements.
Disclosures about right-of-use assets, and expenses and cash flows related to leases (paragraph 53)
The IASB decided that there are particular items of information that, if material, should be disclosed by lessees to meet the information needs of users of financial statements.
These disclosure requirements relate to the information that users of financial statements have identified as being most useful to their analyses and, consequently, that they would like to have for all lease portfolios that are material to an entity.
These disclosures provide information about lease payments for which assets and liabilities are not recognised in the balance sheet.
income from subleasing right-of-use assets.
This disclosure is useful because, along with the information about expenses related to leases discussed above, it provides a complete depiction of the overall income statement effect of an entity's leasing activities.
Users of financial statements identified the main objective of a maturity analysis as being to help them understand liquidity risk and estimate future cash flows.
In particular, the prescriptive nature of the requirement ensured that different lessees provided information that was comparable.
In addition, the IASB is of the view that it is appropriate to apply the same maturity analysis disclosure requirements to lease liabilities as those applied to other financial liabilities.
The IASB decided not to require the disclosure of a maturity analysis of non-lease components.
The IASB thinks that users of financial statements would find information about the maturities of any contractual commitments of an entity useful, regardless of the nature of the entity's rights under the contract.
However, the IASB noted that it could be misleading to require the disclosure of contractual commitments for services that are embedded within a lease without also requiring the disclosure of contractual commitments for services that are provided as part of other contracts.
The IASB decided that adding such a disclosure requirement would be beyond the scope of the Leases project.
Many leases contain more complex features, which can include variable payments, termination and extension options and residual value guarantees.
These features of a lease are often determined on the basis of the individual circumstances of the parties to the contract and, in some cases, are particularly complex or are unique to the particular contract.
The feedback received from stakeholders demonstrated that, for these features of a lessee's lease portfolio, a standard disclosure requirement for all entities is unlikely to meet the needs of users of financial statements.
In the IASB's view, this approach facilitates the provision of more relevant and useful disclosures by (a) discouraging the use of generic or 'boilerplate' statements; and (b) enabling a lessee to apply judgement to identify the information that is relevant to users of financial statements and focus its efforts on providing that information.
However, the IASB thinks that
In the IASB's view, it is appropriate that greater cost will be required in preparing lease disclosures for entities whose leasing activity is particularly complex or unique.
The IASB considered requiring disclosure of specific information about these more complex features.
Such information could have included, for example, the basis and terms and conditions on which variable lease payments and options are determined.
However, lessees informed the IASB that this information would be difficult to capture in a meaningful way, particularly for large or diverse lease portfolios.
Some users of financial statements also expressed concerns that such an approach could lead to 'boilerplate' compliance statements, which generally do not provide useful information.
The approach taken enables lessees to determine the best way to provide information while considering both the costs of providing that information and the information needs of users of financial statements.
On the basis of feedback from users of financial statements, the IASB thinks that this presentation best conveys an overall understanding of a lessee's lease portfolio and improves the transparency of the information.
Although noting that there are significant similarities between right-of-use assets and other assets and between lease liabilities and other financial liabilities, the IASB did not adopt this approach because
information about a lessee's lease portfolio might be obscured by being included within different disclosures about different types of assets and liabilities.
Consequently, this approach might compromise the transparency and usefulness of lease information for users of financial statements.
The IASB concluded that this approach is appropriate because in general each contract is negotiated separately, with the counterparty to the sublease being a different entity from the counterparty to the head lease.
Accordingly, for an intermediate lessor, the obligations that arise from the head lease are generally not extinguished by the terms and conditions of the sublease.
an intermediate lessor (ie the lessor in a sublease) does not own the underlying asset and does not recognise that underlying asset in its balance sheet.
In the IASB's view, the intermediate lessor's accounting should be based on the asset that the intermediate lessor controls (ie the right-of-use asset) and not the underlying asset that is controlled by the head lessor.
an intermediate lessor's risks associated with a right-of-use asset can be converted into credit risk by entering into a sublease, the term of which covers most or all of the term of the head lease.
Accounting for such a sublease as a finance lease (by classifying it by reference to the right-of-use asset) would reflect that risk, because the intermediate lessor would recognise the net investment in the sublease (a receivable) rather than a right-of-use asset.
if a sublease is for all of the remaining term of the corresponding head lease, the intermediate lessor no longer has the right to use the underlying asset.
In the IASB's view, it is appropriate for an intermediate lessor in such a case to derecognise the right-of-use asset and recognise the net investment in the sublease.
The IASB observed that, in classifying a sublease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, an intermediate lessor will classify more subleases as finance leases than it would have done if those same subleases were classified by reference to the underlying asset.
Accordingly, a lessor may classify similar leases (for example, those with a similar lease term for a similar underlying asset) differently depending on whether the lessor owns or leases the underlying asset.
However, the IASB concluded that any difference in classification reflects real economic differences.
The intermediate lessor only has a right to use the underlying asset for a period of time.
If the sublease is for all of the remaining term of the head lease, the intermediate lessor has in effect transferred that right to another party.
In contrast, in an operating lease of an owned asset, the lessor would expect to derive economic benefits from the underlying asset at the end of the lease term.
This is because the IASB decided that specific requirements were not warranted because there is sufficient guidance elsewhere in IFRS.
The IASB considered whether to create an exception that would permit or require an intermediate lessor to offset assets and liabilities arising from a head lease and a sublease of the same underlying asset.
However, the IASB noted that the exposures arising from those assets and liabilities are different from the exposures arising from a single net lease receivable or lease liability, and concluded that presenting these on a net basis could provide misleading information about an intermediate lessor's financial position, because it could obscure the existence of some transactions.
Defining initial direct costs in this way means that the costs incurred by a lessor to obtain a lease are accounted for consistently with costs incurred to obtain other contracts with customers.
the consideration received for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope.
This is because, in the IASB's view, such a modification in substance represents the creation of a new lease that is separate from the original lease.
The IASB expects that this approach will not result in any substantive change to previous lessor accounting for modifications of finance leases.
It is also expected that this approach will not result in any substantive change to previous lessor accounting.
Lessors informed the Board that, like lessees, they face many practical challenges associated with large volumes of covid-19-related rent concessions.
Having considered the feedback, the Board decided not to provide a practical expedient for lessors for the following reasons
Consequently, to ensure consistency in financial reporting, a practical expedient for lessors would have to include new recognition and measurement requirements.
Such requirements might not effectively address all of the practical challenges identified by lessors, and might have unintended consequences.
Such requirements would also take time to develop, preventing a practical expedient from being provided in time to be useful.
It had noted that, for such a lease, significant risks and rewards associated with the land during the lease term would have been transferred by the lessor despite there being no transfer of title.
BCZ243 The IASB had also noted that the lessor in leases of this type will typically be in a position economically similar to an entity that sold the land and buildings.
The IASB had concluded that the accounting for the land element as a finance lease in such circumstances would be consistent with the economic position of the lessor.
However, respondents to that Exposure Draft had questioned whether the relevant fair values were the fair values of the underlying land and buildings or the fair values of the leasehold interests in the land and buildings.
In contrast, the future economic benefits of a building are likely to be used up, at the least to some extent, over the lease term.
Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect that the lease payments relating to the building would be set at a level that enabled the lessor not only to make a return on initial investment, but also to recoup the value of the building used up over the term of the lease.
In the case of land, the lessor would not normally need compensation for using up the land.
In other words, the weighting should reflect the leasehold interest in the land element and the buildings element of the lease at the inception date.
In the extreme case that a building is fully depreciated over the lease term, the lease payments would need to be weighted to provide a return plus the full depreciation of the building's value at the inception of the lease.
The leasehold interest in the land would, assuming a residual value that equals its value at the inception of the lease, have a weighting that reflects only a return on the initial investment.
The IASB decided to allow land and buildings to be treated as a single unit when the land element is immaterial.
In particular, some investors and analysts requested additional information about a lessor's exposure to residual asset risk.
Information about residual asset risk (paragraph 92(b))
Particularly for leases classified as operating leases, lessors could retain significant residual asset risk and little, if any, information was generally available about that exposure to risk in the financial statements.
A decline in the market value of, for example, leased equipment and vehicles at a rate greater than the rate the lessor projected when pricing the lease would adversely affect the profitability of the lease.
Uncertainty about the residual value of the underlying asset at the end of the lease is often a lessor's primary risk.
The IASB also noted that disclosing information about residual asset risk will also provide users of financial statements with useful information about the distribution of risk for a lessor between credit risk relating to lease payments receivable and residual asset risk related to the interest in the underlying asset.
Although it is fundamental to a lessor's business that the lessor manage its exposure to residual asset risk, the IASB thought that the costs associated with having to disclose, and have audited, fair value information about residual assets would outweigh the benefit for users of financial statements.
The IASB observed that a lessor accounts for assets leased under operating leases similarly to owned assets that are held and used (for example, in the lessor's operations).
However, leased and owned assets are typically used for different purposes — ie leased assets generate rental income rather than contributing towards any other revenue-generating activity of the lessor.
For that reason, the IASB concluded that users of financial statements would benefit from obtaining information about leased assets that generate rental income separately from owned assets held and used by the lessor.
In the IASB's view, a more detailed maturity analysis will enable users of financial statements to more accurately forecast future lease cash flows and estimate liquidity risk.
On the basis of the feedback received, the IASB concluded that this information is useful to users of financial statements and is not otherwise available.
In reaching its decisions on sale and leaseback transactions, the IASB noted that
the presence of a leaseback (ie the seller-lessee obtaining the right to use the underlying asset for a period of time) does not, in isolation, preclude the seller-lessee from concluding that it has transferred the underlying asset to the buyer-lessor.
The fact that the buyer-lessor purchases the underlying asset from the entity that is the lessee in the subsequent leaseback does not change the buyer-lessor's ability to obtain control of the underlying asset.
The lessor may not receive physical possession of the asset until the end of the lease term (for example, a vehicle could be delivered directly by a manufacturer to the lessee, even though the lessor purchases the vehicle from the manufacturer).
Similarly, the buyer-lessor may not receive physical possession of the underlying asset in a sale and leaseback transaction until the end of the lease term.
In the IASB's view, these circumstances do not, in isolation, preclude the seller-lessee from concluding that it has transferred the underlying asset to the buyer-lessor.
Consequently, if the seller-lessee has a substantive repurchase option with respect to the underlying asset, then no sale has occurred.
In particular, they questioned the rationale for having a higher threshold for sale accounting in a sale and leaseback transaction than for any other sale.
This is because such a transaction represents, in substance, a financing arrangement.
The IASB decided that the gain or loss recognised by a seller-lessee on a completed sale in a sale and leaseback transaction should reflect the amount that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor.
However, from an economic standpoint, the seller-lessee has sold only its interest in the value of the underlying asset at the end of the leaseback — it has retained its right to use the asset for the duration of the leaseback.
The seller-lessee had already obtained that right to use the asset at the time that it purchased the asset — the right of use is an embedded part of the rights that an entity obtains when it purchases, for example, an item of property, plant and equipment.
Accordingly, in the IASB's view, recognising the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor appropriately reflects the economics of the transaction.
For example, the sale price might be more than the fair value of the asset because the leaseback rentals are above a market rate; conversely the sale price might be less than the fair value because the leaseback rentals are below a market rate.
Accounting for the transaction using those amounts could result in the misstatement of gains or losses on disposal of the asset for the seller-lessee and the misstatement of the carrying amount of the asset for the buyer-lessor.
Temporary exception arising from interest rate benchmark reform
BC267D Applying IFRS 16, modifying a lease contract to change the basis for determining the variable lease payments meets the definition of a lease modification because a change in the calculation of the lease payments would change the original terms and conditions determining the consideration for the lease.
That revised discount rate would be determined as the interest rate implicit in the lease for the remainder of the lease term, if that rate can be readily determined, or the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of the modification, if the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined.
Such a requirement might also impose additional cost on preparers, particularly when leases that are referenced to a benchmark rate that is subject to the reform are expected to be amended at different times.
This is because preparers would have to determine a new incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of each such lease modification.
This practical expedient requires remeasurement of the lease liability using a discount rate that reflects the change to the basis for determining the variable lease payments as required by the reform.
This practical expedient would apply to all lease modifications that change the basis for determining future lease payments that are required as a result of the reform (see paragraphs 5.4.6 and 5.4.8 of IFRS 9).
BC267H The practical expedient provided for lease modifications applies only to the lease modifications required by the reform.
BC267J The Board also considered that, from the perspective of a lessor, lease payments included in the measurement of the net investment in a finance lease may include variable lease payments that are referenced to an interest rate benchmark.
The Board decided not to amend the requirements for accounting for modifications to lease contracts from the lessor's perspective.
Effective date and early application (paragraph C1)
Definition of a lease (paragraphs C3–C4)
The IASB decided that, applying this approach, a lessee is permitted to apply some optional practical expedients on a lease-by-lease basis (see paragraphs BC282–BC287).
The IASB decided not to require a full retrospective approach for all lessees because the costs of such an approach could be significant and would be likely to outweigh the benefits.
Nonetheless, the IASB did not wish to prohibit entities from applying a full retrospective approach, because that approach would provide better information to users of financial statements than other approaches.
Although such an approach would be the least costly for preparers to apply, the information provided would not be beneficial for users of financial statements, particularly for entities that enter into long-term operating leases.
Retrospective application with the cumulative effect recognised at the date of initial application
Furthermore, although users of financial statements find the trend information from restated comparative periods useful, many also acknowledged that the costs of full retrospective application with restatement of comparative information would be significant for many lessees and might not be justified.
The IASB observed that the cumulative catch-up transition method responds to feedback from stakeholders by eliminating the need to restate financial information in comparative periods on transition and thereby reducing costs.
To reduce the costs of implementing IFRS 16, the IASB decided to introduce a number of additional practical expedients relating to leases previously classified as operating leases for a lessee that adopts the cumulative catch-up transition method.
These stakeholders thought that the artificial increase in the depreciation charge immediately after transition would distort the financial information provided to users of financial statements.
However, many preparers thought that the cost of capturing historical information, such as lease start dates and historical payment schedules, would still be significant — particularly for entities with a high volume of leases.
This is because the effect of the less costly option (measuring the right-of-use asset equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any previously recognised prepaid or accrued lease payments) is an increase in operating expense (ie higher depreciation) for the remainder of the term of the lease.
The IASB concluded that a lessee is expected to select the less costly option only for leases for which the costs of applying a more accurate transition approach outweigh the benefit of achieving a 'correct' post-transition income statement.
The IASB expects this to apply to leases that are high in volume but low in value but not to leases such as long-term leases of property or large equipment.
A lessee may apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics.
The IASB expects that permitting a lessee to apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of similar leases on transition will provide cost savings to lessees and will not have a significant effect on reported information.
Previously recognised onerous lease provisions
This approach is an alternative to performing an impairment review.
A lessee may exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application.
The IASB expects that including initial direct costs in the measurement of right-of-use assets would not have a significant effect on reported information.
Consequently, the IASB decided that the cost for lessees of requiring initial direct costs to be identified and included in the measurement of right-of-use assets would outweigh the benefits in terms of reported information.
A lessee may use hindsight in applying IFRS 16, for example, in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.
If an intermediate lessor were to continue to apply previous operating lease accounting to these subleases, it would recognise the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, despite the fact that, in effect, it no longer has a right to use the underlying asset.
The IASB thought that this could be misleading for users of financial statements.
In response to feedback from stakeholders, the IASB decided to provide transition requirements for sale and leaseback transactions that are consistent with the general transition requirements for all leases.
However, the IASB concluded that the costs of performing the reassessment would not be justified.
The IASB concluded that the costs of applying a retrospective approach would outweigh the benefits in terms of reported information.
The IASB decided that when the acquiree in a business combination is a lessee, the acquirer should measure the acquiree's lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments as if the acquired lease were a new lease at the date of acquisition.
The acquiree's right-of-use asset should be measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, with an adjustment for any off-market terms present in the lease.
However, in the IASB's view, the costs associated with measuring lease assets and lease liabilities at fair value would outweigh the benefits because obtaining fair value information might be difficult and, thus, costly.
Such a requirement would be consistent with the general principles of IFRS 3, under which assets and liabilities relating to contracts with off-market terms are recognised separately in the balance sheet and not subsumed within goodwill on acquisition.
However, the IASB observed that the effect of any such off-market terms would rarely be material for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
This is because the IASB is not aware of, nor is it possible to consider, the accounting for leases required by every other GAAP.
The IASB and the FASB reached different decisions about the lessee accounting model.
The differences largely affect leases that were previously classified as operating leases.
The IASB's reasons are explained in paragraphs BC41–BC56.
The FASB decided upon a dual lessee accounting model that requires a lessee to classify leases in a similar manner to the previous US GAAP requirements for distinguishing between operating leases and capital leases.
Under the FASB lessee accounting model, a lessee
accounts for finance leases (ie leases previously classified as capital leases) similarly to the IASB model; and
accounts for operating leases by
recognising right-of-use assets and lease liabilities;
measuring lease liabilities in the same way as they would be measured applying IFRS 16, but without a requirement to reassess variable lease payments;
(iii) recognising a single lease expense typically on a straight-line basis over the lease term; and
(iv) presenting total cash paid within operating activities in the statement of cash flows.
The IASB's reasons are explained in paragraphs BC233–BC234.
The FASB decided to require an intermediate lessor to determine the classification of the sublease by reference to the underlying asset.
The IASB's reasons are explained in paragraph BC266.
The FASB decided to require a seller-lessee to account for any gain or loss on sale consistently with the guidance that would apply to any other sale of an asset.
These differences are primarily a consequence of either the differences between the lessee accounting models or differences between other requirements of IFRS and US GAAP that are relevant to leases (for example, differences in the general disclosure requirements applicable to financial liabilities).
The IASB's reasons are explained in paragraphs BC98–BC104.
The FASB decided not to include such an exemption.
The IASB's reasons are explained in paragraphs BC188–BC190.
The FASB decided not to include any requirements to reassess variable lease payments.
firstly, Mr Zhang does not support retaining a dual accounting model for lessors while requiring a single accounting model for lessees; and
Mr Zhang agrees with the right-of-use lessee accounting model and believes that it should be applied symmetrically to lessor accounting. Mr Zhang is of the view that a lessor should recognise a lease receivable and a residual asset for all leases for which a lessee recognises a lease liability and a right-of-use asset.
He believes that it is conceptually inconsistent to require a single accounting model for lessees while retaining a dual accounting model for lessors.
This is because the nature of the risks associated with a financial asset are different from those of the underlying asset, and information about those different risks is of great importance to users of a lessor's financial statements. DO4 Additionally, Mr Zhang is concerned about the complexity and potential for misapplication of the dual lessor accounting model.
Mr Zhang also disagrees with the recognition exemption for leases of low-value assets of a lessee because he does not believe that these leases should be treated differently from a lessee's other leases.
Mr Zhang believes that the recognition exemption for leases of low-value assets is unnecessary.
When leases of low-value assets are material in the aggregate, Mr Zhang believes that recognising assets and liabilities has significant benefit.
Mr Zhang also thinks that the costs of recognising assets and liabilities would be mitigated because an entity would have a record of leases of low-value assets for internal control purposes.
The only incremental cost might be the cost associated with applying a discount rate to the lease payments.
Mr Zhang believes that the recognition exemption has the potential to set an inappropriate precedent by implying that the materiality guidance in IFRS is insufficient to capture contracts for which the costs of applying IFRS outweigh the benefits. Mr Zhang believes that a similar argument could be used to justify many other exemptions from applying the requirements in IFRS.
Mr Zhang is concerned that entities that require material amounts of low-value assets would be incentivised to lease those assets rather than buy them in order to achieve off balance sheet accounting.
Finally, Mr Zhang is concerned about the operationality of determining whether an asset is of 'low value'.
He notes that the same asset, when new, can have a different value in different markets, and that the value of a particular asset, when new, can change over time.
PRESENTATION OF A STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
REPORTING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES
REPORTING CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES
CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER BUSINESSES
CHANGES IN LIABILITIES ARISING FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES
COMPONENTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Information about the cash flows of an entity is useful in providing users of financial statements with a basis to assess the ability of the entity to generate cash and cash equivalents and the needs of the entity to utilise those cash flows.
The economic decisions that are taken by users require an evaluation of the ability of an entity to generate cash and cash equivalents and the timing and certainty of their generation.
The objective of this Standard is to require the provision of information about the historical changes in cash and cash equivalents of an entity by means of a statement of cash flows which classifies cash flows during the period from operating, investing and financing activities.
This is the case regardless of the nature of the entity's activities and irrespective of whether cash can be viewed as the product of the entity, as may be the case with a financial institution.
Entities need cash for essentially the same reasons however different their principal revenue-producing activities might be.
They need cash to conduct their operations, to pay their obligations, and to provide returns to their investors.
Accordingly, this Standard requires all entities to present a statement of cash flows.
Cash flow information is useful in assessing the ability of the entity to generate cash and cash equivalents and enables users to develop models to assess and compare the present value of the future cash flows of different entities.
It is also useful in checking the accuracy of past assessments of future cash flows and in examining the relationship between profitability and net cash flow and the impact of changing prices.
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash flows are inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents.
Operating activities are the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity and other activities that are not investing or financing activities.
Investing activities are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.
Financing activities are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the contributed equity and borrowings of the entity.
For an investment to qualify as a cash equivalent it must be readily convertible to a known amount of cash and be subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Equity investments are excluded from cash equivalents unless they are, in substance, cash equivalents, for example in the case of preferred shares acquired within a short period of their maturity and with a specified redemption date.
However, in some countries, bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand form an integral part of an entity's cash management.
In these circumstances, bank overdrafts are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
A characteristic of such banking arrangements is that the bank balance often fluctuates from being positive to overdrawn.
Cash management includes the investment of excess cash in cash equivalents.
Presentation of a statement of cash flows
Classification by activity provides information that allows users to assess the impact of those activities on the financial position of the entity and the amount of its cash and cash equivalents.
This information may also be used to evaluate the relationships among those activities.
For example, when the cash repayment of a loan includes both interest and capital, the interest element may be classified as an operating activity and the capital element is classified as a financing activity.
Information about the specific components of historical operating cash flows is useful, in conjunction with other information, in forecasting future operating cash flows.
cash receipts from the sale of goods and the rendering of services;
cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenue;
cash payments to suppliers for goods and services;
cash payments to and on behalf of employees;
cash receipts and cash payments of an insurance entity for premiums and claims, annuities and other policy benefits;
cash receipts and payments from contracts held for dealing or trading purposes.
Some transactions, such as the sale of an item of plant, may give rise to a gain or loss that is included in recognised profit or loss.
The cash flows relating to such transactions are cash flows from investing activities.
The cash receipts from rents and subsequent sales of such assets are also cash flows from operating activities.
Therefore, cash flows arising from the purchase and sale of dealing or trading securities are classified as operating activities.
Similarly, cash advances and loans made by financial institutions are usually classified as operating activities since they relate to the main revenue-producing activity of that entity.
Only expenditures that result in a recognised asset in the statement of financial position are eligible for classification as investing activities.
Examples of cash flows arising from investing activities are
cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other long-term assets.
These payments include those relating to capitalised development costs and self-constructed property, plant and equipment;
cash receipts from sales of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other long-term assets;
cash payments to acquire equity or debt instruments of other entities and interests in joint ventures (other than payments for those instruments considered to be cash equivalents or those held for dealing or trading purposes);
cash receipts from sales of equity or debt instruments of other entities and interests in joint ventures (other than receipts for those instruments considered to be cash equivalents and those held for dealing or trading purposes);
cash advances and loans made to other parties (other than advances and loans made by a financial institution);
cash receipts from the repayment of advances and loans made to other parties (other than advances and loans of a financial institution);
cash receipts from futures contracts, forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts except when the contracts are held for dealing or trading purposes, or the receipts are classified as financing activities.
When a contract is accounted for as a hedge of an identifiable position the cash flows of the contract are classified in the same manner as the cash flows of the position being hedged.
Examples of cash flows arising from financing activities are
cash proceeds from issuing shares or other equity instruments;
cash payments to owners to acquire or redeem the entity's shares;
cash proceeds from issuing debentures, loans, notes, bonds, mortgages and other short-term or long-term borrowings;
cash payments by a lessee for the reduction of the outstanding liability relating to a lease.
Reporting cash flows from operating activities
the indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows.
The direct method provides information which may be useful in estimating future cash flows and which is not available under the indirect method.
Under the direct method, information about major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments may be obtained either
by adjusting sales, cost of sales (interest and similar income and interest expense and similar charges for a financial institution) and other items in the statement of comprehensive income for
changes during the period in inventories and operating receivables and payables;
all other items for which the cash effects are investing or financing cash flows.
Alternatively, the net cash flow from operating activities may be presented under the indirect method by showing the revenues and expenses disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income and the changes during the period in inventories and operating receivables and payables.
Reporting cash flows from investing and financing activities
Reporting cash flows on a net basis
cash receipts and payments for items in which the turnover is quick, the amounts are large, and the maturities are short.
the acceptance and repayment of demand deposits of a bank;
rents collected on behalf of, and paid over to, the owners of properties.
Examples of cash receipts and payments referred to in paragraph 22(b) are advances made for, and the repayment of
principal amounts relating to credit card customers;
cash receipts and payments for the acceptance and repayment of deposits with a fixed maturity date;
cash advances and loans made to customers and the repayment of those advances and loans.
This permits the use of an exchange rate that approximates the actual rate.
For example, a weighted average exchange rate for a period may be used for recording foreign currency transactions or the translation of the cash flows of a foreign subsidiary.
However, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents held or due in a foreign currency is reported in the statement of cash flows in order to reconcile cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the period.
Each shall be classified in a consistent manner from period to period as either operating, investing or financing activities.
However, there is no consensus on the classification of these cash flows for other entities.
Interest paid and interest and dividends received may be classified as operating cash flows because they enter into the determination of profit or loss.
Alternatively, interest paid and interest and dividends received may be classified as financing cash flows and investing cash flows respectively, because they are costs of obtaining financial resources or returns on investments.
Alternatively, dividends paid may be classified as a component of cash flows from operating activities in order to assist users to determine the ability of an entity to pay dividends out of operating cash flows.
While tax expense may be readily identifiable with investing or financing activities, the related tax cash flows are often impracticable to identify and may arise in a different period from the cash flows of the underlying transaction.
Therefore, taxes paid are usually classified as cash flows from operating activities.
However, when it is practicable to identify the tax cash flow with an individual transaction that gives rise to cash flows that are classified as investing or financing activities the tax cash flow is classified as an investing or financing activity as appropriate.
Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries and other businesses
the total consideration paid or received;
the portion of the consideration consisting of cash and cash equivalents;
the amount of the assets and liabilities other than cash or cash equivalents in the subsidiaries or other businesses over which control is obtained or lost, summarised by each major category.
The cash flow effects of losing control are not deducted from those of obtaining control.
Cash flows arising from changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control shall be classified as cash flows from financing activities, unless the subsidiary is held by an investment entity, as defined in IFRS 10, and is required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Such transactions shall be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements in a way that provides all the relevant information about these investing and financing activities.
The exclusion of non-cash transactions from the statement of cash flows is consistent with the objective of a statement of cash flows as these items do not involve cash flows in the current period.
Examples of non-cash transactions are
the acquisition of assets either by assuming directly related liabilities or by means of a lease;
the conversion of debt to equity.
Changes in liabilities arising from financing activities
An entity shall provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes.
To the extent necessary to satisfy the requirement in paragraph 44A, an entity shall disclose the following changes in liabilities arising from financing activities
changes from financing cash flows;
changes arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other businesses;
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates;
changes in fair values; and
In addition, the disclosure requirement in paragraph 44A also applies to changes in financial assets (for example, assets that hedge liabilities arising from financing activities) if cash flows from those financial assets were, or future cash flows will be, included in cash flows from financing activities.
Where an entity discloses such a reconciliation, it shall provide sufficient information to enable users of the financial statements to link items included in the reconciliation to the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows.
If an entity provides the disclosure required by paragraph 44A in combination with disclosures of changes in other assets and liabilities, it shall disclose the changes in liabilities arising from financing activities separately from changes in those other assets and liabilities.
Components of cash and cash equivalents
Examples include cash and cash equivalent balances held by a subsidiary that operates in a country where exchange controls or other legal restrictions apply when the balances are not available for general use by the parent or other subsidiaries.
Disclosure of this information, together with a commentary by management, is encouraged and may include
the amount of undrawn borrowing facilities that may be available for future operating activities and to settle capital commitments, indicating any restrictions on the use of these facilities;
An entity that does not invest adequately in the maintenance of its operating capacity may be prejudicing future profitability for the sake of current liquidity and distributions to owners.
The amendments shall be applied retrospectively.

An entity shall apply this Standard, including the use of any practical expedients, consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.
non-monetary exchanges between entities in the same line of business to facilitate sales to customers or potential customers.
A customer is a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities in exchange for consideration.
A counterparty to the contract would not be a customer if, for example, the counterparty has contracted with the entity to participate in an activity or process in which the parties to the contract share in the risks and benefits that result from the activity or process (such as developing an asset in a collaboration arrangement) rather than to obtain the output of the entity's ordinary activities.
An entity shall apply those paragraphs only to the costs incurred that relate to a contract with a customer (or part of that contract) that is within the scope of this Standard.
the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations;
the entity can identify each party's rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred;
the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred;
it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.
In evaluating whether collectability of an amount of consideration is probable, an entity shall consider only the customer's ability and intention to pay that amount of consideration when it is due.
An entity shall consider those practices and processes in determining whether and when an agreement with a customer creates enforceable rights and obligations.
Other contracts may automatically renew on a periodic basis that is specified in the contract.
An entity shall apply this Standard to the duration of the contract (ie the contractual period) in which the parties to the contract have present enforceable rights and obligations.
A contract is wholly unperformed if both of the following criteria are met
the entity has not yet transferred any promised goods or services to the customer; and
the entity has not yet received, and is not yet entitled to receive, any consideration in exchange for promised goods or services.
For example, if a customer's ability to pay the consideration deteriorates significantly, an entity would reassess whether it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for the remaining goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.
the entity has no remaining obligations to transfer goods or services to the customer and all, or substantially all, of the consideration promised by the customer has been received by the entity and is non-refundable; or
Depending on the facts and circumstances relating to the contract, the liability recognised represents the entity's obligation to either transfer goods or services in the future or refund the consideration received.
In either case, the liability shall be measured at the amount of consideration received from the customer.
the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective;
In some industries and jurisdictions, a contract modification may be described as a change order, a variation or an amendment.
A contract modification exists when the parties to a contract approve a modification that either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations of the parties to the contract.
A contract modification could be approved in writing, by oral agreement or implied by customary business practices.
If the parties to the contract have not approved a contract modification, an entity shall continue to apply this Standard to the existing contract until the contract modification is approved.
In determining whether the rights and obligations that are created or changed by a modification are enforceable, an entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances including the terms of the contract and other evidence.
the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects the entity's stand-alone selling prices of the additional promised goods or services and any appropriate adjustments to that price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.
For example, an entity may adjust the stand-alone selling price of an additional good or service for a discount that the customer receives, because it is not necessary for the entity to incur the selling-related costs that it would incur when selling a similar good or service to a new customer.
The amount of consideration to be allocated to the remaining performance obligations (or to the remaining distinct goods or services in a single performance obligation identified in accordance with paragraph 22(b)) is the sum of
the consideration promised as part of the contract modification.
The effect that the contract modification has on the transaction price, and on the entity's measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, is recognised as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) at the date of the contract modification (ie the adjustment to revenue is made on a cumulative catch-up basis).
a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or
However, the performance obligations identified in a contract with a customer may not be limited to the goods or services that are explicitly stated in that contract.
This is because a contract with a customer may also include promises that are implied by an entity's customary business practices, published policies or specific statements if, at the time of entering into the contract, those promises create a valid expectation of the customer that the entity will transfer a good or service to the customer.
For example, a services provider may need to perform various administrative tasks to set up a contract.
The performance of those tasks does not transfer a service to the customer as the tasks are performed.
Therefore, those setup activities are not a performance obligation.
sale of goods produced by an entity (for example, inventory of a manufacturer);
resale of goods purchased by an entity (for example, merchandise of a retailer);
resale of rights to goods or services purchased by an entity (for example, a ticket resold by an entity acting as a principal, as described in paragraphs B34–B38);
providing a service of standing ready to provide goods or services (for example, unspecified updates to software that are provided on a when-and-if-available basis) or of making goods or services available for a customer to use as and when the customer decides;
providing a service of arranging for another party to transfer goods or services to a customer (for example, acting as an agent of another party, as described in paragraphs B34–B38);
granting rights to goods or services to be provided in the future that a customer can resell or provide to its customer (for example, an entity selling a product to a retailer promises to transfer an additional good or service to an individual who purchases the product from the retailer);
constructing, manufacturing or developing an asset on behalf of a customer;
granting licences (see paragraphs B52–B63B); and
the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (ie the good or service is capable of being distinct); and
For some goods or services, a customer may be able to benefit from a good or service on its own.
For other goods or services, a customer may be able to benefit from the good or service only in conjunction with other readily available resources.
A readily available resource is a good or service that is sold separately (by the entity or another entity) or a resource that the customer has already obtained from the entity (including goods or services that the entity will have already transferred to the customer under the contract) or from other transactions or events.
Various factors may provide evidence that the customer can benefit from a good or service either on its own or in conjunction with other readily available resources.
For example, the fact that the entity regularly sells a good or service separately would indicate that a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other readily available resources.
the entity provides a significant service of integrating the goods or services with other goods or services promised in the contract into a bundle of goods or services that represent the combined output or outputs for which the customer has contracted.
the goods or services are highly interdependent or highly interrelated.
In some cases, that would result in the entity accounting for all the goods or services promised in a contract as a single performance obligation.
An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset.
If an entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time.
Control of an asset refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset.
Control includes the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of, and obtaining the benefits from, an asset.
The benefits of an asset are the potential cash flows (inflows or savings in outflows) that can be obtained directly or indirectly in many ways, such as by
using the asset to produce goods or provide services (including public services);
using the asset to enhance the value of other assets;
using the asset to settle liabilities or reduce expenses;
selling or exchanging the asset;
pledging the asset to secure a loan; and
the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance as the entity performs (see paragraphs B3–B4);
the entity's performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in progress) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (see paragraph B5); or
the entity's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see paragraph 36) and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (see paragraph 37).
The assessment of whether an asset has an alternative use to the entity is made at contract inception.
After contract inception, an entity shall not update the assessment of the alternative use of an asset unless the parties to the contract approve a contract modification that substantively changes the performance obligation.
Paragraphs B6–B8 provide guidance for assessing whether an asset has an alternative use to an entity.
The right to payment for performance completed to date does not need to be for a fixed amount.
However, at all times throughout the duration of the contract, the entity must be entitled to an amount that at least compensates the entity for performance completed to date if the contract is terminated by the customer or another party for reasons other than the entity's failure to perform as promised.
Paragraphs B9–B13 provide guidance for assessing the existence and enforceability of a right to payment and whether an entity's right to payment would entitle the entity to be paid for its performance completed to date.
In addition, an entity shall consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following
Therefore, the transfer of legal title of an asset may indicate that the customer has obtained control of the asset.
If an entity retains legal title solely as protection against the customer's failure to pay, those rights of the entity would not preclude the customer from obtaining control of an asset.
However, physical possession may not coincide with control of an asset.
For example, in some repurchase agreements and in some consignment arrangements, a customer or consignee may have physical possession of an asset that the entity controls.
Conversely, in some bill-and-hold arrangements, the entity may have physical possession of an asset that the customer controls.
However, when evaluating the risks and rewards of ownership of a promised asset, an entity shall exclude any risks that give rise to a separate performance obligation in addition to the performance obligation to transfer the asset.
For example, an entity may have transferred control of an asset to a customer but not yet satisfied an additional performance obligation to provide maintenance services related to the transferred asset.
To evaluate the effect of a contractual customer acceptance clause on when control of an asset is transferred, an entity shall consider the guidance in paragraphs B83–B86.
The objective when measuring progress is to depict an entity's performance in transferring control of goods or services promised to a customer (ie the satisfaction of an entity's performance obligation).
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall remeasure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation satisfied over time.
Paragraphs B14–B19 provide guidance for using output methods and input methods to measure an entity's progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation.
In determining the appropriate method for measuring progress, an entity shall consider the nature of the good or service that the entity promised to transfer to the customer.
Conversely, an entity shall include in the measure of progress any goods or services for which the entity does transfer control to a customer when satisfying that performance obligation.
An entity would not be able to reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation if it lacks reliable information that would be required to apply an appropriate method of measuring progress.
In those circumstances, the entity shall recognise revenue only to the extent of the costs incurred until such time that it can reasonably measure the outcome of the performance obligation.
The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.
When determining the transaction price, an entity shall consider the effects of all of the following
The promised consideration can also vary if an entity's entitlement to the consideration is contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event.
For example, an amount of consideration would be variable if either a product was sold with a right of return or a fixed amount is promised as a performance bonus on achievement of a specified milestone.
In addition to the terms of the contract, the promised consideration is variable if either of the following circumstances exists
other facts and circumstances indicate that the entity's intention, when entering into the contract with the customer, is to offer a price concession to the customer.
An expected value may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if an entity has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics.
In addition, an entity shall consider all the information (historical, current and forecast) that is reasonably available to the entity and shall identify a reasonable number of possible consideration amounts.
The information that an entity uses to estimate the amount of variable consideration would typically be similar to the information that the entity's management uses during the bid-and-proposal process and in establishing prices for promised goods or services.
A refund liability is measured at the amount of consideration received (or receivable) for which the entity does not expect to be entitled (ie amounts not included in the transaction price).
Constraining estimates of variable consideration
Factors that could increase the likelihood or the magnitude of a revenue reversal include, but are not limited to, any of the following
the amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside the entity's influence.
the uncertainty about the amount of consideration is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time.
the entity's experience (or other evidence) with similar types of contracts is limited, or that experience (or other evidence) has limited predictive value.
the entity has a practice of either offering a broad range of price concessions or changing the payment terms and conditions of similar contracts in similar circumstances.
the contract has a large number and broad range of possible consideration amounts.
In those circumstances, the contract contains a significant financing component.
A significant financing component may exist regardless of whether the promise of financing is explicitly stated in the contract or implied by the payment terms agreed to by the parties to the contract.
An entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether a contract contains a financing component and whether that financing component is significant to the contract, including both of the following
the difference, if any, between the amount of promised consideration and the cash selling price of the promised goods or services; and
the combined effect of both of the following
the expected length of time between when the entity transfers the promised goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services; and
the prevailing interest rates in the relevant market.
the customer paid for the goods or services in advance and the timing of the transfer of those goods or services is at the discretion of the customer.
a substantial amount of the consideration promised by the customer is variable and the amount or timing of that consideration varies on the basis of the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event that is not substantially within the control of the customer or the entity (for example, if the consideration is a sales-based royalty).
the difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price of the good or service (as described in paragraph 61) arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or the entity, and the difference between those amounts is proportional to the reason for the difference.
For example, the payment terms might provide the entity or the customer with protection from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.
That rate would reflect the credit characteristics of the party receiving financing in the contract, as well as any collateral or security provided by the customer or the entity, including assets transferred in the contract.
An entity may be able to determine that rate by identifying the rate that discounts the nominal amount of the promised consideration to the price that the customer would pay in cash for the goods or services when (or as) they transfer to the customer.
After contract inception, an entity shall not update the discount rate for changes in interest rates or other circumstances (such as a change in the assessment of the customer's credit risk).
Interest revenue or interest expense is recognised only to the extent that a contract asset (or receivable) or a contract liability is recognised in accounting for a contract with a customer.
If so, the entity shall account for the contributed goods or services as non-cash consideration received from the customer.
If the amount of consideration payable to the customer exceeds the fair value of the distinct good or service that the entity receives from the customer, then the entity shall account for such an excess as a reduction of the transaction price.
If the entity cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received from the customer, it shall account for all of the consideration payable to the customer as a reduction of the transaction price.
the entity recognises revenue for the transfer of the related goods or services to the customer; and
the entity pays or promises to pay the consideration (even if the payment is conditional on a future event).
That promise might be implied by the entity's customary business practices.
The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.
A contractually stated price or a list price for a good or service may be (but shall not be presumed to be) the stand-alone selling price of that good or service.
When estimating a stand-alone selling price, an entity shall consider all information (including market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available to the entity.
In doing so, an entity shall maximise the use of observable inputs and apply estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances.
That approach might also include referring to prices from the entity's competitors for similar goods or services and adjusting those prices as necessary to reflect the entity's costs and margins.
However, an entity may use a residual approach to estimate, in accordance with paragraph 78, the stand-alone selling price of a good or service only if one of the following criteria is met
the entity sells the same good or service to different customers (at or near the same time) for a broad range of amounts (ie the selling price is highly variable because a representative stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence); or
the entity has not yet established a price for that good or service and the good or service has not previously been sold on a stand-alone basis (ie the selling price is uncertain).
For example, an entity may use a residual approach to estimate the aggregate stand-alone selling price for those promised goods or services with highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices and then use another method to estimate the stand-alone selling prices of the individual goods or services relative to that estimated aggregate stand-alone selling price determined by the residual approach.
the entity regularly sells each distinct good or service (or each bundle of distinct goods or services) in the contract on a stand-alone basis;
the entity also regularly sells on a stand-alone basis a bundle (or bundles) of some of those distinct goods or services at a discount to the stand-alone selling prices of the goods or services in each bundle; and
the terms of a variable payment relate specifically to the entity's efforts to satisfy the performance obligation or transfer the distinct good or service (or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation or transferring the distinct good or service); and
Consequently, an entity shall not reallocate the transaction price to reflect changes in stand-alone selling prices after contract inception.
Amounts allocated to a satisfied performance obligation shall be recognised as revenue, or as a reduction of revenue, in the period in which the transaction price changes.
the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the entity can specifically identify (for example, costs relating to services to be provided under renewal of an existing contract or costs of designing an asset to be transferred under a specific contract that has not yet been approved);
the costs generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; and
the costs are expected to be recovered.
direct materials (for example, supplies used in providing the promised services to a customer);
allocations of costs that relate directly to the contract or to contract activities (for example, costs of contract management and supervision, insurance and depreciation of tools, equipment and right-of-use assets used in fulfilling the contract);
costs that are explicitly chargeable to the customer under the contract; and
general and administrative costs (unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer under the contract, in which case an entity shall evaluate those costs in accordance with paragraph 97);
costs that relate to satisfied performance obligations (or partially satisfied performance obligations) in the contract (ie costs that relate to past performance); and
costs for which an entity cannot distinguish whether the costs relate to unsatisfied performance obligations or to satisfied performance obligations (or partially satisfied performance obligations).
the remaining amount of consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services to which the asset relates; less
the costs that relate directly to providing those goods or services and that have not been recognised as expenses (see paragraph 97).
The increased carrying amount of the asset shall not exceed the amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation) if no impairment loss had been recognised previously.
An entity shall present any unconditional rights to consideration separately as a receivable.
A contract liability is an entity's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer.
A contract asset is an entity's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer.
A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due.
For example, an entity would recognise a receivable if it has a present right to payment even though that amount may be subject to refund in the future.
If an entity uses an alternative description for a contract asset, the entity shall provide sufficient information for a user of the financial statements to distinguish between receivables and contract assets.
To achieve that objective, an entity shall disclose qualitative and quantitative information about all of the following
An entity shall aggregate or disaggregate disclosures so that useful information is not obscured by either the inclusion of a large amount of insignificant detail or the aggregation of items that have substantially different characteristics.
revenue recognised from contracts with customers, which the entity shall disclose separately from its other sources of revenue; and
any impairment losses recognised (in accordance with IFRS 9) on any receivables or contract assets arising from an entity's contracts with customers, which the entity shall disclose separately from impairment losses from other contracts.
An entity shall apply the guidance in paragraphs B87–B89 when selecting the categories to use to disaggregate revenue.
the opening and closing balances of receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers, if not otherwise separately presented or disclosed;
revenue recognised in the reporting period that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period; and
revenue recognised in the reporting period from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods (for example, changes in transaction price).
The explanation provided may use qualitative information.
The explanation shall include qualitative and quantitative information.
Examples of changes in the entity's balances of contract assets and contract liabilities include any of the following
changes due to business combinations;
cumulative catch-up adjustments to revenue that affect the corresponding contract asset or contract liability, including adjustments arising from a change in the measure of progress, a change in an estimate of the transaction price (including any changes in the assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) or a contract modification;
impairment of a contract asset;
a change in the time frame for a right to consideration to become unconditional (ie for a contract asset to be reclassified to a receivable); and
a change in the time frame for a performance obligation to be satisfied (ie for the recognition of revenue arising from a contract liability).
when the entity typically satisfies its performance obligations (for example, upon shipment, upon delivery, as services are rendered or upon completion of service), including when performance obligations are satisfied in a bill-and-hold arrangement;
the nature of the goods or services that the entity has promised to transfer, highlighting any performance obligations to arrange for another party to transfer goods or services (ie if the entity is acting as an agent);
obligations for returns, refunds and other similar obligations; and
types of warranties and related obligations.
the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of the end of the reporting period; and
an explanation of when the entity expects to recognise as revenue the amount disclosed in accordance with paragraph 120(a), which the entity shall disclose in either of the following ways
on a quantitative basis using the time bands that would be most appropriate for the duration of the remaining performance obligations; or
the entity recognises revenue from the satisfaction of the performance obligation in accordance with paragraph B16.
In particular, an entity shall explain the judgements, and changes in the judgements, used in determining both of the following
the methods used to recognise revenue (for example, a description of the output methods or input methods used and how those methods are applied); and
an explanation of why the methods used provide a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services.
determining the transaction price, which includes, but is not limited to, estimating variable consideration, adjusting the consideration for the effects of the time value of money and measuring non-cash consideration;
assessing whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained;
allocating the transaction price, including estimating stand-alone selling prices of promised goods or services and allocating discounts and variable consideration to a specific part of the contract (if applicable); and
measuring obligations for returns, refunds and other similar obligations.
the method it uses to determine the amortisation for each reporting period.
the amount of amortisation and any impairment losses recognised in the reporting period.
An entity's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time (for example, the entity's future performance).
An entity's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer.
A party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities in exchange for consideration.
Increases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of inflows or enhancements of assets or decreases of liabilities that result in an increase in equity, other than those relating to contributions from equity participants.
A promise in a contract with a customer to transfer to the customer either
(a)  a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or
(b)  a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
Income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities.
stand-alone selling price (of a good or service)
The price at which an entity would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer.
transaction price (for a contract with a customer)
This application guidance is organised into the following categories
performance obligations satisfied over time (paragraphs B2–B13);
methods for measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation (paragraphs B14–B19);
sale with a right of return (paragraphs B20–B27);
principal versus agent considerations (paragraphs B34–B38);
customers' unexercised rights (paragraphs B44–B47);
(m) customer acceptance (paragraphs B83–B86); and
disclosure of disaggregated revenue (paragraphs B87–B89).
the entity's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see paragraphs B6–B8) and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (see paragraphs B9–B13).
Simultaneous receipt and consumption of the benefits of the entity's performance (paragraph 35(a))
For some types of performance obligations, the assessment of whether a customer receives the benefits of an entity's performance as the entity performs and simultaneously consumes those benefits as they are received will be straightforward.
Examples include routine or recurring services (such as a cleaning service) in which the receipt and simultaneous consumption by the customer of the benefits of the entity's performance can be readily identified.
For other types of performance obligations, an entity may not be able to readily identify whether a customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits from the entity's performance as the entity performs.
In those circumstances, a performance obligation is satisfied over time if an entity determines that another entity would not need to substantially re-perform the work that the entity has completed to date if that other entity were to fulfil the remaining performance obligation to the customer.
In determining whether another entity would not need to substantially re-perform the work the entity has completed to date, an entity shall make both of the following assumptions
disregard potential contractual restrictions or practical limitations that otherwise would prevent the entity from transferring the remaining performance obligation to another entity; and
presume that another entity fulfilling the remainder of the performance obligation would not have the benefit of any asset that is presently controlled by the entity and that would remain controlled by the entity if the performance obligation were to transfer to another entity.
Customer controls the asset as it is created or enhanced (paragraph 35(b))
The asset that is being created or enhanced (for example, a work-in-progress asset) could be either tangible or intangible.
Entity's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use (paragraph 35(c))
The possibility of the contract with the customer being terminated is not a relevant consideration in assessing whether the entity would be able to readily direct the asset for another use.
A contractual restriction on an entity's ability to direct an asset for another use must be substantive for the asset not to have an alternative use to the entity.
A contractual restriction is substantive if a customer could enforce its rights to the promised asset if the entity sought to direct the asset for another use.
In contrast, a contractual restriction is not substantive if, for example, an asset is largely interchangeable with other assets that the entity could transfer to another customer without breaching the contract and without incurring significant costs that otherwise would not have been incurred in relation to that contract.
A practical limitation on an entity's ability to direct an asset for another use exists if an entity would incur significant economic losses to direct the asset for another use.
A significant economic loss could arise because the entity either would incur significant costs to rework the asset or would only be able to sell the asset at a significant loss.
For example, an entity may be practically limited from redirecting assets that either have design specifications that are unique to a customer or are located in remote areas.
Right to payment for performance completed to date (paragraph 35(c))
An amount that would compensate an entity for performance completed to date would be an amount that approximates the selling price of the goods or services transferred to date (for example, recovery of the costs incurred by an entity in satisfying the performance obligation plus a reasonable profit margin) rather than compensation for only the entity's potential loss of profit if the contract were to be terminated.
Compensation for a reasonable profit margin need not equal the profit margin expected if the contract was fulfilled as promised, but an entity should be entitled to compensation for either of the following amounts
a proportion of the expected profit margin in the contract that reasonably reflects the extent of the entity's performance under the contract before termination by the customer (or another party); or
a reasonable return on the entity's cost of capital for similar contracts (or the entity's typical operating margin for similar contracts) if the contract-specific margin is higher than the return the entity usually generates from similar contracts.
An entity's right to payment for performance completed to date need not be a present unconditional right to payment.
In many cases, an entity will have an unconditional right to payment only at an agreed-upon milestone or upon complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.
In assessing whether it has a right to payment for performance completed to date, an entity shall consider whether it would have an enforceable right to demand or retain payment for performance completed to date if the contract were to be terminated before completion for reasons other than the entity's failure to perform as promised.
In some contracts, a customer may have a right to terminate the contract only at specified times during the life of the contract or the customer might not have any right to terminate the contract.
If a customer acts to terminate a contract without having the right to terminate the contract at that time (including when a customer fails to perform its obligations as promised), the contract (or other laws) might entitle the entity to continue to transfer to the customer the goods or services promised in the contract and require the customer to pay the consideration promised in exchange for those goods or services.
In those circumstances, an entity has a right to payment for performance completed to date because the entity has a right to continue to perform its obligations in accordance with the contract and to require the customer to perform its obligations (which include paying the promised consideration).
In assessing the existence and enforceability of a right to payment for performance completed to date, an entity shall consider the contractual terms as well as any legislation or legal precedent that could supplement or override those contractual terms.
legislation, administrative practice or legal precedent confers upon the entity a right to payment for performance to date even though that right is not specified in the contract with the customer;
relevant legal precedent indicates that similar rights to payment for performance completed to date in similar contracts have no binding legal effect; or
an entity's customary business practices of choosing not to enforce a right to payment has resulted in the right being rendered unenforceable in that legal environment.
However, notwithstanding that an entity may choose to waive its right to payment in similar contracts, an entity would continue to have a right to payment to date if, in the contract with the customer, its right to payment for performance to date remains enforceable.
The payment schedule specified in a contract does not necessarily indicate whether an entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
Although the payment schedule in a contract specifies the timing and amount of consideration that is payable by a customer, the payment schedule might not necessarily provide evidence of the entity's right to payment for performance completed to date.
This is because, for example, the contract could specify that the consideration received from the customer is refundable for reasons other than the entity failing to perform as promised in the contract.
Methods for measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation
output methods (see paragraphs B15–B17); and
input methods (see paragraphs B18–B19).
Output methods recognise revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract.
Output methods include methods such as surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached, time elapsed and units produced or units delivered.
When an entity evaluates whether to apply an output method to measure its progress, the entity shall consider whether the output selected would faithfully depict the entity's performance towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.
An output method would not provide a faithful depiction of the entity's performance if the output selected would fail to measure some of the goods or services for which control has transferred to the customer.
For example, output methods based on units produced or units delivered would not faithfully depict an entity's performance in satisfying a performance obligation if, at the end of the reporting period, the entity's performance has produced work in progress or finished goods controlled by the customer that are not included in the measurement of the output.
The disadvantages of output methods are that the outputs used to measure progress may not be directly observable and the information required to apply them may not be available to an entity without undue cost.
Therefore, an input method may be necessary.
If the entity's efforts or inputs are expended evenly throughout the performance period, it may be appropriate for the entity to recognise revenue on a straight-line basis.
A shortcoming of input methods is that there may not be a direct relationship between an entity's inputs and the transfer of control of goods or services to a customer.
For instance, when using a cost-based input method, an adjustment to the measure of progress may be required in the following circumstances
In those circumstances, the best depiction of the entity's performance may be to adjust the input method to recognise revenue only to the extent of that cost incurred.
For example, a faithful depiction of an entity's performance might be to recognise revenue at an amount equal to the cost of a good used to satisfy a performance obligation if the entity expects at contract inception that all of the following conditions would be met
the good is not distinct;
the customer is expected to obtain control of the good significantly before receiving services related to the good;
Sale with a right of return
In some contracts, an entity transfers control of a product to a customer and also grants the customer the right to return the product for various reasons (such as dissatisfaction with the product) and receive any combination of the following
a full or partial refund of any consideration paid;
To account for the transfer of products with a right of return (and for some services that are provided subject to a refund), an entity shall recognise all of the following
revenue for the transferred products in the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled (therefore, revenue would not be recognised for the products expected to be returned);
an asset (and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) for its right to recover products from customers on settling the refund liability.
An entity's promise to stand ready to accept a returned product during the return period shall not be accounted for as a performance obligation in addition to the obligation to provide a refund.
For any amounts received (or receivable) for which an entity does not expect to be entitled, the entity shall not recognise revenue when it transfers products to customers but shall recognise those amounts received (or receivable) as a refund liability.
Subsequently, at the end of each reporting period, the entity shall update its assessment of amounts for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the transferred products and make a corresponding change to the transaction price and, therefore, in the amount of revenue recognised.
An entity shall update the measurement of the refund liability at the end of each reporting period for changes in expectations about the amount of refunds.
An entity shall recognise corresponding adjustments as revenue (or reductions of revenue).
An asset recognised for an entity's right to recover products from a customer on settling a refund liability shall initially be measured by reference to the former carrying amount of the product (for example, inventory) less any expected costs to recover those products (including potential decreases in the value to the entity of returned products).
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall update the measurement of the asset arising from changes in expectations about products to be returned.
An entity shall present the asset separately from the refund liability.
Contracts in which a customer may return a defective product in exchange for a functioning product shall be evaluated in accordance with the guidance on warranties in paragraphs B28–B33.
The nature of a warranty can vary significantly across industries and contracts.
Some warranties provide a customer with assurance that the related product will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications.
Other warranties provide the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications.
If a warranty, or a part of a warranty, provides a customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications, the promised service is a performance obligation.
Therefore, an entity shall allocate the transaction price to the product and the service.
If an entity promises both an assurance-type warranty and a service-type warranty but cannot reasonably account for them separately, the entity shall account for both of the warranties together as a single performance obligation.
A law that requires an entity to pay compensation if its products cause harm or damage does not give rise to a performance obligation.
For example, a manufacturer might sell products in a jurisdiction in which the law holds the manufacturer liable for any damages (for example, to personal property) that might be caused by a consumer using a product for its intended purpose.
Similarly, an entity's promise to indemnify the customer for liabilities and damages arising from claims of patent, copyright, trademark or other infringement by the entity's products does not give rise to a performance obligation.
When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, the entity shall determine whether the nature of its promise is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods or services itself (ie the entity is a principal) or to arrange for those goods or services to be provided by the other party (ie the entity is an agent).
An entity determines whether it is a principal or an agent for each specified good or service promised to the customer.
To determine the nature of its promise (as described in paragraph B34), the entity shall
identify the specified goods or services to be provided to the customer (which, for example, could be a right to a good or service to be provided by another party (see paragraph 26)); and
An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to a customer.
However, an entity does not necessarily control a specified good if the entity obtains legal title to that good only momentarily before legal title is transferred to a customer.
a good or another asset from the other party that it then transfers to the customer.
a right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity's behalf.
For example, if an entity provides a significant service of integrating goods or services (see paragraph 29(a)) provided by another party into the specified good or service for which the customer has contracted, the entity controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer.
When (or as) an entity that is a principal satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred.
An entity is an agent if the entity's performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of the specified good or service by another party.
An entity that is an agent does not control the specified good or service provided by another party before that good or service is transferred to the customer.
When (or as) an entity that is an agent satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognises revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party.
An entity's fee or commission might be the net amount of consideration that the entity retains after paying the other party the consideration received in exchange for the goods or services to be provided by that party.
Indicators that an entity controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer (and is therefore a principal (see paragraph B35)) include, but are not limited to, the following
If the entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service, this may indicate that the other party involved in providing the specified good or service is acting on the entity's behalf.
the entity has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer or after transfer of control to the customer (for example, if the customer has a right of return).
the entity has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.
Establishing the price that the customer pays for the specified good or service may indicate that the entity has the ability to direct the use of that good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits.
However, an agent can have discretion in establishing prices in some cases.
For example, an agent may have some flexibility in setting prices in order to generate additional revenue from its service of arranging for goods or services to be provided by other parties to customers.
The indicators in paragraph B37 may be more or less relevant to the assessment of control depending on the nature of the specified good or service and the terms and conditions of the contract.
In addition, different indicators may provide more persuasive evidence in different contracts.
If another entity assumes the entity's performance obligations and contractual rights in the contract so that the entity is no longer obliged to satisfy the performance obligation to transfer the specified good or service to the customer (ie the entity is no longer acting as the principal), the entity shall not recognise revenue for that performance obligation.
Instead, the entity shall evaluate whether to recognise revenue for satisfying a performance obligation to obtain a contract for the other party (ie whether the entity is acting as an agent).
Customer options for additional goods or services
If, in a contract, an entity grants a customer the option to acquire additional goods or services, that option gives rise to a performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that it would not receive without entering into that contract (for example, a discount that is incremental to the range of discounts typically given for those goods or services to that class of customer in that geographical area or market).
If the option provides a material right to the customer, the customer in effect pays the entity in advance for future goods or services and the entity recognises revenue when those future goods or services are transferred or when the option expires.
If a customer has the option to acquire an additional good or service at a price that would reflect the stand-alone selling price for that good or service, that option does not provide the customer with a material right even if the option can be exercised only by entering into a previous contract.
In those cases, the entity has made a marketing offer that it shall account for in accordance with this Standard only when the customer exercises the option to purchase the additional goods or services.
If the stand-alone selling price for a customer's option to acquire additional goods or services is not directly observable, an entity shall estimate it.
That estimate shall reflect the discount that the customer would obtain when exercising the option, adjusted for both of the following
any discount that the customer could receive without exercising the option; and
the likelihood that the option will be exercised.
If a customer has a material right to acquire future goods or services and those goods or services are similar to the original goods or services in the contract and are provided in accordance with the terms of the original contract, then an entity may, as a practical alternative to estimating the stand-alone selling price of the option, allocate the transaction price to the optional goods or services by reference to the goods or services expected to be provided and the corresponding expected consideration.
Typically, those types of options are for contract renewals.
An entity shall derecognise that contract liability (and recognise revenue) when it transfers those goods or services and, therefore, satisfies its performance obligation.
A customer's non-refundable prepayment to an entity gives the customer a right to receive a good or service in the future (and obliges the entity to stand ready to transfer a good or service).
However, customers may not exercise all of their contractual rights.
Those unexercised rights are often referred to as breakage.
If an entity expects to be entitled to a breakage amount in a contract liability, the entity shall recognise the expected breakage amount as revenue in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer.
If an entity does not expect to be entitled to a breakage amount, the entity shall recognise the expected breakage amount as revenue when the likelihood of the customer exercising its remaining rights becomes remote.
An entity shall recognise a liability (and not revenue) for any consideration received that is attributable to a customer's unexercised rights for which the entity is required to remit to another party, for example, a government entity in accordance with applicable unclaimed property laws.
Non-refundable upfront fees (and some related costs)
In some contracts, an entity charges a customer a non-refundable upfront fee at or near contract inception.
Examples include joining fees in health club membership contracts, activation fees in telecommunication contracts, setup fees in some services contracts and initial fees in some supply contracts.
To identify performance obligations in such contracts, an entity shall assess whether the fee relates to the transfer of a promised good or service.
Instead, the upfront fee is an advance payment for future goods or services and, therefore, would be recognised as revenue when those future goods or services are provided.
The revenue recognition period would extend beyond the initial contractual period if the entity grants the customer the option to renew the contract and that option provides the customer with a material right as described in paragraph B40.
If those setup activities do not satisfy a performance obligation, the entity shall disregard those activities (and related costs) when measuring progress in accordance with paragraph B19.
That is because the costs of setup activities do not depict the transfer of services to the customer.
A licence establishes a customer's rights to the intellectual property of an entity.
Licences of intellectual property may include, but are not limited to, licences of any of the following
motion pictures, music and other forms of media and entertainment;
In addition to a promise to grant a licence (or licences) to a customer, an entity may also promise to transfer other goods or services to the customer.
Examples of licences that are not distinct from other goods or services promised in the contract include the following
a licence that forms a component of a tangible good and that is integral to the functionality of the good; and
a licence that the customer can benefit from only in conjunction with a related service (such as an online service provided by the entity that enables, by granting a licence, the customer to access content).
If the promise to grant the licence is distinct from the other promised goods or services in the contract and, therefore, the promise to grant the licence is a separate performance obligation, an entity shall determine whether the licence transfers to a customer either at a point in time or over time.
In making this determination, an entity shall consider whether the nature of the entity's promise in granting the licence to a customer is to provide the customer with either
a right to access the entity's intellectual property as it exists throughout the licence period; or
a right to use the entity's intellectual property as it exists at the point in time at which the licence is granted.
Determining the nature of the entity's promise
The nature of an entity's promise in granting a licence is a promise to provide a right to access the entity's intellectual property if all of the following criteria are met
the contract requires, or the customer reasonably expects, that the entity will undertake activities that significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights (see paragraphs B59 and B59A);
Factors that may indicate that a customer could reasonably expect that an entity will undertake activities that significantly affect the intellectual property include the entity's customary business practices, published policies or specific statements.
Although not determinative, the existence of a shared economic interest (for example, a sales-based royalty) between the entity and the customer related to the intellectual property to which the customer has rights may also indicate that the customer could reasonably expect that the entity will undertake such activities.
An entity's activities significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights when either
those activities are expected to significantly change the form (for example, the design or content) or the functionality (for example, the ability to perform a function or task) of the intellectual property; or
the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual property is substantially derived from, or dependent upon, those activities.
For example, the benefit from a brand is often derived from, or dependent upon, the entity's ongoing activities that support or maintain the value of the intellectual property.
Accordingly, if the intellectual property to which the customer has rights has significant stand-alone functionality, a substantial portion of the benefit of that intellectual property is derived from that functionality.
Consequently, the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from that intellectual property would not be significantly affected by the entity's activities unless those activities significantly change its form or functionality.
Types of intellectual property that often have significant stand-alone functionality include software, biological compounds or drug formulas, and completed media content (for example, films, television shows and music recordings).
If the criteria in paragraph B58 are met, an entity shall account for the promise to grant a licence as a performance obligation satisfied over time because the customer will simultaneously receive and consume the benefit from the entity's performance of providing access to its intellectual property as the performance occurs (see paragraph 35(a)).
If the criteria in paragraph B58 are not met, the nature of an entity's promise is to provide a right to use the entity's intellectual property as that intellectual property exists (in terms of form and functionality) at the point in time at which the licence is granted to the customer.
This means that the customer can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the licence at the point in time at which the licence transfers.
An entity shall account for the promise to provide a right to use the entity's intellectual property as a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time.
However, revenue cannot be recognised for a licence that provides a right to use the entity's intellectual property before the beginning of the period during which the customer is able to use and benefit from the licence.
For example, if a software licence period begins before an entity provides (or otherwise makes available) to the customer a code that enables the customer to immediately use the software, the entity would not recognise revenue before that code has been provided (or otherwise made available).
An entity shall disregard the following factors when determining whether a licence provides a right to access the entity's intellectual property or a right to use the entity's intellectual property
the subsequent sale or usage occurs; and
the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).
The requirement for a sales-based or usage-based royalty in paragraph B63 applies when the royalty relates only to a licence of intellectual property or when a licence of intellectual property is the predominant item to which the royalty relates (for example, the licence of intellectual property may be the predominant item to which the royalty relates when the entity has a reasonable expectation that the customer would ascribe significantly more value to the licence than to the other goods or services to which the royalty relates).
When the requirement in paragraph B63A is met, revenue from a sales-based or usage-based royalty shall be recognised wholly in accordance with paragraph B63.
The repurchased asset may be the asset that was originally sold to the customer, an asset that is substantially the same as that asset, or another asset of which the asset that was originally sold is a component.
an entity's obligation to repurchase the asset (a forward);
an entity's right to repurchase the asset (a call option); and
an entity's obligation to repurchase the asset at the customer's request (a put option).
A forward or a call option
If an entity has an obligation or a right to repurchase the asset (a forward or a call option), a customer does not obtain control of the asset because the customer is limited in its ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset even though the customer may have physical possession of the asset.
Consequently, the entity shall account for the contract as either of the following
a financing arrangement in accordance with paragraph B68 if the entity can or must repurchase the asset for an amount that is equal to or more than the original selling price of the asset.
When comparing the repurchase price with the selling price, an entity shall consider the time value of money.
If the repurchase agreement is a financing arrangement, the entity shall continue to recognise the asset and also recognise a financial liability for any consideration received from the customer.
The entity shall recognise the difference between the amount of consideration received from the customer and the amount of consideration to be paid to the customer as interest and, if applicable, as processing or holding costs (for example, insurance).
If the option lapses unexercised, an entity shall derecognise the liability and recognise revenue.
If an entity has an obligation to repurchase the asset at the customer's request (a put option) at a price that is lower than the original selling price of the asset, the entity shall consider at contract inception whether the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right.
The customer's exercising of that right results in the customer effectively paying the entity consideration for the right to use a specified asset for a period of time.
Therefore, if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right, the entity shall account for the agreement as a lease in accordance with IFRS 16, unless the contract is part of a sale and leaseback transaction.
If the contract is part of a sale and leaseback transaction, the entity shall continue to recognise the asset and shall recognise a financial liability for any consideration received from the customer.
To determine whether a customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise its right, an entity shall consider various factors, including the relationship of the repurchase price to the expected market value of the asset at the date of the repurchase and the amount of time until the right expires.
For example, if the repurchase price is expected to significantly exceed the market value of the asset, this may indicate that the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the put option.
If the repurchase price of the asset is equal to or greater than the original selling price and is more than the expected market value of the asset, the contract is in effect a financing arrangement and, therefore, shall be accounted for as described in paragraph B68.
A product that has been delivered to another party may be held in a consignment arrangement if that other party has not obtained control of the product.
Accordingly, an entity shall not recognise revenue upon delivery of a product to another party if the delivered product is held on consignment.
Indicators that an arrangement is a consignment arrangement include, but are not limited to, the following
the product is controlled by the entity until a specified event occurs, such as the sale of the product to a customer of the dealer or until a specified period expires;
the dealer does not have an unconditional obligation to pay for the product (although it might be required to pay a deposit).
For example, a customer may request an entity to enter into such a contract because of the customer's lack of available space for the product or because of delays in the customer's production schedules.
For some contracts, control is transferred either when the product is delivered to the customer's site or when the product is shipped, depending on the terms of the contract (including delivery and shipping terms).
However, for some contracts, a customer may obtain control of a product even though that product remains in an entity's physical possession.
In that case, the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the product even though it has decided not to exercise its right to take physical possession of that product.
Consequently, the entity does not control the product.
Instead, the entity provides custodial services to the customer over the customer's asset.
the reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement must be substantive (for example, the customer has requested the arrangement);
the product must be identified separately as belonging to the customer;
the product currently must be ready for physical transfer to the customer; and
the entity cannot have the ability to use the product or to direct it to another customer.
Customer acceptance clauses allow a customer to cancel a contract or require an entity to take remedial action if a good or service does not meet agreed-upon specifications.
An entity shall consider such clauses when evaluating when a customer obtains control of a good or service.
If an entity can objectively determine that control of a good or service has been transferred to the customer in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then customer acceptance is a formality that would not affect the entity's determination of when the customer has obtained control of the good or service.
For example, if the customer acceptance clause is based on meeting specified size and weight characteristics, an entity would be able to determine whether those criteria have been met before receiving confirmation of the customer's acceptance.
The entity's experience with contracts for similar goods or services may provide evidence that a good or service provided to the customer is in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract.
If revenue is recognised before customer acceptance, the entity still must consider whether there are any remaining performance obligations (for example, installation of equipment) and evaluate whether to account for them separately.
However, if an entity cannot objectively determine that the good or service provided to the customer is in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then the entity would not be able to conclude that the customer has obtained control until the entity receives the customer's acceptance.
That is because in that circumstance the entity cannot determine that the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service.
If an entity delivers products to a customer for trial or evaluation purposes and the customer is not committed to pay any consideration until the trial period lapses, control of the product is not transferred to the customer until either the customer accepts the product or the trial period lapses.
Consequently, the extent to which an entity's revenue is disaggregated for the purposes of this disclosure depends on the facts and circumstances that pertain to the entity's contracts with customers.
information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for evaluating the financial performance of operating segments; and
Examples of categories that might be appropriate include, but are not limited to, all of the following
type of good or service (for example, major product lines);
geographical region (for example, country or region);
market or type of customer (for example, government and non-government customers);
type of contract (for example, fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts);
contract duration (for example, short-term and long-term contracts);
timing of transfer of goods or services (for example, revenue from goods or services transferred to customers at a point in time and revenue from goods or services transferred over time); and
sales channels (for example, goods sold directly to consumers and goods sold through intermediaries).
For the purposes of the transition requirements in paragraphs C3–C8A
the date of initial application is the start of the reporting period in which an entity first applies this Standard; and
An entity may also present this information for the current period or for earlier comparative periods, but is not required to do so.
for completed contracts, an entity need not restate contracts that
are completed contracts at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
for completed contracts that have variable consideration, an entity may use the transaction price at the date the contract was completed rather than estimating variable consideration amounts in the comparative reporting periods.
Instead, an entity shall reflect the aggregate effect of all of the modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when
identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations;
determining the transaction price; and
(iii) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations.
For any of the practical expedients in paragraph C5 that an entity uses, the entity shall apply that expedient consistently to all contracts within all reporting periods presented.
In addition, the entity shall disclose all of the following information
the expedients that have been used; and
to the extent reasonably possible, a qualitative assessment of the estimated effect of applying each of those expedients.
An entity applying this Standard retrospectively in accordance with paragraph C3(b) may also use the practical expedient described in paragraph C5(c), either
for all contract modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented; or
for all contract modifications that occur before the date of initial application.
If an entity uses this practical expedient, the entity shall apply the expedient consistently to all contracts and disclose the information required by paragraph C6.
For reporting periods that include the date of initial application, an entity shall provide both of the following additional disclosures if this Standard is applied retrospectively in accordance with paragraph C3(b)
an explanation of the reasons for significant changes identified in C8(a).
This Standard supersedes the following Standards
CONSTRAINING ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION
THE EXISTENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT IN THE CONTRACT
ALLOCATING THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
In addition, the following requirements are illustrated in these examples
The building is located in an area where new restaurants face high levels of competition and the customer has little experience in the restaurant industry.
The financing arrangement is provided on a non-recourse basis, which means that if the customer defaults, the entity can repossess the building, but cannot seek further compensation from the customer, even if the collateral does not cover the full value of the amount owed.
The customer obtains control of the building at contract inception.
In reaching this conclusion, the entity observes that the customer's ability and intention to pay may be in doubt because of the following factors
the customer intends to repay the loan (which has a significant balance) primarily from income derived from its restaurant business (which is a business facing significant risks because of high competition in the industry and the customer's limited experience);
the customer lacks other income or assets that could be used to repay the loan; and
the customer's liability under the loan is limited because the loan is non-recourse.
Thus, the entity expects that it will not be able to collect from the customer the full amount of the promised consideration.
Based on the assessment of the facts and circumstances, the entity determines that it expects to provide a price concession and accept a lower amount of consideration from the customer.
An entity, a hospital, provides medical services to an uninsured patient in the emergency room.
The entity has not previously provided medical services to this patient but is required by law to provide medical services to all emergency room patients.
Because of the patient's condition upon arrival at the hospital, the entity provides the services immediately and, therefore, before the entity can determine whether the patient is committed to perform its obligations under the contract in exchange for the medical services provided.
After providing services, the entity obtains additional information about the patient including a review of the services provided, standard rates for such services and the patient's ability and intention to pay the entity for the services provided.
The entity also reviews the patient's information and to be consistent with its policies designates the patient to a customer class based on the entity's assessment of the patient's ability and intention to pay.
The entity reviews its historical cash collections from this customer class and other relevant information about the patient.
An entity licences a patent to a customer in exchange for a usage-based royalty.
The customer's current access to credit and available cash on hand are limited.
The entity therefore concludes that it is unlikely that the customer will be able to make any further royalty payments for ongoing usage of the entity's patent.
Accordingly, the entity does not recognise any further revenue associated with the customer's future usage of its patent.
The entity transfers control of each product at a point in time.
The entity includes its estimate of variable consideration in the transaction price because it concludes that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved.
The entity accounts for the modification as if it were the termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract.
This is because the remaining Products Y and Z are distinct from Product X, which had transferred to the customer before the modification, and the promised consideration for the additional Product Z does not represent its stand-alone selling price.
The entity concludes that the change in estimate of the variable consideration can be included in the transaction price, because it is highly probable that a significant reversal in cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved.
Because Product Y had not transferred to the customer before the contract modification, the change in the transaction price that is attributable to Product Y is allocated to the remaining performance obligations at the time of the contract modification.
At the date of the modification, the entity assesses the remaining services to be provided and concludes that they are distinct.
At the inception of the contract, the entity expects the following
Completion of the building is highly susceptible to factors outside the entity's influence, including weather and regulatory approvals.
In addition, the entity has limited experience with similar types of contracts.
Consequently, the entity accounts for the contract modification as if it were part of the original contract (in accordance with paragraph 21(b) of IFRS 15).
An entity enters into a contract with a customer to construct a building on customer-owned land.
The contract specifically identifies any delay (including force majeure) in the entity's access to customer-owned land as an event that entitles the entity to compensation that is equal to actual costs incurred as a direct result of the delay.
The entity is able to demonstrate that the specific direct costs were incurred as a result of the delay in accordance with the terms of the contract and prepares a claim.
The customer initially disagreed with the entity's claim.
The entity assesses the legal basis of the claim and determines, on the basis of the underlying contractual terms, that it has enforceable rights.
The modification does not result in any additional goods and services being provided to the customer.
In addition, all of the remaining goods and services after the modification are not distinct and form part of a single performance obligation.
An entity, a contractor, enters into a contract to build a hospital for a customer.
The entity is responsible for the overall management of the project and identifies various promised goods and services, including engineering, site clearance, foundation, procurement, construction of the structure, piping and wiring, installation of equipment and finishing.
In addition, the customer could generate economic benefit from the individual goods and services by using, consuming, selling or holding those goods or services.
The entity accounts for all of the goods and services in the contract as a single performance obligation.
An entity enters into a contract with a customer that will result in the delivery of multiple units of a highly complex, specialised device.
The terms of the contract require the entity to establish a manufacturing process in order to produce the contracted units.
The specifications are unique to the customer, based on a custom design that is owned by the customer and that were developed under the terms of a separate contract that is not part of the current negotiated exchange.
The entity is responsible for the overall management of the contract, which requires the performance and integration of various activities including procurement of materials, identifying and managing subcontractors, and performing manufacturing, assembly and testing.
This is because each unit can function independently of the other units.
The entity observes that the nature of its promise is to establish and provide a service of producing the full complement of devices for which the customer has contracted in accordance with the customer's specifications.
In this case, the manufacturing process provided by the entity is specific to its contract with the customer.
The entity accounts for all of the goods and services promised in the contract as a single performance obligation.
The entity sells the licence, installation service and technical support separately.
The installation service includes changing the web screen for each type of user (for example, marketing, inventory management and information technology).
The installation service is routinely performed by other entities and does not significantly modify the software.
The software remains functional without the updates and the technical support.
The entity observes that the software is delivered before the other goods and services and remains functional without the updates and the technical support.
The customer can benefit from the updates together with the software licence transferred at the start of the contract.
In reaching this determination, the entity considers that, although it integrates the software into the customer's system, the installation services do not significantly affect the customer's ability to use and benefit from the software licence because the installation services are routine and can be obtained from alternative providers.
The software updates do not significantly affect the customer's ability to use and benefit from the software licence during the licence period.
Lastly, the entity concludes that the software and the services do not significantly affect each other and, therefore, are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated, because the entity would be able to fulfil its promise to transfer the initial software licence independently from its promise to subsequently provide the installation service, software updates or technical support.
The promised goods and services are the same as in Case A, except that the contract specifies that, as part of the installation service, the software is to be substantially customised to add significant new functionality to enable the software to interface with other customised software applications used by the customer.
The customised installation service can be provided by other entities.
The entity first assesses whether the criterion in paragraph 27(a) has been met.
For the same reasons as in Case A, the entity determines that the software licence, installation, software updates and technical support each meet that criterion.
The entity observes that the terms of the contract result in a promise to provide a significant service of integrating the licenced software into the existing software system by performing a customised installation service as specified in the contract.
In other words, the entity is using the licence and the customised installation service as inputs to produce the combined output (ie a functional and integrated software system) specified in the contract (see paragraph 29(a) of IFRS 15).
The software is significantly modified and customised by the service (see paragraph 29(b) of IFRS 15).
Thus, the software licence and the customised installation service are not distinct.
On the basis of the same analysis as in Case A, the entity concludes that the software updates and technical support are distinct from the other promises in the contract.
software customisation (which comprises the licence for the software and the customised installation service);
Case C — Promises are separately identifiable (installation)
An entity contracts with a customer to sell a piece of equipment and installation services.
The equipment is operational without any customisation or modification.
The installation required is not complex and is capable of being performed by several alternative service providers.
The customer can benefit from the equipment on its own, by using it or reselling it for an amount greater than scrap value, or together with other readily available resources (for example, installation services available from alternative providers).
The customer also can benefit from the installation services together with other resources that the customer will already have obtained from the entity (ie the equipment).
The entity further determines that its promises to transfer the equipment and to provide the installation services are each separately identifiable (in accordance with paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15).
The entity has not promised to combine the equipment and the installation services in a way that would transform them into a combined output.
Because the equipment and the installation services do not each significantly affect the other, they are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated.
Assume the same facts as in Case C, except that the customer is contractually required to use the entity's installation services.
The contractual requirement to use the entity's installation services does not change the evaluation of whether the promised goods and services are distinct in this case.
This is because the contractual requirement to use the entity's installation services does not change the characteristics of the goods or services themselves, nor does it change the entity's promises to the customer.
The entity's analysis in this regard is consistent with that in Case C.
The consumables are produced only by the entity, but are sold separately by the entity.
The entity determines that the customer can benefit from the equipment together with the readily available consumables.
The customer can benefit from the consumables that will be delivered under the contract together with the delivered equipment that is transferred to the customer initially under the contract.
In determining that the equipment and the consumables are not inputs to a combined item in this contract, the entity considers that it is not providing a significant integration service that transforms the equipment and consumables into a combined output.
In addition, neither the equipment nor the consumables are significantly customised or modified by the other.
Lastly, the entity concludes that the equipment and the consumables are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated because they do not significantly affect each other.
This is because the entity would be able to fulfil each of its promises in the contract independently of the other.
That is, the entity would be able to fulfil its promise to transfer the equipment even if the customer did not purchase any consumables and would be able to fulfil its promise to provide the consumables, even if the customer acquired the equipment separately.
An entity, a manufacturer, sells a product to a distributor (ie its customer) who will then resell it to an end customer.
In the contract with the distributor, the entity promises to provide maintenance services for no additional consideration (ie 'free') to any party (ie the end customer) that purchases the product from the distributor.
The entity outsources the performance of the maintenance services to the distributor and pays the distributor an agreed-upon amount for providing those services on the entity's behalf.
If the end customer does not use the maintenance services, the entity is not obliged to pay the distributor.
The promise of maintenance services is a promise to transfer goods or services in the future and is part of the negotiated exchange between the entity and the distributor.
The entity regularly sells the product on a stand-alone basis, which indicates that the customer can benefit from the product on its own.
The product and the maintenance services are not inputs to a combined item in the contract.
The entity is not providing a significant integration service because the presence of the product and the services together in this contract do not result in any additional or combined functionality.
In addition, neither the product nor the services modify or customise the other.
The entity has historically provided maintenance services for no additional consideration (ie 'free') to end customers that purchase the entity's product from the distributor.
The entity does not explicitly promise maintenance services during negotiations with the distributor and the final contract between the entity and the distributor does not specify terms or conditions for those services.
However, on the basis of its customary business practice, the entity determines at contract inception that it has made an implicit promise to provide maintenance services as part of the negotiated exchange with the distributor.
Consequently, the entity assesses whether the promise of maintenance services is a performance obligation.
For the same reasons as in Case A, the entity determines that the product and maintenance services are separate performance obligations.
In the contract with the distributor, the entity does not promise to provide any maintenance services.
In addition, the entity typically does not provide maintenance services and, therefore, the entity's customary business practices, published policies and specific statements at the time of entering into the contract have not created an implicit promise to provide goods or services to its customers.
The entity transfers control of the product to the distributor and, therefore, the contract is completed.
However, before the sale to the end customer, the entity makes an offer to provide maintenance services to any party that purchases the product from the distributor for no additional promised consideration.
The promise of maintenance is not included in the contract between the entity and the distributor at contract inception.
Consequently, the entity does not identify the promise to provide maintenance services as a performance obligation.
Although the maintenance services are not a promised service in the current contract, in future contracts with customers the entity would assess whether it has created a business practice resulting in an implied promise to provide maintenance services.
The fact that another entity would not need to re-perform payroll processing services for the service that the entity has provided to date also demonstrates that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the entity's performance as the entity performs.
An entity enters into a contract with a customer to provide a consulting service that results in the entity providing a professional opinion to the customer.
The professional opinion relates to facts and circumstances that are specific to the customer.
If the entity were to be unable to satisfy its obligation and the customer hired another consulting firm to provide the opinion, the other consulting firm would need to substantially re-perform the work that the entity had completed to date, because the other consulting firm would not have the benefit of any work in progress performed by the entity.
The nature of the professional opinion is such that the customer will receive the benefits of the entity's performance only when the customer receives the professional opinion.
Therefore, there is a practical limitation on the entity's ability to readily direct the asset to another customer.
An entity enters into a contract with a customer, a government agency, to build a specialised satellite.
The entity builds satellites for various customers, such as governments and commercial entities.
The design and construction of each satellite differ substantially, on the basis of each customer's needs and the type of technology that is incorporated into the satellite.
As part of that assessment, the entity considers whether the satellite in its completed state will have an alternative use to the entity.
Although the contract does not preclude the entity from directing the completed satellite to another customer, the entity would incur significant costs to rework the design and function of the satellite to direct that asset to another customer.
This condition is not illustrated in this example.
An entity enters into a contract with a customer to build an item of equipment.
The payments are non-refundable unless the entity fails to perform as promised.
If the customer terminates the contract, the entity is entitled only to retain any progress payments received from the customer.
The entity has no further rights to compensation from the customer.
Even though the payments made by the customer are non-refundable, the cumulative amount of those payments is not expected, at all times throughout the contract, to at least correspond to the amount that would be necessary to compensate the entity for performance completed to date.
This is because at various times during construction the cumulative amount of consideration paid by the customer might be less than the selling price of the partially completed item of equipment at that time.
Consequently, the entity does not have a right to payment for performance completed to date.
Accordingly, the entity does not need to assess whether the equipment would have an alternative use to the entity.
An entity is developing a multi-unit residential complex.
A customer enters into a binding sales contract with the entity for a specified unit that is under construction.
Each unit has a similar floor plan and is of a similar size, but other attributes of the units are different (for example, the location of the unit within the complex).
The customer pays a deposit upon entering into the contract and the deposit is refundable only if the entity fails to complete construction of the unit in accordance with the contract.
The remainder of the contract price is payable on completion of the contract when the customer obtains physical possession of the unit.
If the customer defaults on the contract before completion of the unit, the entity only has the right to retain the deposit.
The entity determines that it does not have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date because, until construction of the unit is complete, the entity only has a right to the deposit paid by the customer.
The customer pays a non-refundable deposit upon entering into the contract and will make progress payments during construction of the unit.
The contract has substantive terms that preclude the entity from being able to direct the unit to another customer.
In addition, the customer does not have the right to terminate the contract unless the entity fails to perform as promised.
If the customer defaults on its obligations by failing to make the promised progress payments as and when they are due, the entity would have a right to all of the consideration promised in the contract if it completes the construction of the unit.
The courts have previously upheld similar rights that entitle developers to require the customer to perform, subject to the entity meeting its obligations under the contract.
The entity determines that the asset (unit) created by the entity's performance does not have an alternative use to the entity because the contract precludes the entity from transferring the specified unit to another customer.
The entity does not consider the possibility of a contract termination in assessing whether the entity is able to direct the asset to another customer.
This is because if the customer were to default on its obligations, the entity would have an enforceable right to all of the consideration promised under the contract if it continues to perform as promised.
Therefore, the terms of the contract and the practices in the legal jurisdiction indicate that there is a right to payment for performance completed to date.
In the construction of a multi-unit residential complex, the entity may have many contracts with individual customers for the construction of individual units within the complex.
The entity would account for each contract separately.
However, depending on the nature of the construction, the entity's performance in undertaking the initial construction works (ie the foundation and the basic structure), as well as the construction of common areas, may need to be reflected when measuring its progress towards complete satisfaction of its performance obligations in each contract.
Notwithstanding that the entity could cancel the contract (in which case the customer's obligation to the entity would be limited to transferring control of the partially completed asset to the entity and paying the penalty prescribed), the entity has a right to payment for performance completed to date because the entity could also choose to enforce its rights to full payment under the contract.
The entity determines that its promise to the customer is to provide a service of making the health clubs available for the customer to use as and when the customer wishes.
This is because the extent to which the customer uses the health clubs does not affect the amount of the remaining goods and services to which the customer is entitled.
The entity concludes that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the entity's performance as it performs by making the health clubs available.
The promised refurbishment service, including the installation of elevators, is a single performance obligation satisfied over time.
The entity determines that it acts as a principal in accordance with paragraphs B34–B38 of IFRS 15, because it obtains control of the elevators before they are transferred to the customer.
A summary of the transaction price and expected costs is as follows
The entity uses an input method based on costs incurred to measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.
The entity is not involved in designing or manufacturing the elevators.
The entity concludes that including the costs to procure the elevators in the measure of progress would overstate the extent of the entity's performance.
An entity enters into a contract with a customer to build a customised asset.
The promise to transfer the asset is a performance obligation that is satisfied over time.
This is because it is the method that the entity expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled.
the entity decides to use the most likely amount to estimate the variable consideration associated with the incentive bonus.
Cash is received when control of a product transfers.
Because the contract allows a customer to return the products, the consideration received from the customer is variable.
The entity estimates that the costs of recovering the products will be immaterial and expects that the returned products can be resold at a profit.
Payment from the customer is due when the customer sells the products to the end customers.
On the basis of its past practices and to maintain its relationship with the customer, the entity anticipates granting a price concession to its customer because this will enable the customer to discount the product and thereby move the product through the distribution chain.
The entity has significant experience selling this and similar products.
In addition, despite some uncertainty resulting from factors outside its influence, based on its current market estimates, the entity expects the price to be resolved within a short time frame.
The entity's actual results have been consistent with then-current market information in previous, similar transactions.
The entity determines that it has significant experience with this product and with the purchasing pattern of the entity.
Consequently, both the management fee and the performance fee in the contract are variable consideration.
The entity accounts for the services as a single performance obligation in accordance with paragraph 22(b) of IFRS 15, because it is providing a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer (the services transfer to the customer over time and use the same method to measure progress — that is, a time-based measure of progress).
The entity observes that the promised consideration is dependent on the market and thus is highly susceptible to factors outside the entity's influence.
In addition, the incentive fee has a large number and a broad range of possible consideration amounts.
The entity also observes that although it has experience with similar contracts, that experience is of little predictive value in determining the future performance of the market.
Therefore, at contract inception, the entity cannot conclude that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognised would not occur if the entity included its estimate of the management fee or the incentive fee in the transaction price.
At each reporting date, the entity updates its estimate of the transaction price.
The customer obtains control of the product at contract inception.
The product is new and the entity has no relevant historical evidence of product returns or other available market evidence.
The entity does not recognise revenue when control of the product transfers to the customer.
The entity evaluates the rate and concludes that it is commensurate with the rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the entity and its customer at contract inception.
Asset for right to recover product to be returned
Asset for product to be returned
In determining the effective interest rate in accordance with IFRS 9, the entity would consider the remaining contractual term.
The entity concludes that the contract does not include a significant financing component.
The withholding of a specified percentage of each milestone payment is intended to protect the customer from the contractor failing to adequately complete its obligations under the contract.
An entity enters into a contract with a customer to sell equipment.
Control of the equipment transfers to the customer when the contract is signed.
This amount is recognised as revenue and as a loan receivable when control of the equipment transfers to the customer.
The entity recognises revenue and a loan receivable for that amount.
An entity enters into a contract with a customer to sell an asset.
The entity concludes that the contract contains a significant financing component because of the length of time between when the customer pays for the asset and when the entity transfers the asset to the customer, as well as the prevailing interest rates in the market.
The following journal entries illustrate how the entity would account for the significant financing component
recognise revenue for the transfer of the asset
The customer purchases this support service at the time of buying the product.
To determine whether there is a significant financing component in the contract, the entity considers the nature of the service being offered and the purpose of the payment terms.
The entity charges a single upfront amount, not with the primary purpose of obtaining financing from the customer but, instead, to maximise profitability, taking into consideration the risks associated with providing the service.
In assessing the requirements in paragraph 62(c) of IFRS 15, the entity determines that the payment terms were structured primarily for reasons other than the provision of finance to the entity.
As a result of its analysis, the entity concludes that there is not a significant financing component.
In addition, the following requirements are illustrated in this example
This is because the entity is providing a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer (the services transfer to the customer over time and use the same method to measure progress — that is, a time-based measure of progress).
The entity does not reflect any subsequent changes in the fair value of the shares received (or receivable) in revenue.
The entity will satisfy the performance obligations for each of the products at different points in time.
The entity regularly sells Product A separately and therefore the stand-alone selling price is directly observable.
The stand-alone selling prices of Products B and C are not directly observable.
Because the stand-alone selling prices for Products B and C are not directly observable, the entity must estimate them.
The entity estimates the stand-alone selling prices as follows
Adjusted market assessment approach (see paragraph 79(a) of IFRS 15)
The customer receives a discount for purchasing the bundle of goods because the sum of the stand-alone selling prices (CU150) exceeds the promised consideration (CU100).
An entity regularly sells Products A, B and C individually, thereby establishing the following stand-alone selling prices
If the entity transfers control of Products B and C at the same point in time, then the entity could, as a practical matter, account for the transfer of those products as a single performance obligation.
Consequently, the entity decides to estimate the stand-alone selling price of Product D using the residual approach.
Residual approach (see paragraph 79(c) of IFRS 15)
Consequently, the entity reviews its observable data, including sales and margin reports, to estimate the stand-alone selling price of Product D using another suitable method.
Upon the transfer of Licence Y, the entity does not recognise revenue because the consideration allocated to Licence Y is in the form of a sales-based royalty.
Therefore, in accordance with paragraph B63 of IFRS 15, the entity recognises revenue for the sales-based royalty when those subsequent sales occur.
The entity also allocates the consideration related to the sales-based royalty on a relative stand-alone selling price basis.
An entity, a provider of consulting services, wins a competitive bid to provide consulting services to a new customer.
The entity incurred the following costs to obtain the contract
External legal fees for due diligence
Travel costs to deliver proposal
The amounts are discretionary and are based on other factors, including the profitability of the entity and the individuals' performance.
The bonuses are not directly attributable to identifiable contracts.
The entity observes that the external legal fees and travel costs would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained.
Before providing the services, the entity designs and builds a technology platform for the entity's internal use that interfaces with the customer's systems.
That platform is not transferred to the customer, but will be used to deliver services to the customer.
The initial costs incurred to set up the technology platform are as follows
Migration and testing of data centre
The initial setup costs relate primarily to activities to fulfil the contract but do not transfer goods or services to the customer.
The entity accounts for the initial setup costs as follows
The following journal entries illustrate how the entity accounts for the contract
The same facts as in Case A apply to Case B except that the contract is non-cancellable.
Consequently, the entity does not have a right to consideration that is unconditional (a receivable) until both Products A and B are transferred to the customer.
The entity recognises revenue for each respective performance obligation when control of the product transfers to the customer.
The entity satisfies the performance obligation to transfer Product B and to recognise the unconditional right to consideration
Consideration is due when control of the products transfer to the customer.
Major goods / service lines
Goods transferred at a point in time
The entity discloses the amount of the transaction price that has not yet been recognised as revenue in a table with quantitative time bands that illustrates when the entity expects to recognise the amount as revenue.
The information for Contract B included in the overall disclosure is as follows
The entity also includes a qualitative discussion about any significant variable consideration that is not included in the disclosure.
The information for Contract C included in the overall disclosure is as follows
That part of the performance bonus was excluded from the transaction price in accordance with the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration.
The construction of the building is a single performance obligation that the entity satisfies over time.
The entity also discloses an explanation of when the entity expects to recognise that amount as revenue.
The explanation can be disclosed either on a quantitative basis using time bands that are most appropriate for the duration of the remaining performance obligation or by providing a qualitative explanation.
Because the entity is uncertain about the timing of revenue recognition, the entity discloses this information qualitatively as follows
An entity, a manufacturer, provides its customer with a warranty with the purchase of a product.
The entity assesses the goods and services in the contract to determine whether they are distinct and therefore give rise to separate performance obligations.
The entity regularly sells the product separately without the training services.
The entity does not provide a significant service of integrating the training services with the product (see paragraph 29(a) of IFRS 15).
The training services and product do not significantly modify or customise each other (see paragraph 29(b) of IFRS 15).
The product and the training services are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated (see paragraph 29(c) of IFRS 15).
The entity would be able to fulfil its promise to transfer the product independently of its efforts to subsequently provide the training services, and would be able to provide training services to any customer that had previously acquired its product.
Consequently, the entity concludes that its promise to transfer the product and its promise to provide training services are not inputs to a combined item, and, therefore, are each separately identifiable.
The entity concludes, in accordance with paragraphs B28–B33 of IFRS 15, that the warranty does not provide the customer with a good or service in addition to that assurance and, therefore, the entity does not account for it as a performance obligation.
The entity's website facilitates payment between the supplier and the customer at prices that are set by the supplier.
The entity requires payment from customers before orders are processed and all orders are non-refundable.
The entity has no further obligations to the customer after arranging for the products to be provided to the customer.
Accordingly, the entity observes that the specified goods to be provided to customers that use the website are the goods provided by the suppliers, and no other goods or services are promised to customers by the entity.
The entity does not at any time have the ability to direct the use of the goods transferred to customers.
For example, it cannot direct the goods to parties other than the customer or prevent the supplier from transferring those goods to the customer.
The entity does not control the suppliers' inventory of goods used to fulfil the orders placed by customers using the website.
The entity concludes that these indicators provide further evidence that it does not control the specified goods before they are transferred to the customers
the supplier is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods to the customer.
The entity is neither obliged to provide the goods if the supplier fails to transfer the goods to the customer, nor responsible for the acceptability of the goods.
the entity does not take inventory risk at any time before or after the goods are transferred to the customer.
The entity does not commit itself to obtain the goods from the supplier before the goods are purchased by the customer, and does not accept responsibility for any damaged or returned goods.
the entity does not have discretion in establishing prices for the supplier's goods.
The sales price is set by the supplier.
Consequently, the entity concludes that it is an agent and its performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of goods by the supplier.
When the entity satisfies its promise to arrange for the goods to be provided by the supplier to the customer (which, in this example, is when goods are purchased by the customer), the entity recognises revenue in the amount of the commission to which it is entitled.
An entity enters into a contract with a customer for equipment with unique specifications.
The entity and the customer develop the specifications for the equipment, which the entity communicates to a supplier that the entity contracts with to manufacture the equipment.
The entity also arranges to have the supplier deliver the equipment directly to the customer.
Upon delivery of the equipment to the customer, the terms of the contract require the entity to pay the supplier the price agreed to by the entity and the supplier for manufacturing the equipment.
The entity's profit is based on the difference between the sales price negotiated with the customer and the price charged by the supplier.
The contract between the entity and the customer requires the customer to seek remedies for defects in the equipment from the supplier under the supplier's warranty.
However, the entity is responsible for any corrections to the equipment required resulting from errors in specifications.
Although the entity has subcontracted the manufacturing of the equipment to the supplier, the entity concludes that the design and manufacturing of the equipment are not distinct, because they are not separately identifiable (ie there is a single performance obligation).
In addition, those activities are highly interrelated.
If necessary modifications to the specifications are identified as the equipment is manufactured, the entity is responsible for developing and communicating revisions to the supplier and for ensuring that any associated rework required conforms with the revised specifications.
Accordingly, the entity identifies the specified good to be provided to the customer as the specialised equipment.
The entity provides the significant integration service necessary to produce the specialised equipment and, therefore, controls the specialised equipment before it is transferred to the customer.
The entity directs the use of the supplier's manufacturing service as an input in creating the combined output that is the specialised equipment.
The entity also obtains the remaining benefits from the specialised equipment by being entitled to the consideration in the contract from the customer.
Thus, the entity concludes that it is a principal in the transaction.
The entity recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it is entitled from the customer in exchange for the specialised equipment.
The entity and the customer define and agree on the scope of the services and negotiate the price.
The entity is responsible for ensuring that the services are performed in accordance with the terms and conditions in the contract.
The payment terms in the contracts with the service providers are generally aligned with the payment terms in the entity's contracts with customers.
However, the entity is obliged to pay the service provider even if the customer fails to pay.
IE238C To determine whether the entity is a principal or an agent, the entity identifies the specified good or service to be provided to the customer and assesses whether it controls that good or service before the good or service is transferred to the customer.
While the entity obtains a right to office maintenance services from the service provider after entering into the contract with the customer, that right is not transferred to the customer.
That is, the entity retains the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from, that right.
For example, the entity can decide whether to direct the service provider to provide the office maintenance services for that customer, or for another customer, or at its own facilities.
The customer does not have a right to direct the service provider to perform services that the entity has not agreed to provide.
Therefore, the right to office maintenance services obtained by the entity from the service provider is not the specified good or service in its contract with the customer.
The entity obtains control of a right to office maintenance services after entering into the contract with the customer but before those services are provided to the customer.
The terms of the entity's contract with the service provider give the entity the ability to direct the service provider to provide the specified services on the entity's behalf (see paragraph B35A(b)).
the entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide office maintenance services.
the entity has discretion in setting the price for the services to the customer.
Thus, the entity has mitigated inventory risk with respect to the office maintenance services.
Nonetheless, the entity concludes that it controls the office maintenance services before they are provided to the customer on the basis of the evidence in paragraph IE238E.
An entity negotiates with major airlines to purchase tickets at reduced rates compared with the price of tickets sold directly by the airlines to the public.
The entity agrees to buy a specific number of tickets and must pay for those tickets regardless of whether it is able to resell them.
The reduced rate paid by the entity for each ticket purchased is negotiated and agreed in advance.
The entity determines the prices at which the airline tickets will be sold to its customers.
The entity sells the tickets and collects the consideration from customers when the tickets are purchased.
The entity also assists the customers in resolving complaints with the service provided by the airlines.
However, each airline is responsible for fulfilling obligations associated with the ticket, including remedies to a customer for dissatisfaction with the service.
Consequently, the entity determines that the specified good or service to be provided to its customer is that right (to a seat on a specific flight) that the entity controls.
The entity observes that no other goods or services are promised to the customer.
The entity also has the ability to obtain the remaining benefits from that right by either reselling the ticket and obtaining all of the proceeds from the sale or, alternatively, using the ticket itself.
The entity has inventory risk with respect to the ticket because the entity committed itself to obtain the ticket from the airline before obtaining a contract with a customer to purchase the ticket.
This is because the entity is obliged to pay the airline for that right regardless of whether it is able to obtain a customer to resell the ticket to or whether it can obtain a favourable price for the ticket.
The entity also establishes the price that the customer will pay for the specified ticket.
Thus, the entity concludes that it is a principal in the transactions with customers.
The entity recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the tickets transferred to the customers.
An entity sells vouchers that entitle customers to future meals at specified restaurants.
The entity sells the vouchers through its website and the vouchers are non-refundable.
The entity and the restaurants jointly determine the prices at which the vouchers will be sold to customers.
The entity also assists the customers in resolving complaints about the meals and has a buyer satisfaction programme.
However, the restaurant is responsible for fulfilling obligations associated with the voucher, including remedies to a customer for dissatisfaction with the service.
To determine whether the entity is a principal or an agent, the entity identifies the specified good or service to be provided to the customer and assesses whether it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer.
Therefore, the entity observes that the specified good or service to be provided to the customer is the right to a meal (in the form of a voucher) at a specified restaurant or restaurants, which the customer purchases and then can use itself or transfer to another person.
The entity also observes that no other goods or services (other than the vouchers) are promised to the customers.
IE247B The entity concludes that it does not control the voucher (right to a meal) at any time.
In reaching this conclusion, the entity principally considers the following
the vouchers are created only at the time that they are transferred to the customers and, thus, do not exist before that transfer.
Therefore, the entity does not at any time have the ability to direct the use of the vouchers, or obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the vouchers, before they are transferred to customers.
the entity neither purchases, nor commits itself to purchase, vouchers before they are sold to customers.
The entity also has no responsibility to accept any returned vouchers.
Thus, the entity concludes that it is an agent with respect to the vouchers.
IE248A An entity sells services to assist its customers in more effectively targeting potential recruits for open job positions.
The entity performs several services itself, such as interviewing candidates and performing background checks.
The database provider sets the price charged to the customer for the licence, and is responsible for providing technical support and credits to which the customer may be entitled for service down time or other technical issues.
IE248B To determine whether the entity is a principal or an agent, the entity identifies the specified goods or services to be provided to the customer, and assesses whether it controls those goods or services before they are transferred to the customer.
IE248D The entity concludes that it does not control the access to the database before it is provided to the customer.
The entity does not at any time have the ability to direct the use of the licence because the customer contracts for the licence directly with the database provider.
The entity concludes that these indicators provide further evidence that it does not control access to the database before that access is provided to the customer
the entity is not responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the database access service.
the entity does not have inventory risk because it does not purchase, or commit itself to purchase, the database access before the customer contracts for database access directly with the database provider.
the entity does not have discretion in setting the price for the database access with the customer because the database provider sets that price.
In contrast, the entity concludes that it is the principal in relation to the recruitment services because the entity performs those services itself and no other party is involved in providing those services to the customer.
That example may not apply to all customer loyalty arrangements because the terms and conditions may differ.
The prices for those services are equal to their stand-alone selling prices.
The entity determines that the promises to provide the handset and network service are each separate performance obligations.
Consequently, the entity concludes that the promise to provide the option is a performance obligation.
The renewal option is for a continuation of maintenance services and those services are provided in accordance with the terms of the existing contract.
The entity also determines that recognising revenue on the basis of costs incurred relative to the total expected costs depicts the transfer of services to the customer.
Accordingly, the pattern of revenue recognition expected at contract inception for each contract is as follows
Expected costs adjusted for likelihood of contract renewal
If the actual number of contract renewals was different than what the entity expected, the entity would update the transaction price and the revenue recognised accordingly.
The points provide a material right to customers that they would not receive without entering into a contract.
Consequently, the entity concludes that the promise to provide points to the customer is a performance obligation.
The entity's contracts have standard terms that are the same for all customers.
The contract requires the customer to pay an upfront fee to set up the customer on the entity's systems and processes.
The fee is a nominal amount and is non-refundable.
The entity's setup activities do not transfer a good or service to the customer and, therefore, do not give rise to a performance obligation.
The upfront fee is, in effect, an advance payment for the future transaction processing services.
These examples also illustrate other requirements as follows
The entity also observes that it does not have any contractual or implied obligations (independent of the updates and technical support) to undertake activities that will change the functionality of the software during the licence period.
The entity observes that the software remains functional without the updates and the technical support and, therefore, the ability of the customer to obtain the benefits of the software is not substantially derived from, or dependent on, the entity's ongoing activities.
The entity therefore determines that the contract does not require, and the customer does not reasonably expect, the entity to undertake activities that significantly affect the software (independent of the updates and technical support).
The entity further concludes that the nature of the entity's promise in transferring the licence is to provide a right to use the entity's intellectual property as it exists at a point in time.
The contract also specifies that the customer will obtain any updates to that intellectual property for new designs or production processes that may be developed by the entity.
The updates are integral to the customer's ability to derive benefit from the licence during the licence period, because the intellectual property is used in an industry in which technologies change rapidly.
Although the benefit the customer can derive from the licence on its own (ie without the updates) is limited because the updates are integral to the customer's ability to continue to use the intellectual property in an industry in which technologies change rapidly, the licence can be used in a way that generates some economic benefits.
The drug is a mature product; therefore the entity will not undertake any activities to support the drug, which is consistent with its customary business practices.
In this case, no other entity can manufacture this drug because of the highly specialised nature of the manufacturing process.
As a result, the licence cannot be purchased separately from the manufacturing services.
Consequently, the licence and the manufacturing service are not distinct and the entity accounts for the licence and the manufacturing service as a single performance obligation.
In this case, the manufacturing process used to produce the drug is not unique or specialised and several other entities can also manufacture the drug for the customer.
In reaching this conclusion, the entity considers that the customer could separately purchase the licence without significantly affecting its ability to benefit from the licence.
Neither the licence, nor the manufacturing service, is significantly modified or customised by the other and the entity is not providing a significant service of integrating those items into a combined output.
The entity further considers that the licence and the manufacturing service are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated because the entity would be able to fulfil its promise to transfer the licence independently of fulfilling its promise to subsequently manufacture the drug for the customer.
Similarly, the entity would be able to manufacture the drug for the customer even if the customer had previously obtained the licence and initially utilised a different manufacturer.
licence of patent rights; and
For these types of mature products, the entity's customary business practices are not to undertake any activities to support the drug.
The drug compound has significant stand-alone functionality (ie its ability to produce a drug that treats a disease or condition).
Consequently, the customer obtains a substantial portion of the benefits of the drug compound from that functionality, rather than from the entity's ongoing activities.
In its assessment of the criteria in paragraph B58 of IFRS 15, the entity does not take into consideration the separate performance obligation of promising to provide a manufacturing service.
Consequently, the nature of the entity's promise in transferring the licence is to provide a right to use the entity's intellectual property in the form and the functionality with which it exists at the point in time that it is granted to the customer.
In addition to the licence, the entity also promises to provide the equipment necessary to operate a franchise store.
The entity observes that the entity, as a franchisor, has developed a customary business practice to undertake activities such as analysing consumers' changing preferences and implementing product improvements, pricing strategies, marketing campaigns and operational efficiencies to support the franchise name.
However, the entity concludes that these activities do not directly transfer goods or services to the customer because they are part of the entity's promise to grant a licence.
In addition, the entity concludes that the promise to grant the licence and the promise to transfer the equipment are each distinct.
The customer can benefit from the licence together with the equipment that is delivered before the opening of the franchise and the equipment can be used in the franchise or sold for an amount other than scrap value.
The entity concludes that the variable consideration (ie the sales-based royalty) should be allocated entirely to the franchise licence because the variable consideration relates entirely to the entity's promise to grant the franchise licence.
the entity concludes that the customer would reasonably expect that the entity will undertake activities that will significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights.
The ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual property to which the customer has rights is substantially derived from, or dependent upon, the expected activities of the entity.
This is on the basis of the entity's customary business practice to undertake activities such as analysing the consumers' changing preferences and implementing product improvements, pricing strategies, marketing campaigns and operational efficiencies.
In addition, the entity observes that because part of its compensation is dependent on the success of the franchisee (as evidenced through the sales-based royalty), the entity has a shared economic interest with the customer that indicates that the customer will expect the entity to undertake those activities to maximise earnings.
the entity also observes that the franchise licence requires the customer to implement any changes that result from those activities and thus exposes the customer to any positive or negative effects of those activities.
There are main characters involved in each of the comic strips.
However, newly created characters appear regularly and the images of the characters evolve over time.
The customer, an operator of cruise ships, can use the entity's characters in various ways, such as in shows or parades, within reasonable guidelines.
The contract requires the customer to use the latest images of the characters.
The entity concludes that it has no other performance obligations other than the promise to grant a licence.
That is, the additional activities associated with the licence do not directly transfer a good or service to the customer because they are part of the entity's promise to grant a licence.
the rights granted by the licence directly expose the customer to any positive or negative effects of the entity's activities because the contract requires the customer to use the latest characters.
even though the customer may benefit from those activities through the rights granted by the licence, they do not transfer a good or service to the customer as those activities occur.
Because the contract provides the customer with unlimited use of the licensed characters for a fixed term, the entity determines that a time-based method would be the most appropriate measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.
The entity concludes that its only performance obligation is to grant the licence.
The entity does not have any contractual or implied obligations to change the licensed recording.
Consequently, the entity concludes that the nature of its promise in transferring the licence is to provide the customer with a right to use the entity's intellectual property as it exists at the point in time that it is granted.
Therefore, the promise to grant the licence is a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time.
The entity recognises all of the revenue at the point in time when the customer can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the licensed intellectual property.
An entity, a movie distribution company, licenses Movie XYZ to a customer.
The entity concludes that the licence to show Movie XYZ is the predominant item to which the sales-based royalty relates because the entity has a reasonable expectation that the customer would ascribe significantly more value to the licence than to the related promotional goods or services.
If the licence, the memorabilia and the advertising activities are separate performance obligations, the entity would allocate the sales-based royalty to each performance obligation.
An entity, a well-known sports team, licenses the use of its name and logo to a customer.
The customer expects that the entity will continue to play games and provide a competitive team.
The entity concludes that its only performance obligation is to transfer the licence.
This is on the basis of the entity's customary business practice to undertake activities that support and maintain the value of the name and logo such as continuing to play and providing a competitive team.
The entity determines that the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the name and logo is substantially derived from, or dependent upon, the expected activities of the entity.
In addition, the entity observes that because some of its consideration is dependent on the success of the customer (through the sales-based royalty), the entity has a shared economic interest with the customer, which indicates that the customer will expect the entity to undertake those activities to maximise earnings.
Consequently, in accordance with paragraph B66(b) of IFRS 15, the entity accounts for the transaction as a financing arrangement, because the exercise price is more than the original selling price.
In accordance with paragraph B68 of IFRS 15, the entity does not derecognise the asset and instead recognises the cash received as a financial liability.
At the inception of the contract, the entity assesses whether the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the put option, to determine the accounting for the transfer of the asset (see paragraphs B70–B76 of IFRS 15).
The entity concludes that the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the put option because the repurchase price significantly exceeds the expected market value of the asset at the date of repurchase.
The entity determines there are no other relevant factors to consider when assessing whether the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the put option.
Consequently, the entity concludes that control of the asset does not transfer to the customer, because the customer is limited in its ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset.
Upon completion of manufacturing, the entity demonstrates that the machine and spare parts meet the agreed-upon specifications in the contract.
Although the customer inspects and accepts the spare parts, the customer requests that the spare parts be stored at the entity's warehouse because of its close proximity to the customer's factory.
The customer has legal title to the spare parts and the parts can be identified as belonging to the customer.
Furthermore, the entity stores the spare parts in a separate section of its warehouse and the parts are ready for immediate shipment at the customer's request.
The performance obligation to provide custodial services is satisfied over time as the services are provided.
In these examples monetary amounts are denominated in 'currency units' (CU).
This example assumes there is no material difference between the fair value of the receivable at contract inception and the fair value of the receivable when it is recognised at the time the right of return lapses.
In addition, this example does not consider the impairment accounting for the receivable.
Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
accounting and reporting by retirement benefit plans
Actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits
This Standard regards a retirement benefit plan as a reporting entity separate from the employers of the participants in the plan.
All other Standards apply to the financial statements of retirement benefit plans to the extent that they are not superseded by this Standard.
It does not deal with reports to individual participants about their retirement benefit rights.
Many require the creation of separate funds, which may or may not have separate legal identity and may or may not have trustees, to which contributions are made and from which retirement benefits are paid.
This Standard applies regardless of whether such a fund is created and regardless of whether there are trustees.
Accordingly, they are within the scope of this Standard unless the contract with the insurance company is in the name of a specified participant or a group of participants and the retirement benefit obligation is solely the responsibility of the insurance company.
Government social security type arrangements are also excluded from the scope of this Standard.
Defined contribution plans are retirement benefit plans under which amounts to be paid as retirement benefits are determined by contributions to a fund together with investment earnings thereon.
Funding is the transfer of assets to an entity (the fund) separate from the employer's entity to meet future obligations for the payment of retirement benefits.
For the purposes of this Standard the following terms are also used
Participants are the members of a retirement benefit plan and others who are entitled to benefits under the plan.
Net assets available for benefits are the assets of a plan less liabilities other than the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits.
Actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits is the present value of the expected payments by a retirement benefit plan to existing and past employees, attributable to the service already rendered.
Vested benefits are benefits, the rights to which, under the conditions of a retirement benefit plan, are not conditional on continued employment.
Some plans are informal but have acquired a degree of obligation as a result of employers' established practices.
While some plans permit employers to limit their obligations under the plans, it is usually difficult for an employer to cancel a plan if employees are to be retained.
The same basis of accounting and reporting applies to an informal plan as to a formal plan.
Such funds may be administered by parties who act independently in managing fund assets.
Those parties are called trustees in some countries.
The term trustee is used in this Standard to describe such parties regardless of whether a trust has been formed.
Occasionally plans exist that contain characteristics of both.
Such hybrid plans are considered to be defined benefit plans for the purposes of this Standard.
An employer's obligation is usually discharged by contributions to the fund.
An actuary's advice is not normally required although such advice is sometimes used to estimate future benefits that may be achievable based on present contributions and varying levels of future contributions and investment earnings.
Participants are interested in knowing whether contributions have been received and proper control has been exercised to protect the rights of beneficiaries.
An employer is interested in the efficient and fair operation of the plan.
That objective is usually achieved by providing financial statements including the following
a description of the investment policies.
the net assets available for benefits;
the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits, distinguishing between vested benefits and non-vested benefits; and
a statement of net assets available for benefits including either
a note disclosing the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits, distinguishing between vested benefits and non-vested benefits; or
a reference to this information in an accompanying actuarial report.
If an actuarial valuation has not been prepared at the date of the financial statements, the most recent valuation shall be used as a base and the date of the valuation disclosed.
The effect of any changes in actuarial assumptions that have had a significant effect on the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits shall also be disclosed.
This objective is usually achieved by providing financial statements including the following
statements reporting on the transactions and investment performance for the period and the financial position of the plan at the end of the period;
the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits, being the sum of the amounts presently attributable to each participant in the plan, can be calculated more objectively than with projected salary levels because it involves fewer assumptions;
the amount of the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits using current salary levels is generally more closely related to the amount payable in the event of termination or discontinuance of the plan.
financial information should be prepared on a going concern basis, irrespective of the assumptions and estimates that must be made;
failure to incorporate salary projections, when most funding is based on salary projections, may result in the reporting of an apparent overfunding when the plan is not overfunded, or in reporting adequate funding when the plan is underfunded.
The actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits based on projected salaries is disclosed to indicate the magnitude of the potential obligation on a going concern basis which is generally the basis for funding.
In addition to disclosure of the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits, sufficient explanation may need to be given so as to indicate clearly the context in which the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits should be read.
Such explanation may be in the form of information about the adequacy of the planned future funding and of the funding policy based on salary projections.
This may be included in the financial statements or in the actuary's report.
If an actuarial valuation has not been prepared at the date of the financial statements, the most recent valuation is used as a base and the date of the valuation disclosed.
a statement is included in the financial statements that shows the net assets available for benefits, the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits, and the resulting excess or deficit.
The financial statements of the plan also contain statements of changes in net assets available for benefits and changes in the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits.
The financial statements may be accompanied by a separate actuary's report supporting the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits;
financial statements that include a statement of net assets available for benefits and a statement of changes in net assets available for benefits.
The actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits is disclosed in a note to the statements.
financial statements that include a statement of net assets available for benefits and a statement of changes in net assets available for benefits with the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits contained in a separate actuarial report.
In each format a trustees' report in the nature of a management or directors' report and an investment report may also accompany the financial statements.
They also believe that financial statements should be complete in themselves and not rely on accompanying statements.
However, some believe that the format described in paragraph 28(a) could give the impression that a liability exists, whereas the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits does not in their opinion have all the characteristics of a liability.
They contend that actuaries do not necessarily compare actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits with market values of investments but may instead assess the present value of cash flows expected from the investments.
Therefore, those in favour of this format believe that such a comparison is unlikely to reflect the actuary's overall assessment of the plan and that it may be misunderstood.
Also, some believe that, regardless of whether quantified, the information about promised retirement benefits should be contained solely in the separate actuarial report where a proper explanation can be provided.
It rejects arguments against the quantification of the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits.
Accordingly, the formats described in paragraph 28(a) and (b) are considered acceptable under this Standard, as is the format described in paragraph 28(c) so long as the financial statements contain a reference to, and are accompanied by, an actuarial report that includes the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits.
In the case of marketable securities fair value is market value.
Where plan investments are held for which an estimate of fair value is not possible disclosure shall be made of the reason why fair value is not used.
Those securities that have a fixed redemption value and that have been acquired to match the obligations of the plan, or specific parts thereof, may be carried at amounts based on their ultimate redemption value assuming a constant rate of return to maturity.
Where plan investments are held for which an estimate of fair value is not possible, such as total ownership of an entity, disclosure is made of the reason why fair value is not used.
To the extent that investments are carried at amounts other than market value or fair value, fair value is generally also disclosed.
Assets used in the operations of the fund are accounted for in accordance with the applicable Standards.

Determining the fair value of equity instruments granted
Treatment of a reload feature
If the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be estimated reliably
Modifications to the terms and conditions on which equity instruments were granted, including cancellations and settlements
Treatment of vesting and non-vesting conditions
Share-based payment transactions in which the terms of the arrangement provide the counterparty with a choice of settlement
Share-based payment transactions in which the terms of the arrangement provide the entity with a choice of settlement
In particular, it requires an entity to reflect in its profit or loss and financial position the effects of share-based payment transactions, including expenses associated with transactions in which share options are granted to employees.
In the absence of specifically identifiable goods or services, other circumstances may indicate that goods or services have been (or will be) received, in which case this IFRS applies.
Goods includes inventories, consumables, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non-financial assets.
Hence, equity instruments issued in a business combination in exchange for control of the acquiree are not within the scope of this IFRS.
However, equity instruments granted to employees of the acquiree in their capacity as employees (eg in return for continued service) are within the scope of this IFRS.
Similarly, the cancellation, replacement or other modification of share-based payment arrangements because of a business combination or other equity restructuring shall be accounted for in accordance with this IFRS.
The entity shall recognise a corresponding increase in equity if the goods or services were received in an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, or a liability if the goods or services were acquired in a cash-settled share-based payment transaction.
For example, services are typically consumed immediately, in which case an expense is recognised as the counterparty renders service.
However, sometimes it is necessary to recognise an expense before the goods or services are consumed or sold, because they do not qualify for recognition as assets.
For example, an entity might acquire goods as part of the research phase of a project to develop a new product.
Although those goods have not been consumed, they might not qualify for recognition as assets under the applicable IFRS.
If the entity cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods or services received, the entity shall measure their value, and the corresponding increase in equity, indirectly, by reference to
Usually, it is not possible to measure directly the services received for particular components of the employee's remuneration package.
It might also not be possible to measure the fair value of the total remuneration package independently, without measuring directly the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Furthermore, shares or share options are sometimes granted as part of a bonus arrangement, rather than as a part of basic remuneration, eg as an incentive to the employees to remain in the entity's employ or to reward them for their efforts in improving the entity's performance.
By granting shares or share options, in addition to other remuneration, the entity is paying additional remuneration to obtain additional benefits.
Estimating the fair value of those additional benefits is likely to be difficult.
Because of the difficulty of measuring directly the fair value of the services received, the entity shall measure the fair value of the employee services received by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
That fair value shall be measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.
In rare cases, if the entity rebuts this presumption because it cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods or services received, the entity shall measure the goods or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, indirectly, by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.
The entity shall measure the identifiable goods or services received in accordance with this IFRS.
The entity shall measure the unidentifiable goods or services received (or to be received) as the difference between the fair value of the share-based payment and the fair value of any identifiable goods or services received (or to be received).
The entity shall measure the unidentifiable goods or services received at the grant date.
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the entity shall presume that services rendered by the counterparty as consideration for the equity instruments have been received.
In this case, on grant date the entity shall recognise the services received in full, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The entity shall account for those services as they are rendered by the counterparty during the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity.
if an employee is granted share options conditional upon the achievement of a performance condition and remaining in the entity's employ until that performance condition is satisfied, and the length of the vesting period varies depending on when that performance condition is satisfied, the entity shall presume that the services to be rendered by the employee as consideration for the share options will be received in the future, over the expected vesting period.
The entity shall estimate the length of the expected vesting period at grant date, based on the most likely outcome of the performance condition.
If the performance condition is not a market condition, the entity shall revise its estimate of the length of the vesting period, if necessary, if subsequent information indicates that the length of the vesting period differs from previous estimates.
A grant of equity instruments might be conditional upon satisfying specified vesting conditions.
For example, a grant of shares or share options to an employee is typically conditional on the employee remaining in the entity's employ for a specified period of time.
There might be performance conditions that must be satisfied, such as the entity achieving a specified growth in profit or a specified increase in the entity's share price.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the measurement date.
Instead, vesting conditions, other than market conditions, shall be taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately, the amount recognised for goods or services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted shall be based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest.
Therefore, for grants of equity instruments with market conditions, the entity shall recognise the goods or services received from a counterparty who satisfies all other vesting conditions (eg services received from an employee who remains in service for the specified period of service), irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied.
Similarly, an entity shall take into account all non-vesting conditions when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Therefore, for grants of equity instruments with non-vesting conditions, the entity shall recognise the goods or services received from a counterparty that satisfies all vesting conditions that are not market conditions (eg services received from an employee who remains in service for the specified period of service), irrespective of whether those non-vesting conditions are satisfied.
Instead, a reload option shall be accounted for as a new option grant, if and when a reload option is subsequently granted.
For example, the entity shall not subsequently reverse the amount recognised for services received from an employee if the vested equity instruments are later forfeited or, in the case of share options, the options are not exercised.
In these rare cases only, the entity shall instead
For a grant of share options, the share-based payment arrangement is finally settled when the options are exercised, are forfeited (eg upon cessation of employment) or lapse (eg at the end of the option's life).
recognise the goods or services received based on the number of equity instruments that ultimately vest or (where applicable) are ultimately exercised.
The amount recognised for goods or services received during the vesting period shall be based on the number of share options expected to vest.
The entity shall revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent information indicates that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
On vesting date, the entity shall revise the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that ultimately vested.
After vesting date, the entity shall reverse the amount recognised for goods or services received if the share options are later forfeited, or lapse at the end of the share option's life.
if the settlement occurs during the vesting period, the entity shall account for the settlement as an acceleration of vesting, and shall therefore recognise immediately the amount that would otherwise have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period.
any payment made on settlement shall be accounted for as the repurchase of equity instruments, ie as a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the intrinsic value of the equity instruments, measured at the repurchase date.
Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense.
For example, it might reduce the exercise price of options granted to employees (ie reprice the options), which increases the fair value of those options.
However, the requirements shall also be applied to share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees that are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
This applies irrespective of any modifications to the terms and conditions on which the equity instruments were granted, or a cancellation or settlement of that grant of equity instruments.
In addition, the entity shall recognise the effects of modifications that increase the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement or are otherwise beneficial to the employee.
Guidance on applying this requirement is given in Appendix B.
the entity shall account for the cancellation or settlement as an acceleration of vesting, and shall therefore recognise immediately the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period.
any payment made to the employee on the cancellation or settlement of the grant shall be accounted for as the repurchase of an equity interest, ie as a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the repurchase date.
However, if the share-based payment arrangement included liability components, the entity shall remeasure the fair value of the liability at the date of cancellation or settlement.
Any payment made to settle the liability component shall be accounted for as an extinguishment of the liability.
The net fair value of the cancelled equity instruments is their fair value, immediately before the cancellation, less the amount of any payment made to the employee on cancellation of the equity instruments that is accounted for as a deduction from equity in accordance with (b) above.
If the entity does not identify new equity instruments granted as replacement equity instruments for the cancelled equity instruments, the entity shall account for those new equity instruments as a new grant of equity instruments.
If an entity or counterparty can choose whether to meet a non-vesting condition, the entity shall treat the entity's or counterparty's failure to meet that non-vesting condition during the vesting period as a cancellation.
Until the liability is settled, the entity shall remeasure the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the period.
Alternatively, an entity might grant to its employees a right to receive a future cash payment by granting to them a right to shares (including shares to be issued upon the exercise of share options) that are redeemable, either mandatorily (for example, upon cessation of employment) or at the employee's option.
These arrangements are examples of cash-settled share-based payment transactions.
For example, some share appreciation rights vest immediately, and the employees are therefore not required to complete a specified period of service to become entitled to the cash payment.
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the entity shall presume that the services rendered by the employees in exchange for the share appreciation rights have been received.
Thus, the entity shall recognise immediately the services received and a liability to pay for them.
If the share appreciation rights do not vest until the employees have completed a specified period of service, the entity shall recognise the services received, and a liability to pay for them, as the employees render service during that period.
An entity might modify the terms and conditions on which a cash-settled share-based payment is granted.
Guidance for a modification of a share-based payment transaction that changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled is given in paragraphs B44A–B44C in Appendix B.
A cash-settled share-based payment transaction might be conditional upon satisfying specified vesting conditions.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the cash-settled share-based payment at the measurement date.
Instead, vesting conditions, other than market conditions, shall be taken into account by adjusting the number of awards included in the measurement of the liability arising from the transaction.
To apply the requirements in paragraph 33A, the entity shall recognise an amount for the goods or services received during the vesting period.
That amount shall be based on the best available estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest.
The entity shall revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent information indicates that the number of awards that are expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
On the vesting date, the entity shall revise the estimate to equal the number of awards that ultimately vested.
Market conditions, such as a target share price upon which vesting (or exercisability) is conditioned, as well as non-vesting conditions, shall be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the cash-settled share-based payment granted and when remeasuring the fair value at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement.
Share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations
To fulfil this obligation, the terms of the share-based payment arrangement may permit or require the entity to withhold the number of equity instruments equal to the monetary value of the employee's tax obligation from the total number of equity instruments that otherwise would have been issued to the employee upon exercise (or vesting) of the share-based payment (ie the share-based payment arrangement has a 'net settlement feature').
As an exception to the requirements in paragraph 34, the transaction described in paragraph 33E shall be classified in its entirety as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction if it would have been so classified in the absence of the net settlement feature.
Therefore, the payment made shall be accounted for as a deduction from equity for the shares withheld, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value at the net settlement date of the equity instruments withheld.
The exception in paragraph 33F does not apply to
a share-based payment arrangement with a net settlement feature for which there is no obligation on the entity under tax laws or regulations to withhold an amount for an employee's tax obligation associated with that share-based payment; or
any equity instruments that the entity withholds in excess of the employee's tax obligation associated with the share-based payment (ie the entity withheld an amount of shares that exceeds the monetary value of the employee's tax obligation).
Such excess shares withheld shall be accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment when this amount is paid in cash (or other assets) to the employee.
Share-based payment transactions with cash alternatives
For transactions with parties other than employees, in which the fair value of the goods or services received is measured directly, the entity shall measure the equity component of the compound financial instrument as the difference between the fair value of the goods or services received and the fair value of the debt component, at the date when the goods or services are received.
For example, the counterparty might have the choice of receiving share options or cash-settled share appreciation rights.
If the entity issues equity instruments on settlement rather than paying cash, the liability shall be transferred direct to equity, as the consideration for the equity instruments issued.
Any equity component previously recognised shall remain within equity.
By electing to receive cash on settlement, the counterparty forfeited the right to receive equity instruments.
The entity has a present obligation to settle in cash if the choice of settlement in equity instruments has no commercial substance (eg because the entity is legally prohibited from issuing shares), or the entity has a past practice or a stated policy of settling in cash, or generally settles in cash whenever the counterparty asks for cash settlement.
if the entity elects to settle in cash, the cash payment shall be accounted for as the repurchase of an equity interest, ie as a deduction from equity, except as noted in (c) below.
if the entity elects the settlement alternative with the higher fair value, as at the date of settlement, the entity shall recognise an additional expense for the excess value given, ie the difference between the cash paid and the fair value of the equity instruments that would otherwise have been issued, or the difference between the fair value of the equity instruments issued and the amount of cash that would otherwise have been paid, whichever is applicable.
For share-based payment transactions among group entities, in its separate or individual financial statements, the entity receiving the goods or services shall measure the goods or services received as either an equity-settled or a cash-settled share-based payment transaction by assessing
the nature of the awards granted, and
its own rights and obligations.
The amount recognised by the entity receiving the goods or services may differ from the amount recognised by the consolidated group or by another group entity settling the share-based payment transaction.
The entity receiving the goods or services shall measure the goods or services received as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction when
the awards granted are its own equity instruments, or
the entity has no obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction.
In all other circumstances, the entity receiving the goods or services shall measure the goods or services received as a cash-settled share-based payment transaction.
The entity settling a share-based payment transaction when another entity in the group receives the goods or services shall recognise the transaction as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction only if it is settled in the entity's own equity instruments.
Otherwise, the transaction shall be recognised as a cash-settled share-based payment transaction.
In such cases, the entity that receives the goods or services shall account for the share-based payment transaction in accordance with paragraph 43B regardless of intragroup repayment arrangements.

If options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the period, the entity may instead disclose the weighted average share price during the period.
for share options outstanding at the end of the period, the range of exercise prices and weighted average remaining contractual life.
If the range of exercise prices is wide, the outstanding options shall be divided into ranges that are meaningful for assessing the number and timing of additional shares that may be issued and the cash that may be received upon exercise of those options.
for share options granted during the period, the weighted average fair value of those options at the measurement date and information on how that fair value was measured, including
the option pricing model used and the inputs to that model, including the weighted average share price, exercise price, expected volatility, option life, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and any other inputs to the model, including the method used and the assumptions made to incorporate the effects of expected early exercise;
how expected volatility was determined, including an explanation of the extent to which expected volatility was based on historical volatility; and
for other equity instruments granted during the period (ie other than share options), the number and weighted average fair value of those equity instruments at the measurement date, and information on how that fair value was measured, including
if fair value was not measured on the basis of an observable market price, how it was determined;
whether and how expected dividends were incorporated into the measurement of fair value; and
(iii) whether and how any other features of the equity instruments granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

the incremental fair value granted (as a result of those modifications); and
the total expense recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions in which the goods or services received did not qualify for recognition as assets and hence were recognised immediately as an expense, including separate disclosure of that portion of the total expense that arises from transactions accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions;
for liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions
the total carrying amount at the end of the period; and
the total intrinsic value at the end of the period of liabilities for which the counterparty's right to cash or other assets had vested by the end of the period (eg vested share appreciation rights).
For example, if an entity has classified any share-based payment transactions as equity-settled in accordance with paragraph 33F, the entity shall disclose an estimate of the amount that it expects to transfer to the tax authority to settle the employee's tax obligation when it is necessary to inform users about the future cash flow effects associated with the share-based payment arrangement.
Prior periods shall not be restated.
For unvested share-based payment transactions granted prior to the date that an entity first applies the amendments, an entity shall remeasure the liability at that date and recognise the effect of the remeasurement in opening retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) of the reporting period in which the amendments are first applied.
For unvested (or vested but unexercised) share-based payment transactions (or components thereof) that were previously classified as cash-settled share-based payments but now are classified as equity-settled in accordance with the amendments, an entity shall reclassify the carrying value of the share-based payment liability to equity at the date that it first applies the amendments.

Estimating the fair value of equity instruments granted
Paragraphs B2–B41 of this appendix discuss measurement of the fair value of shares and share options granted, focusing on the specific terms and conditions that are common features of a grant of shares or share options to employees.
Therefore, it is not exhaustive.
Furthermore, because the valuation issues discussed below focus on shares and share options granted to employees, it is assumed that the fair value of the shares or share options is measured at grant date.
However, many of the valuation issues discussed below (eg determining expected volatility) also apply in the context of estimating the fair value of shares or share options granted to parties other than employees at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.
For example, if the employee is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, this factor shall be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares granted.
Similarly, if the shares are subject to restrictions on transfer after vesting date, that factor shall be taken into account, but only to the extent that the post-vesting restrictions affect the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would pay for that share.
For example, if the shares are actively traded in a deep and liquid market, post-vesting transfer restrictions may have little, if any, effect on the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would pay for those shares.
For share options granted to employees, in many cases market prices are not available, because the options granted are subject to terms and conditions that do not apply to traded options.
If traded options with similar terms and conditions do not exist, the fair value of the options granted shall be estimated by applying an option pricing model.
The entity shall consider factors that knowledgeable, willing market participants would consider in selecting the option pricing model to apply.
For example, many employee options have long lives, are usually exercisable during the period between vesting date and the end of the options' life, and are often exercised early.
These factors should be considered when estimating the grant date fair value of the options.
For many entities, this might preclude the use of the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, which does not allow for the possibility of exercise before the end of the option's life and may not adequately reflect the effects of expected early exercise.
It also does not allow for the possibility that expected volatility and other model inputs might vary over the option's life.
However, for share options with relatively short contractual lives, or that must be exercised within a short period of time after vesting date, the factors identified above may not apply.
In these instances, the Black-Scholes-Merton formula may produce a value that is substantially the same as a more flexible option pricing model.
All option pricing models take into account, as a minimum, the following factors
the exercise price of the option;
the life of the option;
the current price of the underlying shares;
the expected volatility of the share price;
the risk-free interest rate for the life of the option.
For example, a share option granted to an employee typically cannot be exercised during specified periods (eg during the vesting period or during periods specified by securities regulators).
This factor shall be taken into account if the option pricing model applied would otherwise assume that the option could be exercised at any time during its life.
However, if an entity uses an option pricing model that values options that can be exercised only at the end of the options' life, no adjustment is required for the inability to exercise them during the vesting period (or other periods during the options' life), because the model assumes that the options cannot be exercised during those periods.
Similarly, another factor common to employee share options is the possibility of early exercise of the option, for example, because the option is not freely transferable, or because the employee must exercise all vested options upon cessation of employment.
The effects of expected early exercise shall be taken into account, as discussed in paragraphs B16–B21.
Factors that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would not consider in setting the price of a share option (or other equity instrument) shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of share options (or other equity instruments) granted.
For example, for share options granted to employees, factors that affect the value of the option from the individual employee's perspective only are not relevant to estimating the price that would be set by a knowledgeable, willing market participant.
Inputs to option pricing models
In estimating the expected volatility of and dividends on the underlying shares, the objective is to approximate the expectations that would be reflected in a current market or negotiated exchange price for the option.
Similarly, when estimating the effects of early exercise of employee share options, the objective is to approximate the expectations that an outside party with access to detailed information about employees' exercise behaviour would develop based on information available at the grant date.
Often, there is likely to be a range of reasonable expectations about future volatility, dividends and exercise behaviour.
If so, an expected value should be calculated, by weighting each amount within the range by its associated probability of occurrence.
Expectations about the future are generally based on experience, modified if the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past.
In some circumstances, identifiable factors may indicate that unadjusted historical experience is a relatively poor predictor of future experience.
In other circumstances, historical information may not be available.
For example, a newly listed entity will have little, if any, historical data on the volatility of its share price.
Unlisted and newly listed entities are discussed further below.
In summary, an entity should not simply base estimates of volatility, exercise behaviour and dividends on historical information without considering the extent to which the past experience is expected to be reasonably predictive of future experience.
Employees often exercise share options early, for a variety of reasons.
For example, employee share options are typically non-transferable.
This often causes employees to exercise their share options early, because that is the only way for the employees to liquidate their position.
Also, employees who cease employment are usually required to exercise any vested options within a short period of time, otherwise the share options are forfeited.
This factor also causes the early exercise of employee share options.
Other factors causing early exercise are risk aversion and lack of wealth diversification.
The means by which the effects of expected early exercise are taken into account depends upon the type of option pricing model applied.
For example, expected early exercise could be taken into account by using an estimate of the option's expected life (which, for an employee share option, is the period of time from grant date to the date on which the option is expected to be exercised) as an input into an option pricing model (eg the Black-Scholes-Merton formula).
Alternatively, expected early exercise could be modelled in a binomial or similar option pricing model that uses contractual life as an input.
Factors to consider in estimating early exercise include
the length of the vesting period, because the share option typically cannot be exercised until the end of the vesting period.
Hence, determining the valuation implications of expected early exercise is based on the assumption that the options will vest.
the average length of time similar options have remained outstanding in the past.
the price of the underlying shares.
Experience may indicate that the employees tend to exercise options when the share price reaches a specified level above the exercise price.
the employee's level within the organisation.
For example, experience might indicate that higher-level employees tend to exercise options later than lower-level employees (discussed further in paragraph B21).
expected volatility of the underlying shares.
On average, employees might tend to exercise options on highly volatile shares earlier than on shares with low volatility.
As noted in paragraph B17, the effects of early exercise could be taken into account by using an estimate of the option's expected life as an input into an option pricing model.
When estimating the expected life of share options granted to a group of employees, the entity could base that estimate on an appropriately weighted average expected life for the entire employee group or on appropriately weighted average lives for subgroups of employees within the group, based on more detailed data about employees' exercise behaviour (discussed further below).
Separating an option grant into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behaviour is likely to be important.
That means that calculating estimated option value on the basis of a single weighted average life that includes widely differing individual lives would overstate the total fair value of the share options granted.
Separating options granted into several groups, each of which has a relatively narrow range of lives included in its weighted average life, reduces that overstatement.
Similar considerations apply when using a binomial or similar model.
For example, the experience of an entity that grants options broadly to all levels of employees might indicate that top-level executives tend to hold their options longer than middle-management employees hold theirs and that lower-level employees tend to exercise their options earlier than any other group.
In addition, employees who are encouraged or required to hold a minimum amount of their employer's equity instruments, including options, might on average exercise options later than employees not subject to that provision.
In those situations, separating options by groups of recipients with relatively homogeneous exercise behaviour will result in a more accurate estimate of the total fair value of the share options granted.
Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price is expected to fluctuate during a period.
The measure of volatility used in option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time.
Factors to consider in estimating expected volatility include
implied volatility from traded share options on the entity's shares, or other traded instruments of the entity that include option features (such as convertible debt), if any.
the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option (taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option and the effects of expected early exercise).
the length of time an entity's shares have been publicly traded.
A newly listed entity might have a high historical volatility, compared with similar entities that have been listed longer.
Further guidance for newly listed entities is given below.
the tendency of volatility to revert to its mean, ie its long-term average level, and other factors indicating that expected future volatility might differ from past volatility.
appropriate and regular intervals for price observations.
The price observations should be consistent from period to period.
Also, the price observations should be expressed in the same currency as the exercise price.
As noted in paragraph B25, an entity should consider historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected option term.
If a newly listed entity does not have sufficient information on historical volatility, it should nevertheless compute historical volatility for the longest period for which trading activity is available.
It could also consider the historical volatility of similar entities following a comparable period in their lives.
An unlisted entity will not have historical information to consider when estimating expected volatility.
Some factors to consider instead are set out below.
In some cases, an unlisted entity that regularly issues options or shares to employees (or other parties) might have set up an internal market for its shares.
The volatility of those share prices could be considered when estimating expected volatility.
Alternatively, the entity could consider the historical or implied volatility of similar listed entities, for which share price or option price information is available, to use when estimating expected volatility.
This would be appropriate if the entity has based the value of its shares on the share prices of similar listed entities.
If the entity has not based its estimate of the value of its shares on the share prices of similar listed entities, and has instead used another valuation methodology to value its shares, the entity could derive an estimate of expected volatility consistent with that valuation methodology.
For example, the entity might value its shares on a net asset or earnings basis.
It could consider the expected volatility of those net asset values or earnings.
Whether expected dividends should be taken into account when measuring the fair value of shares or options granted depends on whether the counterparty is entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents.
Similarly, when the grant date fair value of shares granted to employees is estimated, no adjustment is required for expected dividends if the employee is entitled to receive dividends paid during the vesting period.
Conversely, if the employees are not entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period (or before exercise, in the case of an option), the grant date valuation of the rights to shares or options should take expected dividends into account.
That is to say, when the fair value of an option grant is estimated, expected dividends should be included in the application of an option pricing model.
When the fair value of a share grant is estimated, that valuation should be reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period.
Option pricing models generally call for expected dividend yield.
However, the models may be modified to use an expected dividend amount rather than a yield.
An entity may use either its expected yield or its expected payments.
If the entity uses the latter, it should consider its historical pattern of increases in dividends.
Generally, the assumption about expected dividends should be based on publicly available information.
However, an emerging entity with no history of paying dividends might expect to begin paying dividends during the expected lives of its employee share options.
When these share options are exercised, the writer delivers shares to the option holder.
Those shares are acquired from existing shareholders.
Hence the exercise of traded share options has no dilutive effect.
In contrast, if share options are written by the entity, new shares are issued when those share options are exercised (either actually issued or issued in substance, if shares previously repurchased and held in treasury are used).
Given that the shares will be issued at the exercise price rather than the current market price at the date of exercise, this actual or potential dilution might reduce the share price, so that the option holder does not make as large a gain on exercise as on exercising an otherwise similar traded option that does not dilute the share price.
Whether this has a significant effect on the value of the share options granted depends on various factors, such as the number of new shares that will be issued on exercise of the options compared with the number of shares already issued.
Also, if the market already expects that the option grant will take place, the market may have already factored the potential dilution into the share price at the date of grant.
However, the entity should consider whether the possible dilutive effect of the future exercise of the share options granted might have an impact on their estimated fair value at grant date.
Option pricing models can be adapted to take into account this potential dilutive effect.
Modifications to equity-settled share-based payment arrangements
In addition, the entity should recognise the effects of modifications that increase the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement or are otherwise beneficial to the employee.
if the modification increases the fair value of the equity instruments granted (eg by reducing the exercise price), measured immediately before and after the modification, the entity shall include the incremental fair value granted in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted.
The incremental fair value granted is the difference between the fair value of the modified equity instrument and that of the original equity instrument, both estimated as at the date of the modification.
If the modification occurs during the vesting period, the incremental fair value granted is included in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received over the period from the modification date until the date when the modified equity instruments vest, in addition to the amount based on the grant date fair value of the original equity instruments, which is recognised over the remainder of the original vesting period.
If the modification occurs after vesting date, the incremental fair value granted is recognised immediately, or over the vesting period if the employee is required to complete an additional period of service before becoming unconditionally entitled to those modified equity instruments.
similarly, if the modification increases the number of equity instruments granted, the entity shall include the fair value of the additional equity instruments granted, measured at the date of the modification, in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted, consistently with the requirements in (a) above.
For example, if the modification occurs during the vesting period, the fair value of the additional equity instruments granted is included in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received over the period from the modification date until the date when the additional equity instruments vest, in addition to the amount based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments originally granted, which is recognised over the remainder of the original vesting period.
if the modification reduces the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured immediately before and after the modification, the entity shall not take into account that decrease in fair value and shall continue to measure the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Accounting for a modification of a share-based payment transaction that changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled
If the terms and conditions of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction are modified with the result that it becomes an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, the transaction is accounted for as such from the date of the modification.
If, as a result of the modification, the vesting period is extended or shortened, the application of the requirements in paragraph B44A reflect the modified vesting period.
The requirements in paragraph B44A apply even if the modification occurs after the vesting period.
A cash-settled share-based payment transaction may be cancelled or settled (other than a transaction cancelled by forfeiture when the vesting conditions are not satisfied).
If equity instruments are granted and, on that grant date, the entity identifies them as a replacement for the cancelled cash-settled share-based payment, the entity shall apply paragraphs B44A and B44B.
Paragraphs B46–B61 discuss how to apply the requirements in paragraphs 43A–43C.
As noted in paragraph 43D, share-based payment transactions among group entities may take place for a variety of reasons depending on facts and circumstances.
Therefore, this discussion is not exhaustive and assumes that when the entity receiving the goods or services has no obligation to settle the transaction, the transaction is a parent's equity contribution to the subsidiary, regardless of any intragroup repayment arrangements.
Although the discussion below focuses on transactions with employees, it also applies to similar share-based payment transactions with suppliers of goods or services other than employees.
For convenience, the examples below discuss the issues in terms of a parent and its subsidiary.
an entity grants to its employees rights to equity instruments of the entity (eg share options), and either chooses or is required to buy equity instruments (ie treasury shares) from another party, to satisfy its obligations to its employees; and
an entity's employees are granted rights to equity instruments of the entity (eg share options), either by the entity itself or by its shareholders, and the shareholders of the entity provide the equity instruments needed.
The entity shall account for share-based payment transactions in which it receives services as consideration for its own equity instruments as equity-settled.
This applies regardless of whether the entity chooses or is required to buy those equity instruments from another party to satisfy its obligations to its employees under the share-based payment arrangement.
If the shareholder has an obligation to settle the transaction with its investee's employees, it provides equity instruments of its investee rather than its own.
Therefore, if its investee is in the same group as the shareholder, in accordance with paragraph 43C, the shareholder shall measure its obligation in accordance with the requirements applicable to cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the shareholder's separate financial statements and those applicable to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the shareholder's consolidated financial statements.
Share-based payment arrangements involving equity instruments of the parent
For example, employees of a subsidiary are granted rights to equity instruments of its parent as consideration for the services provided to the subsidiary.
a subsidiary grants rights to equity instruments of its parent to its employees: the subsidiary has the obligation to provide its employees with the equity instruments.
A parent grants rights to its equity instruments to the employees of its subsidiary (paragraph B52(a))
The subsidiary does not have an obligation to provide its parent's equity instruments to the subsidiary's employees.
Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 43B, the subsidiary shall measure the services received from its employees in accordance with the requirements applicable to equity-settled share-based payment transactions, and recognise a corresponding increase in equity as a contribution from the parent.
The parent has an obligation to settle the transaction with the subsidiary's employees by providing the parent's own equity instruments.
Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 43C, the parent shall measure its obligation in accordance with the requirements applicable to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
A subsidiary grants rights to equity instruments of its parent to its employees (paragraph B52(b))
Because the subsidiary does not meet either of the conditions in paragraph 43B, it shall account for the transaction with its employees as cash-settled.
This requirement applies irrespective of how the subsidiary obtains the equity instruments to satisfy its obligations to its employees.
Share-based payment arrangements involving cash-settled payments to employees
For example, consider the following arrangements in which the parent (not the entity itself) has an obligation to make the required cash payments to the employees of the entity
the employees of the entity will receive cash payments that are linked to the price of its equity instruments.
the employees of the entity will receive cash payments that are linked to the price of its parent's equity instruments.
The subsidiary does not have an obligation to settle the transaction with its employees.
Therefore, the subsidiary shall account for the transaction with its employees as equity-settled, and recognise a corresponding increase in equity as a contribution from its parent.
This differs from the measurement of the transaction as cash-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the group.
Transfer of employees between group entities
For example, a parent might grant rights to its equity instruments to the employees of its subsidiaries, conditional upon the completion of continuing service with the group for a specified period.
If the subsidiaries have no obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction with their employees, they account for it as an equity-settled transaction.
Each subsidiary shall measure the services received from the employee by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date the rights to those equity instruments were originally granted by the parent as defined in Appendix A, and the proportion of the vesting period the employee served with each subsidiary.
If the subsidiary has an obligation to settle the transaction with its employees in its parent's equity instruments, it accounts for the transaction as cash-settled.
Each subsidiary shall measure the services received on the basis of grant date fair value of the equity instruments for the proportion of the vesting period the employee served with each subsidiary.
In addition, each subsidiary shall recognise any change in the fair value of the equity instruments during the employee's service period with each subsidiary.
Such an employee, after transferring between group entities, may fail to satisfy a vesting condition other than a market condition as defined in Appendix A, eg the employee leaves the group before completing the service period.
Hence, if the rights to the equity instruments granted by the parent do not vest because of an employee's failure to meet a vesting condition other than a market condition, no amount is recognised on a cumulative basis for the services received from that employee in the financial statements of any group entity.
members' shares in co-operative entities and similar instruments
National laws typically define a co-operative as a society endeavouring to promote its members' economic advancement by way of a joint business operation (the principle of self-help).
Members' interests in a co-operative are often characterised as members' shares, units or the like, and are referred to below as 'members' shares'.
In particular, those principles apply to the classification of puttable instruments that allow the holder to put those instruments to the issuer for cash or another financial instrument.
The application of those principles to members' shares in co-operative entities and similar instruments is difficult.
This Interpretation does not apply to financial instruments that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments.
Some financial instruments give the holder the right to request redemption for cash or another financial asset, but may include or be subject to limits on whether the financial instruments will be redeemed.
How should those redemption terms be evaluated in determining whether the financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity?
Rather, the entity must consider all of the terms and conditions of the financial instrument in determining its classification as a financial liability or equity.
Those terms and conditions include relevant local laws, regulations and the entity's governing charter in effect at the date of classification, but not expected future amendments to those laws, regulations or charter.
Demand deposits, including current accounts, deposit accounts and similar contracts that arise when members act as customers are financial liabilities of the entity.
If redemption is unconditionally prohibited by local law, regulation or the entity's governing charter, members' shares are equity.
An unconditional prohibition may be partial, in that it prohibits redemption of members' shares if redemption would cause the number of members' shares or amount of paid-in capital from members' shares to fall below a specified level.
In some cases, the number of shares or the amount of paid-in capital subject to a redemption prohibition may change from time to time.
Such a change in the redemption prohibition leads to a transfer between financial liabilities and equity.
Interest, dividends and other returns relating to financial instruments classified as financial liabilities are expenses, regardless of whether those amounts paid are legally characterised as dividends, interest or otherwise.
This Interpretation shall be applied retrospectively.
Unconditional right to refuse redemption (paragraph 7)
The entity's charter states that redemptions are made at the sole discretion of the entity.
The charter does not provide further elaboration or limitation on that discretion.
In its history, the entity has never refused to redeem members' shares, although the governing board has the right to do so.
The entity has the unconditional right to refuse redemption and the members' shares are equity.
When preference shares are non-redeemable, the appropriate classification is determined by the other rights that attach to them.
Classification is based on an assessment of the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
When distributions to holders of the preference shares, whether cumulative or non-cumulative, are at the discretion of the issuer, the shares are equity instruments.
The classification of a preference share as an equity instrument or a financial liability is not affected by, for example
However, the charter further states that approval of a redemption request is automatic unless the entity is unable to make payments without violating local regulations regarding liquidity or reserves.
The entity does not have the unconditional right to refuse redemption and the members' shares are a financial liability.
The restrictions described above are based on the entity's ability to settle its liability.
Hence, they do not, under the principles established in IAS 32, result in the classification of the financial instrument as equity.
Preference shares may be issued with various rights.
In determining whether a preference share is a financial liability or an equity instrument, an issuer assesses the particular rights attaching to the share to determine whether it exhibits the fundamental characteristic of a financial liability.
For example, a preference share that provides for redemption on a specific date or at the option of the holder contains a financial liability because the issuer has an obligation to transfer financial assets to the holder of the share.
The potential inability of an issuer to satisfy an obligation to redeem a preference share when contractually required to do so, whether because of a lack of funds, a statutory restriction or insufficient profits or reserves, does not negate the obligation.
A co-operative entity has issued shares to its members at different dates and for different amounts in the past as follows
Shares are redeemable on demand at the amount for which they were issued.
Before the governing charter is amended
Members' shares in excess of the prohibition against redemption are financial liabilities.
The co-operative entity measures this financial liability at fair value at initial recognition.
Accordingly, the co-operative entity classifies as financial liabilities the maximum amount payable on demand under the redemption provisions.
In this example no gain or loss is recognised.
After the governing charter is amended
In this example the entity does not recognise a gain or loss on the transfer.
The financial instrument is a financial liability even when the amount of cash or other financial assets is determined on the basis of an index or other item that has the potential to increase or decrease.
The existence of an option for the holder to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset means that the puttable instrument meets the definition of a financial liability, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.
Those restrictions are limitations on the ability of the entity to pay the amount due on a financial liability, ie they prevent payment of the liability only if specified conditions are met.
In contrast, this example describes an unconditional prohibition on redemptions beyond a specified amount, regardless of the entity's ability to redeem members' shares (eg given its cash resources, profits or distributable reserves).
In effect, the prohibition against redemption prevents the entity from incurring any financial liability to redeem more than a specified amount of paid-in capital.
Therefore, the portion of shares subject to the redemption prohibition is not a financial liability.
While each member's shares may be redeemable individually, a portion of the total shares outstanding is not redeemable in any circumstances other than liquidation of the entity.
In addition, at the end of the reporting period, liquidity requirements imposed in the local jurisdiction prevent the entity from redeeming any members' shares unless its holdings of cash and short-term investments are greater than a specified amount.
This is because the amount classified as a liability is based on the entity's unconditional right to refuse redemption and not on conditional restrictions that prevent redemption only if liquidity or other conditions are not met and then only until such time as they are met.
Proceeds from issuing members' shares must be applied to redeem shares for which members have requested redemption.
The entity is a co-operative bank.
The effect of the regulation is that if all of a co-operative's outstanding liabilities are in the form of members' shares, it is able to redeem them all.
The terms of the members' share accounts permit the holder to redeem them on demand and there are no limitations on redemption in the entity's charter.
In this example members' shares are classified as financial liabilities.
The restriction is a conditional limitation on the ability of the entity to pay the amount due on a financial liability, ie they prevent payment of the liability only if specified conditions are met.
Consequently, the prohibition against redemption does not prevent the entity from incurring a financial liability to redeem more than a specified number of members' shares or amount of paid-in capital.
It allows the entity only to defer redemption until a condition is met, ie the repayment of other liabilities.
Members' shares in this example are not subject to an unconditional prohibition against redemption and are therefore classified as financial liabilities.
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1)
Minimum components of an interim financial report
Form and content of interim financial statements
Disclosure of compliance with IFRSs
Periods for which interim financial statements are required to be presented
Same accounting policies as annual
Applying the recognition and measurement principles
The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the minimum content of an interim financial report and to prescribe the principles for recognition and measurement in complete or condensed financial statements for an interim period.
Timely and reliable interim financial reporting improves the ability of investors, creditors, and others to understand an entity's capacity to generate earnings and cash flows and its financial condition and liquidity.
However, governments, securities regulators, stock exchanges, and accountancy bodies often require entities whose debt or equity securities are publicly traded to publish interim financial reports.
This Standard applies if an entity is required or elects to publish an interim financial report in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs).
Specifically, publicly traded entities are encouraged
a statement of financial position as at the end of the period;
a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the period;
a statement of changes in equity for the period;
a statement of cash flows for the period;
notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information;
An entity may use titles for the statements other than those used in this Standard.
For example, an entity may use the title 'statement of comprehensive income' instead of 'statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income'.
This Standard defines the minimum content of an interim financial report as including condensed financial statements and selected explanatory notes.
Accordingly, it focuses on new activities, events, and circumstances and does not duplicate information previously reported.
Nor does this Standard prohibit or discourage an entity from including in condensed interim financial statements more than the minimum line items or selected explanatory notes as set out in this Standard.
The recognition and measurement guidance in this Standard applies also to complete financial statements for an interim period, and such statements would include all of the disclosures required by this Standard (particularly the selected note disclosures in paragraph 16A) as well as those required by other IFRSs.
a condensed statement of financial position;
a condensed statement or condensed statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income;
a condensed statement of changes in equity;
Additional line items or notes shall be included if their omission would make the condensed interim financial statements misleading.
the write-down of inventories to net realisable value and the reversal of such a write-down;
recognition of a loss from the impairment of financial assets, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, assets arising from contracts with customers, or other assets, and the reversal of such an impairment loss;
the reversal of any provisions for the costs of restructuring;
acquisitions and disposals of items of property, plant and equipment;
commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment;
corrections of prior period errors;
changes in the business or economic circumstances that affect the fair value of the entity's financial assets and financial liabilities, whether those assets or liabilities are recognised at fair value or amortised cost;
any loan default or breach of a loan agreement that has not been remedied on or before the end of the reporting period;
transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments;
(m) changes in contingent liabilities or contingent assets.
When an event or transaction is significant to an understanding of the changes in an entity's financial position or performance since the last annual reporting period, its interim financial report should provide an explanation of and an update to the relevant information included in the financial statements of the last annual reporting period.
The following disclosures shall be given either in the interim financial statements or incorporated by cross-reference from the interim financial statements to some other statement (such as management commentary or risk report) that is available to users of the financial statements on the same terms as the interim financial statements and at the same time.
If users of the financial statements do not have access to the information incorporated by cross-reference on the same terms and at the same time, the interim financial report is incomplete.
explanatory comments about the seasonality or cyclicality of interim operations.
the nature and amount of items affecting assets, liabilities, equity, net income or cash flows that are unusual because of their nature, size or incidence.
issues, repurchases and repayments of debt and equity securities.
dividends paid (aggregate or per share) separately for ordinary shares and other shares.
revenues from external customers, if included in the measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by the chief operating decision maker or otherwise regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.
(iii) a measure of segment profit or loss.
(vi) a reconciliation of the total of the reportable segments' measures of profit or loss to the entity's profit or loss before tax expense (tax income) and discontinued operations.
However, if an entity allocates to reportable segments items such as tax expense (tax income), the entity may reconcile the total of the segments' measures of profit or loss to profit or loss after those items.
Material reconciling items shall be separately identified and described in that reconciliation.
events after the interim period that have not been reflected in the financial statements for the interim period.
the effect of changes in the composition of the entity during the interim period, including business combinations, obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries and long-term investments, restructurings, and discontinued operations.
An interim financial report shall not be described as complying with IFRSs unless it complies with all the requirements of IFRSs.
statement of financial position as of the end of the current interim period and a comparative statement of financial position as of the end of the immediately preceding financial year.
Accordingly, entities whose business is highly seasonal are encouraged to consider reporting such information in addition to the information called for in the preceding paragraph.
Thus, for example, unusual items, changes in accounting policies or estimates, and errors are recognised and disclosed on the basis of materiality in relation to interim period data to avoid misleading inferences that might result from non-disclosure.
The overriding goal is to ensure that an interim financial report includes all information that is relevant to understanding an entity's financial position and performance during the interim period.
Paragraph 16A(d) of this Standard requires similar disclosure in an interim financial report.
If those inflows or outflows have taken place, the related revenue and expense are recognised; otherwise they are not recognised.
The Conceptual Framework does not allow the recognition of items in the statement of financial position which do not meet the definition of assets or liabilities.
The amounts reported in prior interim periods are not retrospectively adjusted.
Such revenues are recognised when they occur.
Under IAS 8, a change in accounting policy is reflected by retrospective application, with restatement of prior period financial data as far back as is practicable.
The result would be interim allocation difficulties, obscured operating results, and complicated analysis and understandability of interim period information.
Earlier application is permitted.If an entity applies that amendment for an earlier period it shall disclose that fact.
Earlier application of that amendment is permitted.
foreign currency transactions and advance consideration
The related asset, expense or income (or part of it) is the amount recognised applying relevant Standards, which results in the derecognition of the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration.
The question specifically addressed circumstances in which an entity recognises a non-monetary liability arising from the receipt of advance consideration before it recognises the related revenue.
In discussing the issue, the Interpretations Committee noted that the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign currency is not restricted to revenue transactions.
Accordingly, the Interpretations Committee decided to clarify the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income when an entity has received or paid advance consideration in a foreign currency.
insurance contracts (including reinsurance contracts) that it issues or reinsurance contracts that it holds.
prospectively to all assets, expenses and income in the scope of the Interpretation initially recognised on or after
the beginning of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the Interpretation; or
the beginning of a prior reporting period presented as comparative information in the financial statements of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the Interpretation.
An entity that applies paragraph A2(b) shall, on initial application, apply the Interpretation to assets, expenses and income initially recognised on or after the beginning of the reporting period in paragraph A2(b)(i) or (ii) for which the entity has recognised non-monetary assets or non-monetary liabilities arising from advance consideration before that date.
stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting
This waste removal activity is known as 'stripping'.
Those capitalised costs are depreciated or amortised on a systematic basis, usually by using the units of production method, once production begins.
The ratio of ore to waste can range from uneconomic low grade to profitable high grade.
Removal of material with a low ratio of ore to waste may produce some usable material, which can be used to produce inventory.
This removal might also provide access to deeper levels of material that have a higher ratio of ore to waste.

Recognition of production stripping costs as an asset
This Interpretation refers to the non-current asset as the 'stripping activity asset'.
it is probable that the future economic benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to the entity;
the entity can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved; and
the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that component can be measured reliably.
In other words, the stripping activity asset will be accounted for as part of an existing asset.
In other words, the nature of this existing asset will determine whether the entity shall classify the stripping activity asset as tangible or intangible.
Initial measurement of the stripping activity asset
Some incidental operations may take place at the same time as the production stripping activity, but which are not necessary for the production stripping activity to continue as planned.
The costs associated with these incidental operations shall not be included in the cost of the stripping activity asset.
This production measure shall be calculated for the identified component of the ore body, and shall be used as a benchmark to identify the extent to which the additional activity of creating a future benefit has taken place.
Examples of such measures include
cost of inventory produced compared with expected cost;
volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production; and
mineral content of the ore extracted compared with expected mineral content to be extracted, for a given quantity of ore produced.
Subsequent measurement of the stripping activity asset
The units of production method shall be applied unless another method is more appropriate.
For example, this might occur towards the end of a mine's useful life when the identified component represents the final part of the ore body to be extracted.
An entity shall apply this Interpretation to production stripping costs incurred on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented.
As at the beginning of the earliest period presented, any previously recognised asset balance that resulted from stripping activity undertaken during the production phase ('predecessor stripping asset') shall be reclassified as a part of an existing asset to which the stripping activity related, to the extent that there remains an identifiable component of the ore body with which the predecessor stripping asset can be associated.
Such balances shall be depreciated or amortised over the remaining expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body to which each predecessor stripping asset balance relates.
If there is no identifiable component of the ore body to which that predecessor stripping asset relates, it shall be recognised in opening retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
The same rationale applies to the fixing of exchange rates when countries join EMU at later stages.
Any resultant exchange differences shall be recognised as income or expense immediately, except that an entity shall continue to apply its existing accounting policy for exchange gains and losses related to hedges of the currency risk of a forecast transaction;

B   Definition of an insurance contract
In particular, this IFRS requires
limited improvements to accounting by insurers for insurance contracts.
disclosure that identifies and explains the amounts in an insurer's financial statements arising from insurance contracts and helps users of those financial statements understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows from insurance contracts.
insurance contracts (including reinsurance contracts) that it issues and reinsurance contracts that it holds.
paragraph 35B permits insurers to apply the overlay approach to designated financial assets; and
However, a cedant shall apply this IFRS to reinsurance contracts that it holds.
Accordingly, all references in this IFRS to insurance contracts also apply to reinsurance contracts.
Furthermore, those requirements also apply if the holder's ability to exercise a put option or cash surrender option is triggered by a change in such a variable (for example, a put option that can be exercised if a stock market index reaches a specified level).
In some cases, an insurer is required or permitted to unbundle those components
unbundling is required if both the following conditions are met
the insurer can measure the deposit component (including any embedded surrender options) separately (ie without considering the insurance component).
the insurer's accounting policies do not otherwise require it to recognise all obligations and rights arising from the deposit component.
unbundling is permitted, but not required, if the insurer can measure the deposit component separately as in (a)(i) but its accounting policies require it to recognise all obligations and rights arising from the deposit component, regardless of the basis used to measure those rights and obligations.
unbundling is prohibited if an insurer cannot measure the deposit component separately as in (a)(i).
That obligation arises from a deposit component.
If the cedant's accounting policies would otherwise permit it to recognise the compensation as income without recognising the resulting obligation, unbundling is required.
apply this IFRS to the insurance component.
However, this IFRS exempts an insurer from applying those criteria to its accounting policies for
reinsurance contracts that it holds.
shall not recognise as a liability any provisions for possible future claims, if those claims arise under insurance contracts that are not in existence at the end of the reporting period (such as catastrophe provisions and equalisation provisions).
shall remove an insurance liability (or a part of an insurance liability) from its statement of financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished — ie when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
income or expense from reinsurance contracts against the expense or income from the related insurance contracts.
The minimum requirements are the following
any related deferred acquisition costs; and
If it is less, the insurer shall recognise the entire difference in profit or loss and decrease the carrying amount of the related deferred acquisition costs or related intangible assets or increase the carrying amount of the relevant insurance liabilities.
there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that the cedant may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract; and
that event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the cedant will receive from the reinsurer.
An insurer's activities are predominantly connected with insurance if, and only if
the percentage of the total carrying amount of its liabilities connected with insurance (see paragraph 20E) relative to the total carrying amount of all its liabilities is
For the purposes of applying paragraph 20D(b), liabilities connected with insurance comprise
liabilities arising from contracts within the scope of this IFRS, as described in paragraph 20D(a);
liabilities that arise because the insurer issues, or fulfils obligations arising from, the contracts in (a) and (b).
Examples of such liabilities include derivatives used to mitigate risks arising from those contracts and from the assets backing those contracts, relevant tax liabilities such as the deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences on liabilities arising from those contracts, and debt instruments issued that are included in the insurer's regulatory capital.
In assessing whether it engages in a significant activity unconnected with insurance for the purposes of applying paragraph 20D(b)(ii), an insurer shall consider
only those activities from which it may earn income and incur expenses; and
quantitative or qualitative factors (or both), including publicly available information such as the industry classification that users of financial statements apply to the insurer.
is determined by the entity's senior management as a result of external or internal changes;
is significant to the entity's operations; and
is demonstrable to external parties.
a change in the entity's funding structure that in itself does not affect the activities from which the entity earns income and incurs expenses.
A plan to sell a business line could change the entity's activities and give rise to a reassessment in the future but has yet to affect the liabilities recognised on its statement of financial position.
When an entity uses the equity method to account for its investment in an associate or joint venture
The following specific issues are discussed below
At that time, it may also introduce accounting policies that require other current estimates and assumptions for the designated liabilities.
If an insurer designates liabilities for this election, it shall continue to apply current market interest rates (and, if applicable, the other current estimates and assumptions) consistently in all periods to all these liabilities until they are extinguished.
measuring insurance liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
measuring contractual rights to future investment management fees at an amount that exceeds their fair value as implied by a comparison with current fees charged by other market participants for similar services.
It is likely that the fair value at inception of those contractual rights equals the origination costs paid, unless future investment management fees and related costs are out of line with market comparables.
If those accounting policies are not uniform, an insurer may change them if the change does not make the accounting policies more diverse and also satisfies the other requirements in this IFRS.
However, if an insurer already measures its insurance contracts with sufficient prudence, it shall not introduce additional prudence.
However, there is a rebuttable presumption that an insurer's financial statements will become less relevant and reliable if it introduces an accounting policy that reflects future investment margins in the measurement of insurance contracts, unless those margins affect the contractual payments.
projecting the returns on those assets at an estimated rate of return, discounting those projected returns at a different rate and including the result in the measurement of the liability.
For example, suppose that an insurer's existing accounting policies for insurance contracts involve excessively prudent assumptions set at inception and a discount rate prescribed by a regulator without direct reference to market conditions, and ignore some embedded options and guarantees.
The insurer might make its financial statements more relevant and no less reliable by switching to a comprehensive investor-oriented basis of accounting that is widely used and involves
a reasonable (but not excessively prudent) adjustment to reflect risk and uncertainty;
a current market discount rate, even if that discount rate reflects the estimated return on the insurer's assets.
That profit margin is then attributed to different periods using a formula.
In those approaches, the discount rate affects the measurement of the liability only indirectly.
In particular, the use of a less appropriate discount rate has a limited or no effect on the measurement of the liability at inception.
However, in other approaches, the discount rate determines the measurement of the liability directly.
An insurer is permitted, but not required, to change its accounting policies so that a recognised but unrealised gain or loss on an asset affects those measurements in the same way that a realised gain or loss does.
The related adjustment to the insurance liability (or deferred acquisition costs or intangible assets) shall be recognised in other comprehensive income if, and only if, the unrealised gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
This practice is sometimes described as 'shadow accounting'.
a liability measured in accordance with the insurer's accounting policies for insurance contracts that it issues; and
The subsequent measurement of this asset shall be consistent with the measurement of the related insurance liability.
may, but need not, recognise the guaranteed element separately from the discretionary participation feature.
If the issuer does not recognise them separately, it shall classify the whole contract as a liability.
If the issuer classifies them separately, it shall classify the guaranteed element as a liability.
shall, if it recognises the discretionary participation feature separately from the guaranteed element, classify that feature as either a liability or a separate component of equity.
This IFRS does not specify how the issuer determines whether that feature is a liability or equity.
The issuer may split that feature into liability and equity components and shall use a consistent accounting policy for that split.
The issuer shall not classify that feature as an intermediate category that is neither liability nor equity.
may recognise all premiums received as revenue without separating any portion that relates to the equity component.
The resulting changes in the guaranteed element and in the portion of the discretionary participation feature classified as a liability shall be recognised in profit or loss.
If part or all of the discretionary participation feature is classified in equity, a portion of profit or loss may be attributable to that feature (in the same way that a portion may be attributable to non-controlling interests).
Furthermore, the issuer need not determine that amount if the total liability recognised is clearly higher.
although these contracts are financial instruments, the issuer may continue to recognise the premiums for those contracts as revenue and recognise as an expense the resulting increase in the carrying amount of the liability.
An insurer is permitted, but not required, to apply the overlay approach to designated financial assets.
An insurer that applies the overlay approach shall
Accordingly, the amount reclassified is equal to the difference between
An insurer shall present the amount reclassified between profit or loss and other comprehensive income applying the overlay approach
in profit or loss as a separate line item; and
in other comprehensive income as a separate component of other comprehensive income.
A financial asset is eligible for designation for the overlay approach if, and only if, the following criteria are met
it is not held in respect of an activity that is unconnected with contracts within the scope of this IFRS.
Examples of financial assets that would not be eligible for the overlay approach are those assets held in respect of banking activities or financial assets held in funds relating to investment contracts that are outside the scope of this IFRS.
An insurer may designate an eligible financial asset for the overlay approach when it elects to apply the overlay approach (see paragraph 35C).
Subsequently, it may designate an eligible financial asset for the overlay approach when, and only when
that asset is initially recognised; or
that asset newly meets the criterion in paragraph 35E(b) having previously not met that criterion.
An insurer is permitted to designate eligible financial assets for the overlay approach applying paragraph 35F on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
When relevant, for the purposes of applying the overlay approach to a newly designated financial asset applying paragraph 35F(b)
its fair value at the date of designation shall be its new amortised cost carrying amount; and
the effective interest rate shall be determined based on its fair value at the date of designation.
An entity shall continue to apply the overlay approach to a designated financial asset until that financial asset is derecognised.
shall de-designate a financial asset when the financial asset no longer meets the criterion in paragraph 35E(b).
For example, a financial asset will no longer meet that criterion when an entity transfers that asset so that it is held in respect of its banking activities or when an entity ceases to be an insurer.
When an entity de-designates a financial asset applying paragraph 35I(a), it shall reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1) any balance relating to that financial asset.
If an entity stops using the overlay approach applying the election in paragraph 35I(b) or because it is no longer an insurer, it shall not subsequently apply the overlay approach.
An insurer that has elected to apply the overlay approach (see paragraph 35C) but has no eligible financial assets (see paragraph 35E) may subsequently apply the overlay approach when it has eligible financial assets.
If an insurer applies the overlay approach, shadow accounting may be applicable.

Account for the components of a contract as if they were separate contracts.
This appendix gives guidance on the definition of an insurance contract in Appendix A. It addresses the following issues
the term 'uncertain future event' (paragraphs B2–B4);
payments in kind (paragraphs B5–B7);
insurance risk and other risks (paragraphs B8–B17);
examples of insurance contracts (paragraphs B18–B21);
changes in the level of insurance risk (paragraphs B29 and B30).
whether an insured event will occur;
how much the insurer will need to pay if it occurs.
In some insurance contracts, the insured event is the discovery of a loss during the term of the contract, even if the loss arises from an event that occurred before the inception of the contract.
Some insurance contracts cover events that have already occurred, but whose financial effect is still uncertain.
An example is a reinsurance contract that covers the direct insurer against adverse development of claims already reported by policyholders.
In such contracts, the insured event is the discovery of the ultimate cost of those claims.
An example is when the insurer replaces a stolen article directly, instead of reimbursing the policyholder.
Another example is when an insurer uses its own hospitals and medical staff to provide medical services covered by the contracts.
Some fixed-fee service contracts in which the level of service depends on an uncertain event meet the definition of an insurance contract in this IFRS but are not regulated as insurance contracts in some countries.
The fixed service fee is based on the expected number of malfunctions, but it is uncertain whether a particular machine will break down.
The malfunction of the equipment adversely affects its owner and the contract compensates the owner (in kind, rather than cash).
The latter contract could meet the definition of an insurance contract even if the provider does not agree to carry out repairs or replace parts.
Applying the IFRS to the contracts described in paragraph B6 is likely to be no more burdensome than applying the IFRSs that would be applicable if such contracts were outside the scope of this IFRS
Distinction between insurance risk and other risks
The definition of an insurance contract refers to insurance risk, which this IFRS defines as risk, other than financial risk, transferred from the holder of a contract to the issuer.
The definition of financial risk in Appendix A includes a list of financial and non-financial variables.
That list includes non-financial variables that are not specific to a party to the contract, such as an index of earthquake losses in a particular region or an index of temperatures in a particular city.
It excludes non-financial variables that are specific to a party to the contract, such as the occurrence or non-occurrence of a fire that damages or destroys an asset of that party.
Furthermore, the risk of changes in the fair value of a non-financial asset is not a financial risk if the fair value reflects not only changes in market prices for such assets (a financial variable) but also the condition of a specific non-financial asset held by a party to a contract (a non-financial variable).
For example, if a guarantee of the residual value of a specific car exposes the guarantor to the risk of changes in the car's physical condition, that risk is insurance risk, not financial risk.
Some contracts expose the issuer to financial risk, in addition to significant insurance risk.
Such contracts are insurance contracts, provided the payment that is contingent on the insured event can be significant.
The link to the price index is an embedded derivative, but it also transfers insurance risk.
The definition of insurance risk refers to risk that the insurer accepts from the policyholder.
In other words, insurance risk is a pre-existing risk transferred from the policyholder to the insurer.
Thus, a new risk created by the contract is not insurance risk.
The definition does not limit the payment by the insurer to an amount equal to the financial impact of the adverse event.
For example, the definition does not exclude 'new-for-old' coverage that pays the policyholder sufficient to permit replacement of a damaged old asset by a new asset.
Similarly, the definition does not limit payment under a term life insurance contract to the financial loss suffered by the deceased's dependants, nor does it preclude the payment of predetermined amounts to quantify the loss caused by death or an accident.
Some contracts require a payment if a specified uncertain event occurs, but do not require an adverse effect on the policyholder as a precondition for payment.
Such a contract is not an insurance contract even if the holder uses the contract to mitigate an underlying risk exposure.
For example, if the holder uses a derivative to hedge an underlying non-financial variable that is correlated with cash flows from an asset of the entity, the derivative is not an insurance contract because payment is not conditional on whether the holder is adversely affected by a reduction in the cash flows from the asset.
Conversely, the definition of an insurance contract refers to an uncertain event for which an adverse effect on the policyholder is a contractual precondition for payment.
This contractual precondition does not require the insurer to investigate whether the event actually caused an adverse effect, but permits the insurer to deny payment if it is not satisfied that the event caused an adverse effect.
Similarly, expense risk (ie the risk of unexpected increases in the administrative costs associated with the servicing of a contract, rather than in costs associated with insured events) is not insurance risk because an unexpected increase in expenses does not adversely affect the counterparty.
Therefore, a contract that exposes the issuer to lapse risk, persistency risk or expense risk is not an insurance contract unless it also exposes the issuer to insurance risk.
An insurer can accept significant insurance risk from the policyholder only if the insurer is an entity separate from the policyholder.
In the case of a mutual insurer, the mutual accepts risk from each policyholder and pools that risk.
Although policyholders bear that pooled risk collectively in their capacity as owners, the mutual has still accepted the risk that is the essence of an insurance contract.
The following are examples of contracts that are insurance contracts, if the transfer of insurance risk is significant
insurance against theft or damage to property.
credit insurance that provides for specified payments to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
These contracts could have various legal forms, such as that of a guarantee, some types of letter of credit, a credit derivative default contract or an insurance contract.
Product warranties issued by another party for goods sold by a manufacturer, dealer or retailer are within the scope of this IFRS.
insurance swaps and other contracts that require a payment based on changes in climatic, geological or other physical variables that are specific to a party to the contract.
contracts that have the legal form of insurance, but pass all significant insurance risk back to the policyholder through non-cancellable and enforceable mechanisms that adjust future payments by the policyholder as a direct result of insured losses, for example some financial reinsurance contracts or some group contracts (such contracts are normally non-insurance financial instruments or service contracts, see paragraphs B20 and B21).
contracts (such as gambling contracts) that require a payment if a specified uncertain future event occurs, but do not require, as a contractual precondition for payment, that the event adversely affects the policyholder.
a credit-related guarantee (or letter of credit, credit derivative default contract or credit insurance contract) that requires payments even if the holder has not incurred a loss on the failure of the debtor to make payments when due (see IFRS 9).
contracts that require a payment based on a climatic, geological or other physical variable that is not specific to a party to the contract (commonly described as weather derivatives).
catastrophe bonds that provide for reduced payments of principal, interest or both, based on a climatic, geological or other physical variable that is not specific to a party to the contract.
Among other things, this means that the parties to the contract use what is sometimes called deposit accounting, which involves the following
the other party recognises the consideration paid as a financial asset, rather than as an expense.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled.
Paragraphs B8–B21 discuss insurance risk.
The following paragraphs discuss the assessment of whether insurance risk is significant.
If significant additional benefits would be payable in scenarios that have commercial substance, the condition in the previous sentence may be met even if the insured event is extremely unlikely or even if the expected (ie probability-weighted) present value of contingent cash flows is a small proportion of the expected present value of all the remaining contractual cash flows.
Those additional amounts include claims handling and claims assessment costs, but exclude
the loss of the ability to charge the policyholder for future services.
For example, in an investment-linked life insurance contract, the death of the policyholder means that the insurer can no longer perform investment management services and collect a fee for doing so.
However, this economic loss for the insurer does not reflect insurance risk, just as a mutual fund manager does not take on insurance risk in relation to the possible death of the client.
Therefore, the potential loss of future investment management fees is not relevant in assessing how much insurance risk is transferred by a contract.
waiver on death of charges that would be made on cancellation or surrender.
Because the contract brought those charges into existence, the waiver of these charges does not compensate the policyholder for a pre-existing risk.
Hence, they are not relevant in assessing how much insurance risk is transferred by a contract.
Because the issuer does not accept significant insurance risk from the holder, this contract is not an insurance contract.
This contract-by-contract assessment makes it easier to classify a contract as an insurance contract.
However, if a relatively homogeneous book of small contracts is known to consist of contracts that all transfer insurance risk, an insurer need not examine each contract within that book to identify a few non-derivative contracts that transfer insignificant insurance risk.
It follows from paragraphs B23–B25 that if a contract pays a death benefit exceeding the amount payable on survival, the contract is an insurance contract unless the additional death benefit is insignificant (judged by reference to the contract rather than to an entire book of contracts).
As noted in paragraph B24(b), the waiver on death of cancellation or surrender charges is not included in this assessment if this waiver does not compensate the policyholder for a pre-existing risk.
Paragraph B23 refers to additional benefits.
These additional benefits could include a requirement to pay benefits earlier if the insured event occurs earlier and the payment is not adjusted for the time value of money.
An example is whole life insurance for a fixed amount (in other words, insurance that provides a fixed death benefit whenever the policyholder dies, with no expiry date for the cover).
The insurer will suffer a loss on those individual contracts for which policyholders die early, even if there is no overall loss on the whole book of contracts.
If an insurance contract is unbundled into a deposit component and an insurance component, the significance of insurance risk transfer is assessed by reference to the insurance component.
The significance of insurance risk transferred by an embedded derivative is assessed by reference to the embedded derivative.
Some contracts do not transfer any insurance risk to the issuer at inception, although they do transfer insurance risk at a later time.
For example, consider a contract that provides a specified investment return and includes an option for the policyholder to use the proceeds of the investment on maturity to buy a life-contingent annuity at the current annuity rates charged by the insurer to other new annuitants when the policyholder exercises the option.
The contract transfers no insurance risk to the issuer until the option is exercised, because the insurer remains free to price the annuity on a basis that reflects the insurance risk transferred to the insurer at that time.
However, if the contract specifies the annuity rates (or a basis for setting the annuity rates), the contract transfers insurance risk to the issuer at inception.
A contract that qualifies as an insurance contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.
CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY AS INVESTMENT PROPERTY OR OWNER-OCCUPIED PROPERTY
Fair value model and cost model
Investment property is property (land or a building — or part of a building — or both) held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for
sale in the ordinary course of business.
Owner-occupied property is property held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
Classification of property as investment property or owner-occupied property
Therefore, an investment property generates cash flows largely independently of the other assets held by an entity.
This distinguishes investment property from owner-occupied property.
The production or supply of goods or services (or the use of property for administrative purposes) generates cash flows that are attributable not only to property, but also to other assets used in the production or supply process.
land held for long-term capital appreciation rather than for short-term sale in the ordinary course of business.
a building owned by the entity (or a right-of-use asset relating to a building held by the entity) and leased out under one or more operating leases.
a building that is vacant but is held to be leased out under one or more operating leases.
property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property.
property that is leased to another entity under a finance lease.
If these portions could be sold separately (or leased out separately under a finance lease), an entity accounts for the portions separately.
If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is investment property only if an insignificant portion is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
An entity treats such a property as investment property if the services are insignificant to the arrangement as a whole.
An example is when the owner of an office building provides security and maintenance services to the lessees who occupy the building.
For example, if an entity owns and manages a hotel, services provided to guests are significant to the arrangement as a whole.
Therefore, an owner-managed hotel is owner-occupied property, rather than investment property.
The terms of such contracts vary widely.
Paragraph 75(c) requires an entity to disclose these criteria when classification is difficult.
The property does not qualify as investment property in the consolidated financial statements, because the property is owner-occupied from the perspective of the group.
Therefore, the lessor treats the property as investment property in its individual financial statements.
the cost of the investment property can be measured reliably.
These costs include costs incurred initially to acquire an investment property and costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service a property.
The purpose of these expenditures is often described as for the 'repairs and maintenance' of the property.
For example, the interior walls may be replacements of original walls.
Under the recognition principle, an entity recognises in the carrying amount of an investment property the cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met.
The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with the derecognition provisions of this Standard.
Transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement.
Directly attributable expenditure includes, for example, professional fees for legal services, property transfer taxes and other transaction costs.
start-up costs (unless they are necessary to bring the property to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management)
abnormal amounts of wasted material, labour or other resources incurred in constructing or developing the property.
The difference between this amount and the total payments is recognised as interest expense over the period of credit.
The cost of such an investment property is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable.
The acquired asset is measured in this way even if an entity cannot immediately derecognise the asset given up.
If the acquired asset is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up.
If the entity is able to measure reliably the fair value of either the asset received or the asset given up, then the fair value of the asset given up is used to measure cost unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident.
It is highly unlikely that a change from the fair value model to the cost model will result in a more relevant presentation.
An entity is encouraged, but not required, to measure the fair value of investment property on the basis of a valuation by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued.
choose either the fair value model or the cost model for all investment property backing liabilities that pay a return linked directly to the fair value of, or returns from, specified assets including that investment property; and
choose either the fair value model or the cost model for all other investment property, regardless of the choice made in (a).
Some insurers and other entities operate an internal property fund that issues notional units, with some units held by investors in linked contracts and others held by the entity.
Paragraph 32A does not permit an entity to measure the property held by the fund partly at cost and partly at fair value.
Accordingly, if an investment property is sold from a pool in which the fair value model is used into a pool in which the cost model is used, the property's fair value at the date of the sale becomes its deemed cost.
When a lessee uses the fair value model to measure an investment property that is held as a right-of-use asset, it shall measure the right-of-use asset, and not the underlying property, at fair value.
This could occur when an election to apply the fair value model is made after initial recognition.
equipment such as lifts or air-conditioning is often an integral part of a building and is generally included in the fair value of the investment property, rather than recognised separately as property, plant and equipment.
if an office is leased on a furnished basis, the fair value of the office generally includes the fair value of the furniture, because the rental income relates to the furnished office.
When furniture is included in the fair value of investment property, an entity does not recognise that furniture as a separate asset.
the fair value of investment property excludes prepaid or accrued operating lease income, because the entity recognises it as a separate liability or asset.
the fair value of investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset reflects expected cash flows (including variable lease payments that are expected to become payable).
Accordingly, if a valuation obtained for a property is net of all payments expected to be made, it will be necessary to add back any recognised lease liability, to arrive at the carrying amount of the investment property using the fair value model.
However, in exceptional cases, there is clear evidence when an entity first acquires an investment property (or when an existing property first becomes investment property after a change in use) that the fair value of the investment property is not reliably measurable on a continuing basis.
This arises when, and only when, the market for comparable properties is inactive (eg there are few recent transactions, price quotations are not current or observed transaction prices indicate that the seller was forced to sell) and alternative reliable measurements of fair value (for example, based on discounted cash flow projections) are not available.
If an entity determines that the fair value of an investment property under construction is not reliably measurable but expects the fair value of the property to be reliably measurable when construction is complete, it shall measure that investment property under construction at cost until either its fair value becomes reliably measurable or construction is completed (whichever is earlier).
Once an entity becomes able to measure reliably the fair value of an investment property under construction that has previously been measured at cost, it shall measure that property at its fair value.
Once construction of that property is complete, it is presumed that fair value can be measured reliably.
The presumption that the fair value of investment property under construction can be measured reliably can be rebutted only on initial recognition.
An entity that has measured an item of investment property under construction at fair value may not conclude that the fair value of the completed investment property cannot be measured reliably.
A change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use.
In isolation, a change in management's intentions for the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change in use.
Examples of evidence of a change in use include
commencement of owner-occupation, or of development with a view to owner-occupation, for a transfer from investment property to owner-occupied property;
commencement of development with a view to sale, for a transfer from investment property to inventories;
inception of an operating lease to another party, for a transfer from inventories to investment property.
Similarly, if an entity begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property, the property remains an investment property and is not reclassified as owner-occupied property during the redevelopment.
When an entity uses the cost model, transfers between investment property, owner-occupied property and inventories do not change the carrying amount of the property transferred and they do not change the cost of that property for measurement or disclosure purposes.
any resulting decrease in the carrying amount of the property is recognised in profit or loss.
However, to the extent that an amount is included in revaluation surplus for that property, the decrease is recognised in other comprehensive income and reduces the revaluation surplus within equity.
any resulting increase in the carrying amount is treated as follows
to the extent that the increase reverses a previous impairment loss for that property, the increase is recognised in profit or loss.
The amount recognised in profit or loss does not exceed the amount needed to restore the carrying amount to the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised.
any remaining part of the increase is recognised in other comprehensive income and increases the revaluation surplus within equity.
On subsequent disposal of the investment property, the revaluation surplus included in equity may be transferred to retained earnings.
The transfer from revaluation surplus to retained earnings is not made through profit or loss.
For investment property accounted for using the cost model, a replaced part may not be a part that was depreciated separately.
Under the fair value model, the fair value of the investment property may already reflect that the part to be replaced has lost its value.
In other cases it may be difficult to discern how much fair value should be reduced for the part being replaced.
An alternative to reducing fair value for the replaced part, when it is not practical to do so, is to include the cost of the replacement in the carrying amount of the asset and then to reassess the fair value, as would be required for additions not involving replacement.

Consequently, accounting for acquisitions of investment property in prior periods shall not be adjusted.

For example, costs the acquirer expects but is not obliged to incur in the future to effect its plan to exit an activity of an acquiree or to terminate the employment of or relocate an acquiree's employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date.
Therefore, the acquirer does not recognise those costs as part of applying the acquisition method.
Instead, the acquirer recognises those costs in its post-combination financial statements in accordance with other IFRSs.
Paragraphs 21A-28B specify the types of identifiable assets and liabilities that include items for which this IFRS provides limited exceptions to the recognition principle and conditions.

Exceptions to the recognition principle
The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting defines a liability as 'a present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events'.
A present obligation identified in accordance with paragraph 21B might meet the definition of a contingent liability set out in paragraph 22(b).

The acquirer shall not recognise a contingent asset at the acquisition date.
Preface to the CPA Canada Handbook – Accounting
This Preface explains the applicability of the Handbook to entities that prepare financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Requirements for an entity to prepare and issue financial statements are established by the laws and regulations applicable to the entity or by contract.

Other entities may also hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders because they hold and manage financial resources entrusted to them by clients, customers or members not involved in the management of the entity.
However, if they do so for reasons incidental to a primary business (as, for example, may be the case for travel or real estate agents, co-operative enterprises requiring a nominal membership deposit, or sellers that receive payment in advance of delivery of the goods or services, such as utility companies), that does not make them publicly accountable.
The standards set out in each of the Parts of the Handbook are based on common, but not identical, conceptual frameworks.
When exercising judgment, an entity refers to the framework relating to the standards in the Part it is applying.

Estimates used to measure recoverable amounts of cash-generating units containing goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
TRANSITION PROVISIONS AND EFFECTIVE DATE
An asset is carried at more than its recoverable amount if its carrying amount exceeds the amount to be recovered through use or sale of the asset.
If this is the case, the asset is described as impaired and the Standard requires the entity to recognise an impairment loss.
The Standard also specifies when an entity should reverse an impairment loss and prescribes disclosures.
The only difference between an asset's fair value and its fair value less costs of disposal is the direct incremental costs attributable to the disposal of the asset.
In this case, after the revaluation requirements have been applied, it is unlikely that the revalued asset is impaired and recoverable amount need not be estimated.
Therefore, the revalued asset will be impaired if its value in use is less than its revalued amount.
In this case, after the revaluation requirements have been applied, an entity applies this Standard to determine whether the asset may be impaired.
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Corporate assets are assets other than goodwill that contribute to the future cash flows of both the cash-generating unit under review and other cash-generating units.
Costs of disposal are incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset or cash-generating unit, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.
Depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost in the financial statements, less its residual value.
An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the entity.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit.
Identifying an asset that may be impaired
These requirements use the term 'an asset' but apply equally to an individual asset or a cash-generating unit.
The remainder of this Standard is structured as follows
These requirements also use the term 'an asset' but apply equally to an individual asset and a cash-generating unit.
Again, these requirements use the term 'an asset' but apply equally to an individual asset or a cash-generating unit.
If any of those indications is present, an entity is required to make a formal estimate of recoverable amount.
If any such indication exists, the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset.
Different intangible assets may be tested for impairment at different times.
These changes include the asset becoming idle, plans to discontinue or restructure the operation to which an asset belongs, plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date, and reassessing the useful life of an asset as finite rather than indefinite].
Dividend from a subsidiary, joint venture or associate
the carrying amount of the investment in the separate financial statements exceeds the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the investee's net assets, including associated goodwill; or
the dividend exceeds the total comprehensive income of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate in the period the dividend is declared.
actual net cash flows or operating profit or loss flowing from the asset that are significantly worse than those budgeted;
operating losses or net cash outflows for the asset, when current period amounts are aggregated with budgeted amounts for the future.
For example, if previous calculations show that an asset's recoverable amount is significantly greater than its carrying amount, the entity need not re-estimate the asset's recoverable amount if no events have occurred that would eliminate that difference.
if the discount rate used in calculating the asset's value in use is unlikely to be affected by the increase in these market rates.
For example, increases in short-term interest rates may not have a material effect on the discount rate used for an asset that has a long remaining useful life.
if the discount rate used in calculating the asset's value in use is likely to be affected by the increase in these market rates but previous sensitivity analysis of recoverable amount shows that
it is unlikely that there will be a material decrease in recoverable amount because future cash flows are also likely to increase (eg in some cases, an entity may be able to demonstrate that it adjusts its revenues to compensate for any increase in market rates); or
the decrease in recoverable amount is unlikely to result in a material impairment loss.
If either of these amounts exceeds the asset's carrying amount, the asset is not impaired and it is not necessary to estimate the other amount.
However, sometimes it will not be possible to measure fair value less costs of disposal because there is no basis for making a reliable estimate of the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.
In this case, the entity may use the asset's value in use as its recoverable amount.
This will often be the case for an asset that is held for disposal.
This is because the value in use of an asset held for disposal will consist mainly of the net disposal proceeds, as the future cash flows from continuing use of the asset until its disposal are likely to be negligible.
the asset's value in use can be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs of disposal and fair value less costs of disposal can be measured.
However, the most recent detailed calculation of such an asset's recoverable amount made in a preceding period may be used in the impairment test for that asset in the current period, provided all of the following criteria are met
if the intangible asset does not generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and is therefore tested for impairment as part of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs, the assets and liabilities making up that unit have not changed significantly since the most recent recoverable amount calculation;
based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent recoverable amount calculation, the likelihood that a current recoverable amount determination would be less than the asset's carrying amount is remote.
Examples of such costs are legal costs, stamp duty and similar transaction taxes, costs of removing the asset, and direct incremental costs to bring an asset into condition for its sale.
However, termination benefits (as defined in IAS 19) and costs associated with reducing or reorganising a business following the disposal of an asset are not direct incremental costs to dispose of the asset.
an estimate of the future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset;
expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those future cash flows;
the time value of money, represented by the current market risk-free rate of interest;
applying the appropriate discount rate to those future cash flows.
Whichever approach an entity adopts to reflect expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of future cash flows, the result shall be to reflect the expected present value of the future cash flows, ie the weighted average of all possible outcomes.
Appendix A provides additional guidance on the use of present value techniques in measuring an asset's value in use.
base cash flow projections on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's best estimate of the range of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the asset.
Greater weight shall be given to external evidence.
base cash flow projections on the most recent financial budgets / forecasts approved by management, but shall exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings or from improving or enhancing the asset's performance.
This growth rate shall not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market in which the asset is used, unless a higher rate can be justified.
Management shall ensure that the assumptions on which its current cash flow projections are based are consistent with past actual outcomes, provided the effects of subsequent events or circumstances that did not exist when those actual cash flows were generated make this appropriate.
This rate is steady or declining, unless an increase in the rate matches objective information about patterns over a product or industry lifecycle.
projections of cash inflows from the continuing use of the asset;
net cash flows, if any, to be received (or paid) for the disposal of the asset at the end of its useful life.
Therefore, if the discount rate includes the effect of price increases attributable to general inflation, future cash flows are estimated in nominal terms.
If the discount rate excludes the effect of price increases attributable to general inflation, future cash flows are estimated in real terms (but include future specific price increases or decreases).
For example, this is the case for a building under construction or for a development project that is not yet completed.
cash outflows that relate to obligations that have been recognised as liabilities (for example, payables, pensions or provisions).
Estimates of future cash flows shall not include estimated future cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from
improving or enhancing the asset's performance.
Once the entity is committed to the restructuring
income tax receipts or payments.
Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be counted twice or ignored.
Because the time value of money is considered by discounting the estimated future cash flows, these cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows from financing activities.
Similarly, because the discount rate is determined on a pre-tax basis, future cash flows are also estimated on a pre-tax basis.
an entity uses prices prevailing at the date of the estimate for similar assets that have reached the end of their useful life and have operated under conditions similar to those in which the asset will be used.
the entity adjusts those prices for the effect of both future price increases due to general inflation and specific future price increases or decreases.
However, if estimates of future cash flows from the asset's continuing use and the discount rate exclude the effect of general inflation, the entity also excludes this effect from the estimate of net cash flows on disposal.
Fair value differs from value in use.
Fair value reflects the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset.
In contrast, value in use reflects the effects of factors that may be specific to the entity and not applicable to entities in general.
For example, fair value does not reflect any of the following factors to the extent that they would not be generally available to market participants
additional value derived from the grouping of assets (such as the creation of a portfolio of investment properties in different locations);
synergies between the asset being measured and other assets;
legal rights or legal restrictions that are specific only to the current owner of the asset; and
tax benefits or tax burdens that are specific to the current owner of the asset.
An entity translates the present value using the spot exchange rate at the date of the value in use calculation.
This rate is estimated from the rate implicit in current market transactions for similar assets or from the weighted average cost of capital of a listed entity that has a single asset (or a portfolio of assets) similar in terms of service potential and risks to the asset under review.
Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be double-counted.
Appendix A provides additional guidance on estimating the discount rate in such circumstances.
Recognising and measuring an impairment loss
That reduction is an impairment loss.
Any impairment loss of a revalued asset shall be treated as a revaluation decrease in accordance with that other Standard.
However, an impairment loss on a revalued asset is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the amount in the revaluation surplus for that same asset.
Such an impairment loss on a revalued asset reduces the revaluation surplus for that asset.
If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, an entity shall determine the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs (the asset's cash-generating unit).
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets.
In such cases, value in use and, therefore, recoverable amount, can be determined only for the asset's cash-generating unit.
A mining entity owns a private railway to support its mining activities.
The private railway could be sold only for scrap value and it does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from the other assets of the mine.
It is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the private railway because its value in use cannot be determined and is probably different from scrap value.
Therefore, the entity estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the private railway belongs, ie the mine as a whole.
Identification of an asset's cash-generating unit involves judgement.
If recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, an entity identifies the lowest aggregation of assets that generate largely independent cash inflows.
Assets devoted to each route and the cash flows from each route can be identified separately.
The cash-generating unit for each route is the bus company as a whole.
In identifying whether cash inflows from an asset (or group of assets) are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets (or groups of assets), an entity considers various factors including how management monitors the entity's operations (such as by product lines, businesses, individual locations, districts or regional areas) or how management makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entity's assets and operations.
the future cash outflows used to determine the value in use of any other assets or cash-generating units that are affected by the internal transfer pricing.
This is because the asset or group of assets could generate cash inflows that would be largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
In using information based on financial budgets / forecasts that relates to such a cash-generating unit, or to any other asset or cash-generating unit affected by internal transfer pricing, an entity adjusts this information if internal transfer prices do not reflect management's best estimate of future prices that could be achieved in arm's length transactions.
does not include the carrying amount of any recognised liability, unless the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit cannot be determined without consideration of this liability.
Otherwise, the cash-generating unit may appear to be fully recoverable when in fact an impairment loss has occurred.
In some cases, although some assets contribute to the estimated future cash flows of a cash-generating unit, they cannot be allocated to the cash-generating unit on a reasonable and consistent basis.
This might be the case for goodwill or corporate assets such as head office assets.
This may occur if the disposal of a cash-generating unit would require the buyer to assume the liability.
In this case, the fair value less costs of disposal (or the estimated cash flow from ultimate disposal) of the cash-generating unit is the price to sell the assets of the cash-generating unit and the liability together, less the costs of disposal.
To perform a meaningful comparison between the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit and its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the liability is deducted in determining both the cash-generating unit's value in use and its carrying amount.
A company operates a mine in a country where legislation requires that the owner must restore the site on completion of its mining operations.
The cost of restoration includes the replacement of the overburden, which must be removed before mining operations commence.
A provision for the costs to replace the overburden was recognised as soon as the overburden was removed.
The amount provided was recognised as part of the cost of the mine and is being depreciated over the mine's useful life.
The entity is testing the mine for impairment.
The cash-generating unit for the mine is the mine as a whole.
This price reflects the fact that the buyer will assume the obligation to restore the overburden.
Disposal costs for the mine are negligible.
This amount considers restoration costs that have already been provided for.
Therefore, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit exceeds its carrying amount.
In such cases, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is increased by the carrying amount of those assets and decreased by the carrying amount of those liabilities.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated shall
Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets, and often contributes to the cash flows of multiple cash-generating units.
Goodwill sometimes cannot be allocated on a non-arbitrary basis to individual cash-generating units, but only to groups of cash-generating units.
As a result, the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes sometimes comprises a number of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates, but to which it cannot be allocated.
measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained, unless the entity can demonstrate that some other method better reflects the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of.
The goodwill allocated to the unit cannot be identified or associated with an asset group at a level lower than that unit, except arbitrarily.
Because the goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit cannot be non-arbitrarily identified or associated with an asset group at a level lower than that unit, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the unit retained.
This reallocation shall be performed using a relative value approach similar to that used when an entity disposes of an operation within a cash-generating unit, unless the entity can demonstrate that some other method better reflects the goodwill associated with the reorganised units.
If the recoverable amount of the unit exceeds the carrying amount of the unit, the unit and the goodwill allocated to that unit shall be regarded as not impaired.
Different cash-generating units may be tested for impairment at different times.
Similarly, if the cash-generating units constituting a group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at the same time as the group of units containing the goodwill, the individual units shall be tested for impairment before the group of units containing the goodwill.
Similarly, there may be an indication of an impairment of a cash-generating unit within a group of units containing the goodwill.
the assets and liabilities making up the unit have not changed significantly since the most recent recoverable amount calculation;
based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent recoverable amount calculation, the likelihood that a current recoverable amount determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the unit is remote.
The structure of an entity determines whether an asset meets this Standard's definition of corporate assets for a particular cash-generating unit.
The distinctive characteristics of corporate assets are that they do not generate cash inflows independently of other assets or groups of assets and their carrying amount cannot be fully attributed to the cash-generating unit under review.
As a consequence, if there is an indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units to which the corporate asset belongs, and is compared with the carrying amount of this cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units.
If a portion of the carrying amount of a corporate asset
can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to that unit, the entity shall compare the carrying amount of the unit, including the portion of the carrying amount of the corporate asset allocated to the unit, with its recoverable amount.
cannot be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to that unit, the entity shall
(iii) compare the carrying amount of that group of cash-generating units, including the portion of the carrying amount of the corporate asset allocated to that group of units, with the recoverable amount of the group of units.
The impairment loss shall be allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the unit (group of units) in the following order
its fair value less costs of disposal (if measurable);
no impairment loss is recognised for the asset if the related cash-generating unit is not impaired.
This applies even if the asset's fair value less costs of disposal is less than its carrying amount.
A machine has suffered physical damage but is still working, although not as well as before it was damaged.
The machine's fair value less costs of disposal is less than its carrying amount.
The machine does not generate independent cash inflows.
The smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the machine and generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets is the production line to which the machine belongs.
The recoverable amount of the production line shows that the production line taken as a whole is not impaired.
The recoverable amount of the machine alone cannot be estimated because the machine's value in use
(b)  can be determined only for the cash-generating unit to which the machine belongs (the production line).
The production line is not impaired.
Therefore, no impairment loss is recognised for the machine.
Nevertheless, the entity may need to reassess the depreciation period or the depreciation method for the machine.
Perhaps a shorter depreciation period or a faster depreciation method is required to reflect the expected remaining useful life of the machine or the pattern in which economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity.
Cash flows from continuing use of the machine until its disposal are estimated to be negligible.
The machine's value in use can be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs of disposal.
Therefore, the recoverable amount of the machine can be determined and no consideration is given to the cash-generating unit to which the machine belongs (ie the production line).
Because the machine's fair value less costs of disposal is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised for the machine.
If any such indication exists, the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of that asset.
These changes include costs incurred during the period to improve or enhance the asset's performance or restructure the operation to which the asset belongs.
Examples of changes in estimates include
a change in the basis for recoverable amount (ie whether recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal or value in use);
if recoverable amount was based on fair value less costs of disposal, a change in estimate of the components of fair value less costs of disposal.
However, the service potential of the asset has not increased.
Therefore, an impairment loss is not reversed just because of the passage of time (sometimes called the 'unwinding' of the discount), even if the recoverable amount of the asset becomes higher than its carrying amount.
Any reversal of an impairment loss of a revalued asset shall be treated as a revaluation increase in accordance with that other IFRS.
However, to the extent that an impairment loss on the same revalued asset was previously recognised in profit or loss, a reversal of that impairment loss is also recognised in profit or loss.
the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
The amount of the reversal of the impairment loss that would otherwise have been allocated to the asset shall be allocated pro rata to the other assets of the unit, except for goodwill.
Any increase in the recoverable amount of goodwill in the periods following the recognition of an impairment loss for that goodwill is likely to be an increase in internally generated goodwill, rather than a reversal of the impairment loss recognised for the acquired goodwill.

Using present value techniques to measure value in use
It provides guidance on the use of present value techniques in measuring value in use.
Although the guidance uses the term 'asset', it equally applies to a group of assets forming a cash-generating unit.
The components of a present value measurement
The following elements together capture the economic differences between assets
an estimate of the future cash flow, or in more complex cases, series of future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset;
expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those cash flows;
other, sometimes unidentifiable, factors (such as illiquidity) that market participants would reflect in pricing the future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset.
Under the 'traditional' approach, adjustments for factors (b)–(e) described in paragraph A1 are embedded in the discount rate.
Under the 'expected cash flow' approach, factors (b), (d) and (e) cause adjustments in arriving at risk-adjusted expected cash flows.
Whichever approach an entity adopts to reflect expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of future cash flows, the result should be to reflect the expected present value of the future cash flows, ie the weighted average of all possible outcomes.
However, the following general principles govern any application of present value techniques in measuring assets
interest rates used to discount cash flows should reflect assumptions that are consistent with those inherent in the estimated cash flows.
Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be double-counted or ignored.
That rate reflects expectations about future defaults from loans with particular characteristics.
estimated cash flows and discount rates should be free from both bias and factors unrelated to the asset in question.
For example, deliberately understating estimated net cash flows to enhance the apparent future profitability of an asset introduces a bias into the measurement.
estimated cash flows or discount rates should reflect the range of possible outcomes rather than a single most likely, minimum or maximum possible amount.
Traditional and expected cash flow approaches to present value
Accounting applications of present value have traditionally used a single set of estimated cash flows and a single discount rate, often described as 'the rate commensurate with the risk'.
In effect, the traditional approach assumes that a single discount rate convention can incorporate all the expectations about the future cash flows and the appropriate risk premium.
Therefore, the traditional approach places most of the emphasis on selection of the discount rate.
In some circumstances, such as those in which comparable assets can be observed in the marketplace, a traditional approach is relatively easy to apply.
However, the traditional approach may not appropriately address some complex measurement problems, such as the measurement of non-financial assets for which no market for the item or a comparable item exists.
The appropriate discount rate for the cash flows being measured must be inferred from the observable rate of interest in that other asset.
To draw that inference, the characteristics of the other asset's cash flows must be similar to those of the asset being measured.
Therefore, the measurer must do the following
identify the set of cash flows that will be discounted;
identify another asset in the marketplace that appears to have similar cash flow characteristics;
evaluate whether both sets of cash flows are likely to behave (ie vary) in a similar fashion in changing economic conditions.
The expected cash flow approach is, in some situations, a more effective measurement tool than the traditional approach.
In developing a measurement, the expected cash flow approach uses all expectations about possible cash flows instead of the single most likely cash flow.
The expected cash flow approach thus differs from the traditional approach by focusing on direct analysis of the cash flows in question and on more explicit statements of the assumptions used in the measurement.
The expected cash flow approach also allows use of present value techniques when the timing of cash flows is uncertain.
The example below shows the computation of expected present value in that situation.
A traditional present value computation applied to this example requires a decision about which of the possible timings of cash flows to use and, accordingly, would not reflect the probabilities of other timings.
This is because the discount rate in a traditional present value computation cannot reflect uncertainties in timing.
The use of probabilities is an essential element of the expected cash flow approach.
Some question whether assigning probabilities to highly subjective estimates suggests greater precision than, in fact, exists.
However, the proper application of the traditional approach (as described in paragraph A6) requires the same estimates and subjectivity without providing the computational transparency of the expected cash flow approach.
Many estimates developed in current practice already incorporate the elements of expected cash flows informally.
In addition, accountants often face the need to measure an asset using limited information about the probabilities of possible cash flows.
For example, an accountant might be confronted with the following situations
However, the probabilities attached to each amount are unknown.
In each case, the estimated expected cash flow is likely to provide a better estimate of value in use than the minimum, most likely or maximum amount taken alone.
The application of an expected cash flow approach is subject to a cost-benefit constraint.
In some cases, an entity may have access to extensive data and may be able to develop many cash flow scenarios.
In other cases, an entity may not be able to develop more than general statements about the variability of cash flows without incurring substantial cost.
The entity needs to balance the cost of obtaining additional information against the additional reliability that information will bring to the measurement.
Some maintain that expected cash flow techniques are inappropriate for measuring a single item or an item with a limited number of possible outcomes.
Assertions like the one just outlined reflect underlying disagreement with the measurement objective.
If the objective is accumulation of costs to be incurred, expected cash flows may not produce a representationally faithful estimate of the expected cost.
However, this Standard is concerned with measuring the recoverable amount of an asset.
Instead, the uncertain cash flow is presented as if it were a certain cash flow.
Whichever approach an entity adopts for measuring the value in use of an asset, interest rates used to discount cash flows should not reflect risks for which the estimated cash flows have been adjusted.
When an asset-specific rate is not directly available from the market, an entity uses surrogates to estimate the discount rate.
The purpose is to estimate, as far as possible, a market assessment of
factors (b), (d) and (e) described in paragraph A1, to the extent those factors have not caused adjustments in arriving at estimated cash flows.
As a starting point in making such an estimate, the entity might take into account the following rates
However, these rates must be adjusted
to exclude risks that are not relevant to the asset's estimated cash flows or for which the estimated cash flows have been adjusted.
Consideration should be given to risks such as country risk, currency risk and price risk.
The discount rate is independent of the entity's capital structure and the way the entity financed the purchase of the asset, because the future cash flows expected to arise from an asset do not depend on the way in which the entity financed the purchase of the asset.
Therefore, when the basis used to estimate the discount rate is post-tax, that basis is adjusted to reflect a pre-tax rate.
An entity normally uses a single discount rate for the estimate of an asset's value in use.
However, an entity uses separate discount rates for different future periods where value in use is sensitive to a difference in risks for different periods or to the term structure of interest rates.
Impairment testing cash-generating units with goodwill and non-controlling interests
the consideration transferred measured in accordance with IFRS 3, which generally requires acquisition-date fair value;
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance with IFRS 3; and
(iii) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree.
It is possible that some of the synergies resulting from a business combination will be allocated to a cash-generating unit in which the non-controlling interest does not have an interest.
If an entity measures non-controlling interests as its proportionate interest in the net identifiable assets of a subsidiary at the acquisition date, rather than at fair value, goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests is included in the recoverable amount of the related cash-generating unit but is not recognised in the parent's consolidated financial statements.
As a consequence, an entity shall gross up the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest.
This adjusted carrying amount is then compared with the recoverable amount of the unit to determine whether the cash-generating unit is impaired.
If a subsidiary, or part of a subsidiary, with a non-controlling interest is itself a cash-generating unit, the impairment loss is allocated between the parent and the non-controlling interest on the same basis as that on which profit or loss is allocated.
If a subsidiary, or part of a subsidiary, with a non-controlling interest is part of a larger cash-generating unit, goodwill impairment losses are allocated to the parts of the cash-generating unit that have a non-controlling interest and the parts that do not.
The impairment losses should be allocated to the parts of the cash-generating unit on the basis of
to the extent that the impairment relates to identifiable assets in the cash-generating unit, the relative carrying values of the net identifiable assets of the parts before the impairment.
Any such impairment is allocated to the assets of the parts of each unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the part.
In those parts that have a non-controlling interest, the impairment loss is allocated between the parent and the non-controlling interest on the same basis as that on which profit or loss is allocated.
If an impairment loss attributable to a non-controlling interest relates to goodwill that is not recognised in the parent's consolidated financial statements (see paragraph C4), that impairment is not recognised as a goodwill impairment loss.
In such cases, only the impairment loss relating to the goodwill that is allocated to the parent is recognised as a goodwill impairment loss.
accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors
Selection and application of accounting policies
Applying changes in accounting policies
Disclosure of prior period errors
The Standard is intended to enhance the relevance and reliability of an entity's financial statements, and the comparability of those financial statements over time and with the financial statements of other entities.
Accounting policies are the specific principles, bases, conventions, rules and practices applied by an entity in preparing and presenting financial statements.
A change in accounting estimate is an adjustment of the carrying amount of an asset or a liability, or the amount of the periodic consumption of an asset, that results from the assessment of the present status of, and expected future benefits and obligations associated with, assets and liabilities.
Changes in accounting estimates result from new information or new developments and, accordingly, are not corrections of errors.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) are Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
could reasonably be expected to have been obtained and taken into account in the preparation and presentation of those financial statements.
Such errors include the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying accounting policies, oversights or misinterpretations of facts, and fraud.
Retrospective application is applying a new accounting policy to transactions, other events and conditions as if that policy had always been applied.
Retrospective restatement is correcting the recognition, measurement and disclosure of amounts of elements of financial statements as if a prior period error had never occurred.
For a particular prior period, it is impracticable to apply a change in an accounting policy retrospectively or to make a retrospective restatement to correct an error if
the effects of the retrospective application or retrospective restatement are not determinable;
the retrospective application or retrospective restatement requires significant estimates of amounts and it is impossible to distinguish objectively information about those estimates that
would have been available when the financial statements for that prior period were authorised for issue from other information.
Prospective application of a change in accounting policy and of recognising the effect of a change in an accounting estimate, respectively, are
recognising the effect of the change in the accounting estimate in the current and future periods affected by the change.
Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.
All such guidance states whether it is an integral part of IFRSs.
Guidance that is an integral part of the IFRSs is mandatory.
Guidance that is not an integral part of the IFRSs does not contain requirements for financial statements.

when an entity changes an accounting policy upon initial application of an IFRS that does not include specific transitional provisions applying to that change, or changes an accounting policy voluntarily, it shall apply the change retrospectively.
If, following an amendment of such a pronouncement, the entity chooses to change an accounting policy, that change is accounted for and disclosed as a voluntary change in accounting policy.
Retrospective application to a prior period is not practicable unless it is practicable to determine the cumulative effect on the amounts in both the opening and closing statements of financial position for that period.
The amount of the resulting adjustment relating to periods before those presented in the financial statements is made to the opening balance of each affected component of equity of the earliest prior period presented.
Usually the adjustment is made to retained earnings.
However, the adjustment may be made to another component of equity (for example, to comply with an IFRS).
Any other information about prior periods, such as historical summaries of financial data, is also adjusted as far back as is practicable.
It therefore disregards the portion of the cumulative adjustment to assets, liabilities and equity arising before that date.
Changing an accounting policy is permitted even if it is impracticable to apply the policy prospectively for any prior period.

if that impact is not known or reasonably estimable, a statement to that effect.
Estimation involves judgements based on the latest available, reliable information.
For example, estimates may be required of
the fair value of financial assets or financial liabilities;
the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both.
A change in an accounting estimate may affect only the current period's profit or loss, or the profit or loss of both the current period and future periods.
For example, a change in the estimate of the amount of bad debts affects only the current period's profit or loss and therefore is recognised in the current period.
However, a change in the estimated useful life of, or the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in, a depreciable asset affects depreciation expense for the current period and for each future period during the asset's remaining useful life.
In both cases, the effect of the change relating to the current period is recognised as income or expense in the current period.
The effect, if any, on future periods is recognised as income or expense in those future periods.
Financial statements do not comply with IFRSs if they contain either material errors or immaterial errors made intentionally to achieve a particular presentation of an entity's financial position, financial performance or cash flows.

Impracticability in respect of retrospective application and retrospective restatement
Estimation is inherently subjective, and estimates may be developed after the reporting period.
Developing estimates is potentially more difficult when retrospectively applying an accounting policy or making a retrospective restatement to correct a prior period error, because of the longer period of time that might have passed since the affected transaction, other event or condition occurred.
However, the objective of estimates related to prior periods remains the same as for estimates made in the current period, namely, for the estimate to reflect the circumstances that existed when the transaction, other event or condition occurred.

The fact that significant estimates are frequently required when amending comparative information presented for prior periods does not prevent reliable adjustment or correction of the comparative information.
A rate regulator is an authorised body that is empowered by statute or regulation to establish the rate or a range of rates that bind an entity.
Fair value at initial recognition
sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value; and
requires disclosures about fair value measurements.
For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market information might be available.
Because fair value is a market-based measurement, it is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
As a result, an entity's intention to hold an asset or to settle or otherwise fulfil a liability is not relevant when measuring fair value.
In addition, this IFRS shall be applied to an entity's own equity instruments measured at fair value.
A fair value measurement is for a particular asset or liability.
Therefore, when measuring fair value an entity shall take into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
the condition and location of the asset; and
restrictions, if any, on the sale or use of the asset.
a group of assets, a group of liabilities or a group of assets and liabilities (eg a cash-generating unit or a business).
The unit of account for the asset or liability shall be determined in accordance with the IFRS that requires or permits the fair value measurement, except as provided in this IFRS.
A fair value measurement assumes that the asset or liability is exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date under current market conditions.
A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either
in the principal market for the asset or liability; or
in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the market in which the entity would normally enter into a transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability is presumed to be the principal market or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market.
Because different entities (and businesses within those entities) with different activities may have access to different markets, the principal (or most advantageous) market for the same asset or liability might be different for different entities (and businesses within those entities).
That assumed transaction establishes a basis for estimating the price to sell the asset or to transfer the liability.
Rather, the entity shall identify characteristics that distinguish market participants generally, considering factors specific to all the following
the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability; and
market participants with whom the entity would enter into a transaction in that market.
Transaction costs shall be accounted for in accordance with other IFRSs.
If location is a characteristic of the asset (as might be the case, for example, for a commodity), the price in the principal (or most advantageous) market shall be adjusted for the costs, if any, that would be incurred to transport the asset from its current location to that market.
Highest and best use for non-financial assets
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
However, an entity's current use of a non-financial asset is presumed to be its highest and best use unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset.
For example, that might be the case for an acquired intangible asset that the entity plans to use defensively by preventing others from using it.
Nevertheless, the entity shall measure the fair value of a non-financial asset assuming its highest and best use by market participants.
Valuation premise for non-financial assets
That is the case even when that fair value measurement assumes that the highest and best use of the asset is to use it in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities because a fair value measurement assumes that the market participant already holds the complementary assets and the associated liabilities.
A fair value measurement assumes that a financial or non-financial liability or an entity's own equity instrument (eg equity interests issued as consideration in a business combination) is transferred to a market participant at the measurement date.
The transfer of a liability or an entity's own equity instrument assumes the following
The instrument would not be cancelled or otherwise extinguished on the measurement date.
Liabilities and equity instruments held by other parties as assets
using the quoted price in an active market for the identical item held by another party as an asset, if that price is available.
if that price is not available, using other observable inputs, such as the quoted price in a market that is not active for the identical item held by another party as an asset.
if the observable prices in (a) and (b) are not available, using another valuation technique, such as
an income approach (eg a present value technique that takes into account the future cash flows that a market participant would expect to receive from holding the liability or equity instrument as an asset; see paragraphs B10 and B11).
a market approach (eg using quoted prices for similar liabilities or equity instruments held by other parties as assets; see paragraphs B5–B7).
An entity shall ensure that the price of the asset does not reflect the effect of a restriction preventing the sale of that asset.
If the unit of account for the liability is not for the combined package, the objective is to measure the fair value of the issuer's liability, not the fair value of the combined package.
Liabilities and equity instruments not held by other parties as assets
the future cash outflows that a market participant would expect to incur in fulfilling the obligation, including the compensation that a market participant would require for taking on the obligation (see paragraphs B31–B33).
the amount that a market participant would receive to enter into or issue an identical liability or equity instrument, using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the identical item (eg having the same credit characteristics) in the principal (or most advantageous) market for issuing a liability or an equity instrument with the same contractual terms.
Non-performance risk is assumed to be the same before and after the transfer of the liability.
That effect may differ depending on the liability, for example
whether the liability is an obligation to deliver cash (a financial liability) or an obligation to deliver goods or services (a non-financial liability).
the terms of credit enhancements related to the liability, if any.
Restriction preventing the transfer of a liability or an entity's own equity instrument
The effect of a restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability or an entity's own equity instrument is either implicitly or explicitly included in the other inputs to the fair value measurement.
As a result of the restriction being included in the transaction price, a separate input or an adjustment to an existing input is not required at the transaction date to reflect the effect of the restriction on transfer.
Similarly, a separate input or an adjustment to an existing input is not required at subsequent measurement dates to reflect the effect of the restriction on transfer.
Financial liability with a demand feature
If the entity manages that group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the entity is permitted to apply an exception to this IFRS for measuring fair value.
That exception permits an entity to measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the price that would be received to sell a net long position (ie an asset) for a particular risk exposure or paid to transfer a net short position (ie a liability) for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.
Accordingly, an entity shall measure the fair value of the group of financial assets and financial liabilities consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
manages the group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the entity's net exposure to a particular market risk (or risks) or to the credit risk of a particular counterparty in accordance with the entity's documented risk management or investment strategy;
In some cases the basis for the presentation of financial instruments in the statement of financial position differs from the basis for the measurement of financial instruments, for example, if an IFRS does not require or permit financial instruments to be presented on a net basis.
For example, an entity would not combine the interest rate risk associated with a financial asset with the commodity price risk associated with a financial liability because doing so would not mitigate the entity's exposure to interest rate risk or commodity price risk.
Exposure to the credit risk of a particular counterparty
The fair value measurement shall reflect market participants' expectations about the likelihood that such an arrangement would be legally enforceable in the event of default.
In contrast, the fair value of the asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability (an exit price).
Entities do not necessarily sell assets at the prices paid to acquire them.
Similarly, entities do not necessarily transfer liabilities at the prices received to assume them.
Paragraph B4 describes situations in which the transaction price might not represent the fair value of an asset or a liability at initial recognition.
The main aspects of those approaches are summarised in paragraphs B5–B11.
In other cases, multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate (eg that might be the case when valuing a cash-generating unit).
If multiple valuation techniques are used to measure fair value, the results (ie respective indications of fair value) shall be evaluated considering the reasonableness of the range of values indicated by those results.
A fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances.
After initial recognition, when measuring fair value using a valuation technique or techniques that use unobservable inputs, an entity shall ensure that those valuation techniques reflect observable market data (eg the price for a similar asset or liability) at the measurement date.
However, a change in a valuation technique or its application (eg a change in its weighting when multiple valuation techniques are used or a change in an adjustment applied to a valuation technique) is appropriate if the change results in a measurement that is equally or more representative of fair value in the circumstances.
That might be the case if, for example, any of the following events take place
information previously used is no longer available;
In some cases those characteristics result in the application of an adjustment, such as a premium or discount (eg a control premium or non-controlling interest discount).
Inputs based on bid and ask prices
The use of bid prices for asset positions and ask prices for liability positions is permitted, but is not required.
In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the entire measurement requires judgement, taking into account factors specific to the asset or liability.
Adjustments to arrive at measurements based on fair value, such as costs to sell when measuring fair value less costs to sell, shall not be taken into account when determining the level of the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement is categorised.
However, the fair value hierarchy prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques, not the valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
For example, if a market participant would take into account the effect of a restriction on the sale of an asset when estimating the price for the asset, an entity would adjust the quoted price to reflect the effect of that restriction.
the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability; and
whether the entity can enter into a transaction for the asset or liability at the price in that market at the measurement date.
In that case, as a practical expedient, an entity may measure fair value using an alternative pricing method that does not rely exclusively on quoted prices (eg matrix pricing).
However, the use of an alternative pricing method results in a fair value measurement categorised within a lower level of the fair value hierarchy.
when a quoted price in an active market does not represent fair value at the measurement date.
That might be the case if, for example, significant events (such as transactions in a principal-to-principal market, trades in a brokered market or announcements) take place after the close of a market but before the measurement date.
An entity shall establish and consistently apply a policy for identifying those events that might affect fair value measurements.
However, if the quoted price is adjusted for new information, the adjustment results in a fair value measurement categorised within a lower level of the fair value hierarchy.
when measuring the fair value of a liability or an entity's own equity instrument using the quoted price for the identical item traded as an asset in an active market and that price needs to be adjusted for factors specific to the item or the asset (see paragraph 39).
However, any adjustment to the quoted price of the asset results in a fair value measurement categorised within a lower level of the fair value hierarchy.
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.
quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, for example
interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals;
the condition or location of the asset;
the extent to which inputs relate to items that are comparable to the asset or liability (including those factors described in paragraph 39); and
the volume or level of activity in the markets within which the inputs are observed.
However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, ie an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability.
Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
A measurement that does not include an adjustment for risk would not represent a fair value measurement if market participants would include one when pricing the asset or liability.
For example, it might be necessary to include a risk adjustment when there is significant measurement uncertainty (eg when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity when compared with normal market activity for the asset or liability, or similar assets or liabilities, and the entity has determined that the transaction price or quoted price does not represent fair value, as described in paragraphs B37–B47).
An entity need not undertake exhaustive efforts to obtain information about market participant assumptions.
However, an entity shall take into account all information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available.
Unobservable inputs developed in the manner described above are considered market participant assumptions and meet the objective of a fair value measurement.
for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis in the statement of financial position after initial recognition, the valuation techniques and inputs used to develop those measurements.
If the disclosures provided in accordance with this IFRS and other IFRSs are insufficient to meet the objectives in paragraph 91, an entity shall disclose additional information necessary to meet those objectives.
for recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, the fair value measurement at the end of the reporting period, and for non-recurring fair value measurements, the reasons for the measurement.
Recurring fair value measurements of assets or liabilities are those that other IFRSs require or permit in the statement of financial position at the end of each reporting period.
Transfers into each level shall be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of each level.
However, when providing this disclosure an entity cannot ignore quantitative unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and are reasonably available to the entity.
for all such measurements, a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs if a change in those inputs to a different amount might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
If there are interrelationships between those inputs and other unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement, an entity shall also provide a description of those interrelationships and of how they might magnify or mitigate the effect of changes in the unobservable inputs on the fair value measurement.
To comply with that disclosure requirement, the narrative description of the sensitivity to changes in unobservable inputs shall include, at a minimum, the unobservable inputs disclosed when complying with (d).
The entity shall disclose how the effect of a change to reflect a reasonably possible alternative assumption was calculated.
For that purpose, significance shall be judged with respect to profit or loss, and total assets or total liabilities, or, when changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income, total equity.
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability; and
the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised.
Determining appropriate classes of assets and liabilities for which disclosures about fair value measurements should be provided requires judgement.
A class of assets and liabilities will often require greater disaggregation than the line items presented in the statement of financial position.
However, an entity shall provide information sufficient to permit reconciliation to the line items presented in the statement of financial position.
If another IFRS specifies the class for an asset or a liability, an entity may use that class in providing the disclosures required in this IFRS if that class meets the requirements in this paragraph.
The policy about the timing of recognising transfers shall be the same for transfers into the levels as for transfers out of the levels.
Examples of policies for determining the timing of transfers include the following
the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
For such assets and liabilities, an entity does not need to provide the other disclosures required by this IFRS.
A valuation technique that reflects the amount that would be required currently to replace the service capacity of an asset (often referred to as current replacement cost).
The price paid to acquire an asset or received to assume a liability in an exchange transaction.
The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability.
The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Valuation techniques that convert future amounts (eg cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current (ie discounted) amount.
The fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.
The assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, such as the following
(a)  the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value (such as a pricing model); and
(b)  the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
Inputs may be observable or unobservable.
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Buyers and sellers in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability that have all of the following characteristics
The market that maximises the amount that would be received to sell the asset or minimises the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability, after taking into account transaction costs and transport costs.
The risk that an entity will not fulfil an obligation.
Non-performance risk includes, but may not be limited to, the entity's own credit risk.
Inputs that are developed using market data, such as publicly available information about actual events or transactions, and that reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
The market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability.
Compensation sought by risk-averse market participants for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows of an asset or a liability.
Also referred to as a 'risk adjustment'.
The costs to sell an asset or transfer a liability in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability that are directly attributable to the disposal of the asset or the transfer of the liability and meet both of the following criteria
The costs that would be incurred to transport an asset from its current location to its principal (or most advantageous) market.
Inputs for which market data are not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
The judgements applied in different valuation situations may be different.
This appendix describes the judgements that might apply when an entity measures fair value in different valuation situations.
The fair value measurement approach
The objective of a fair value measurement is to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.
A fair value measurement requires an entity to determine all the following
the particular asset or liability that is the subject of the measurement (consistently with its unit of account).
for a non-financial asset, the valuation premise that is appropriate for the measurement (consistently with its highest and best use).
the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability.
When measuring the fair value of a non-financial asset used in combination with other assets as a group (as installed or otherwise configured for use) or in combination with other assets and liabilities (eg a business), the effect of the valuation premise depends on the circumstances.
the fair value of the asset might be the same whether the asset is used on a stand-alone basis or in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities.
That might be the case if the asset is a business that market participants would continue to operate.
In that case, the transaction would involve valuing the business in its entirety.
The use of the assets as a group in an ongoing business would generate synergies that would be available to market participants (ie market participant synergies that, therefore, should affect the fair value of the asset on either a stand-alone basis or in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities).
an asset's use in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities might be incorporated into the fair value measurement through adjustments to the value of the asset used on a stand-alone basis.
That might be the case if the asset is a machine and the fair value measurement is determined using an observed price for a similar machine (not installed or otherwise configured for use), adjusted for transport and installation costs so that the fair value measurement reflects the current condition and location of the machine (installed and configured for use).
an asset's use in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities might be incorporated into the fair value measurement through the market participant assumptions used to measure the fair value of the asset.
For example, if the asset is work in progress inventory that is unique and market participants would convert the inventory into finished goods, the fair value of the inventory would assume that market participants have acquired or would acquire any specialised machinery necessary to convert the inventory into finished goods.
an asset's use in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities might be incorporated into the valuation technique used to measure the fair value of the asset.
That might be the case when using the multi-period excess earnings method to measure the fair value of an intangible asset because that valuation technique specifically takes into account the contribution of any complementary assets and the associated liabilities in the group in which such an intangible asset would be used.
in more limited situations, when an entity uses an asset within a group of assets, the entity might measure the asset at an amount that approximates its fair value when allocating the fair value of the asset group to the individual assets of the group.
That might be the case if the valuation involves real property and the fair value of improved property (ie an asset group) is allocated to its component assets (such as land and improvements).
When determining whether fair value at initial recognition equals the transaction price, an entity shall take into account factors specific to the transaction and to the asset or liability.
For example, the transaction price might not represent the fair value of an asset or a liability at initial recognition if any of the following conditions exist
For example, that might be the case if the seller is experiencing financial difficulty.
For example, those markets might be different if the entity is a dealer that enters into transactions with customers in the retail market, but the principal (or most advantageous) market for the exit transaction is with other dealers in the dealer market.
For example, valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables.
Multiples might be in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable.
The selection of the appropriate multiple within the range requires judgement, considering qualitative and quantitative factors specific to the measurement.
Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach include matrix pricing.
Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value some types of financial instruments, such as debt securities, without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities.
The cost approach reflects the amount that would be required currently to replace the service capacity of an asset (often referred to as current replacement cost).
From the perspective of a market participant seller, the price that would be received for the asset is based on the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.
That is because a market participant buyer would not pay more for an asset than the amount for which it could replace the service capacity of that asset.
In many cases the current replacement cost method is used to measure the fair value of tangible assets that are used in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities.
The income approach converts future amounts (eg cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current (ie discounted) amount.
When the income approach is used, the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about those future amounts.
Those valuation techniques include, for example, the following
present value techniques (see paragraphs B12–B30);
option pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes-Merton formula or a binomial model (ie a lattice model), that incorporate present value techniques and reflect both the time value and the intrinsic value of an option; and
the multi-period excess earnings method, which is used to measure the fair value of some intangible assets.
Paragraphs B13–B30 describe the use of present value techniques to measure fair value.
Those paragraphs focus on a discount rate adjustment technique and an expected cash flow (expected present value) technique.
Those paragraphs neither prescribe the use of a single specific present value technique nor limit the use of present value techniques to measure fair value to the techniques discussed.
The present value technique used to measure fair value will depend on facts and circumstances specific to the asset or liability being measured (eg whether prices for comparable assets or liabilities can be observed in the market) and the availability of sufficient data.
Present value (ie an application of the income approach) is a tool used to link future amounts (eg cash flows or values) to a present amount using a discount rate.
A fair value measurement of an asset or a liability using a present value technique captures all the following elements from the perspective of market participants at the measurement date
an estimate of future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured.
expectations about possible variations in the amount and timing of the cash flows representing the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows.
the time value of money, represented by the rate on risk-free monetary assets that have maturity dates or durations that coincide with the period covered by the cash flows and pose neither uncertainty in timing nor risk of default to the holder (ie a risk-free interest rate).
the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows (ie a risk premium).
other factors that market participants would take into account in the circumstances.
for a liability, the non-performance risk relating to that liability, including the entity's (ie the obligor's) own credit risk.
Present value techniques differ in how they capture the elements in paragraph B13.
For example, a discount rate that reflects the uncertainty in expectations about future defaults is appropriate if using contractual cash flows of a loan (ie a discount rate adjustment technique).
For example, nominal cash flows, which include the effect of inflation, should be discounted at a rate that includes the effect of inflation.
The nominal risk-free interest rate includes the effect of inflation.
Real cash flows, which exclude the effect of inflation, should be discounted at a rate that excludes the effect of inflation.
Similarly, after-tax cash flows should be discounted using an after-tax discount rate.
Pre-tax cash flows should be discounted at a rate consistent with those cash flows.
A fair value measurement using present value techniques is made under conditions of uncertainty because the cash flows used are estimates rather than known amounts.
In many cases both the amount and timing of the cash flows are uncertain.
Even contractually fixed amounts, such as the payments on a loan, are uncertain if there is risk of default.
Market participants generally seek compensation (ie a risk premium) for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows of an asset or a liability.
A fair value measurement should include a risk premium reflecting the amount that market participants would demand as compensation for the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows.
Otherwise, the measurement would not faithfully represent fair value.
In some cases determining the appropriate risk premium might be difficult.
However, the degree of difficulty alone is not a sufficient reason to exclude a risk premium.
Present value techniques differ in how they adjust for risk and in the type of cash flows they use.
That rate is different from the rate used in the discount rate adjustment technique.
The discount rate adjustment technique uses a single set of cash flows from the range of possible estimated amounts, whether contractual or promised (as is the case for a bond) or most likely cash flows.
In all cases, those cash flows are conditional upon the occurrence of specified events (eg contractual or promised cash flows for a bond are conditional on the event of no default by the debtor).
The discount rate used in the discount rate adjustment technique is derived from observed rates of return for comparable assets or liabilities that are traded in the market.
Accordingly, the contractual, promised or most likely cash flows are discounted at an observed or estimated market rate for such conditional cash flows (ie a market rate of return).
The discount rate adjustment technique requires an analysis of market data for comparable assets or liabilities.
Comparability is established by considering the nature of the cash flows (eg whether the cash flows are contractual or non-contractual and are likely to respond similarly to changes in economic conditions), as well as other factors (eg credit standing, collateral, duration, restrictive covenants and liquidity).
There is an established market for comparable assets, and information about those assets, including price information, is available.
When the discount rate adjustment technique is applied to fixed receipts or payments, the adjustment for risk inherent in the cash flows of the asset or liability being measured is included in the discount rate.
In some applications of the discount rate adjustment technique to cash flows that are not fixed receipts or payments, an adjustment to the cash flows may be necessary to achieve comparability with the observed asset or liability from which the discount rate is derived.
The resulting estimate is identical to expected value, which, in statistical terms, is the weighted average of a discrete random variable's possible values with the respective probabilities as the weights.
Because all possible cash flows are probability-weighted, the resulting expected cash flow is not conditional upon the occurrence of any specified event (unlike the cash flows used in the discount rate adjustment technique).
In making an investment decision, risk-averse market participants would take into account the risk that the actual cash flows may differ from the expected cash flows.
unsystematic (diversifiable) risk, which is the risk specific to a particular asset or liability.
systematic (non-diversifiable) risk, which is the common risk shared by an asset or a liability with the other items in a diversified portfolio.
Portfolio theory holds that in a market in equilibrium, market participants will be compensated only for bearing the systematic risk inherent in the cash flows.
Those risk-adjusted expected cash flows represent a certainty-equivalent cash flow, which is discounted at a risk-free interest rate.
A certainty-equivalent cash flow refers to an expected cash flow (as defined), adjusted for risk so that a market participant is indifferent to trading a certain cash flow for an expected cash flow.
In that case the market participant would be indifferent as to the asset held.
Accordingly, the expected cash flows are discounted at a rate that corresponds to an expected rate associated with probability-weighted cash flows (ie an expected rate of return).
In more realistic situations, there could be many possible outcomes.
However, to apply the expected present value technique, it is not always necessary to take into account distributions of all possible cash flows using complex models and techniques.
Rather, it might be possible to develop a limited number of discrete scenarios and probabilities that capture the array of possible cash flows.
For example, an entity might use realised cash flows for some relevant past period, adjusted for changes in circumstances occurring subsequently (eg changes in external factors, including economic or market conditions, industry trends and competition as well as changes in internal factors affecting the entity more specifically), taking into account the assumptions of market participants.
In the absence of market data directly indicating the amount of the risk adjustment, such adjustment could be derived from an asset pricing model using the concept of certainty equivalents.
Rather, the adjustment for that risk is included in the discount rate.
When using a present value technique to measure the fair value of a liability that is not held by another party as an asset (eg a decommissioning liability), an entity shall, among other things, estimate the future cash outflows that market participants would expect to incur in fulfilling the obligation.
Those future cash outflows shall include market participants' expectations about the costs of fulfilling the obligation and the compensation that a market participant would require for taking on the obligation.
Such compensation includes the return that a market participant would require for the following
For example, a non-financial liability does not contain a contractual rate of return and there is no observable market yield for that liability.
by adjusting the cash flows (ie as an increase in the amount of cash outflows); or
by adjusting the rate used to discount the future cash flows to their present values (ie as a reduction in the discount rate).
An entity shall ensure that it does not double-count or omit adjustments for risk.
For example, if the estimated cash flows are increased to take into account the compensation for assuming the risk associated with the obligation, the discount rate should not be adjusted to reflect that risk.
In an exchange market, closing prices are both readily available and generally representative of fair value.
In a dealer market, dealers stand ready to trade (either buy or sell for their own account), thereby providing liquidity by using their capital to hold an inventory of the items for which they make a market.
Typically bid and ask prices (representing the price at which the dealer is willing to buy and the price at which the dealer is willing to sell, respectively) are more readily available than closing prices.
Over-the-counter markets (for which prices are publicly reported) are dealer markets.
In a brokered market, brokers attempt to match buyers with sellers but do not stand ready to trade for their own account.
In other words, brokers do not use their own capital to hold an inventory of the items for which they make a market.
The broker knows the prices bid and asked by the respective parties, but each party is typically unaware of another party's price requirements.
Prices of completed transactions are sometimes available.
Brokered markets include electronic communication networks, in which buy and sell orders are matched, and commercial and residential real estate markets.
In a principal-to-principal market, transactions, both originations and resales, are negotiated independently with no intermediary.
Little information about those transactions may be made available publicly.
Conceptually, the fair value measurement will be the same, whether adjustments are made to a retail price (downward) or to a wholesale price (upward).
Generally, the price that requires the least amount of subjective adjustments should be used for the fair value measurement.
The interest rates in a currency swap are the swap rates calculated from the respective countries' yield curves.
Historical volatility typically does not represent current market participants' expectations about future volatility, even if it is the only information available to price an option.
Measuring fair value when the volume or level of activity for an asset or a liability has significantly decreased
The fair value of an asset or a liability might be affected when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for that asset or liability in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities).
If an entity concludes that there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities), further analysis of the transactions or quoted prices is needed.
A decrease in the volume or level of activity on its own may not indicate that a transaction price or quoted price does not represent fair value or that a transaction in that market is not orderly.
However, if an entity determines that a transaction or quoted price does not represent fair value (eg there may be transactions that are not orderly), an adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices will be necessary if the entity uses those prices as a basis for measuring fair value and that adjustment may be significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Adjustments also may be necessary in other circumstances (eg when a price for a similar asset requires significant adjustment to make it comparable to the asset being measured or when the price is stale).
This IFRS does not prescribe a methodology for making significant adjustments to transactions or quoted prices.
Regardless of the valuation technique used, an entity shall include appropriate risk adjustments, including a risk premium reflecting the amount that market participants would demand as compensation for the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows of an asset or a liability (see paragraph B17).
Otherwise, the measurement does not faithfully represent fair value.
In some cases determining the appropriate risk adjustment might be difficult.
However, the degree of difficulty alone is not a sufficient basis on which to exclude a risk adjustment.
The risk adjustment shall be reflective of an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.
If there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate (eg the use of a market approach and a present value technique).
When weighting indications of fair value resulting from the use of multiple valuation techniques, an entity shall consider the reasonableness of the range of fair value measurements.
The objective is to determine the point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions.
A wide range of fair value measurements may be an indication that further analysis is needed.
Even when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability, the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (ie not a forced liquidation or distress sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.
Estimating the price at which market participants would be willing to enter into a transaction at the measurement date under current market conditions if there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability depends on the facts and circumstances at the measurement date and requires judgement.
An entity's intention to hold the asset or to settle or otherwise fulfil the liability is not relevant when measuring fair value because fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.
Identifying transactions that are not orderly
The determination of whether a transaction is orderly (or is not orderly) is more difficult if there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities).
In such circumstances it is not appropriate to conclude that all transactions in that market are not orderly (ie forced liquidations or distress sales).
Circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly include the following
An entity shall evaluate the circumstances to determine whether, on the weight of the evidence available, the transaction is orderly.
An entity shall consider all the following when measuring fair value or estimating market risk premiums
The amount of weight placed on that transaction price when compared with other indications of fair value will depend on the facts and circumstances, such as the following
the volume of the transaction.
the comparability of the transaction to the asset or liability being measured.
However, that transaction price may not represent fair value (ie the transaction price is not necessarily the sole or primary basis for measuring fair value or estimating market risk premiums).
When an entity does not have sufficient information to conclude whether particular transactions are orderly, the entity shall place less weight on those transactions when compared with other transactions that are known to be orderly.
An entity need not undertake exhaustive efforts to determine whether a transaction is orderly, but it shall not ignore information that is reasonably available.
When an entity is a party to a transaction, it is presumed to have sufficient information to conclude whether the transaction is orderly.
In weighting a quoted price as an input to a fair value measurement, an entity places less weight (when compared with other indications of fair value that reflect the results of transactions) on quotes that do not reflect the result of transactions.

geography (eg country or region).
An interest in another entity refers to contractual and non-contractual involvement that exposes the reporting entity to variability of returns from the performance of the other entity.
Consideration of the purpose and design of the other entity may help the reporting entity when assessing whether it has an interest in that entity and, therefore, whether it is required to provide the disclosures in this IFRS.
That assessment shall include consideration of the risks that the other entity was designed to create and the risks the other entity was designed to pass on to the reporting entity and other parties.
A reporting entity is typically exposed to variability of returns from the performance of another entity by holding instruments (such as equity or debt instruments issued by the other entity) or having another involvement that absorbs variability.
For example, assume a structured entity holds a loan portfolio.
The structured entity obtains a credit default swap from another entity (the reporting entity) to protect itself from the default of interest and principal payments on the loans.
The reporting entity has involvement that exposes it to variability of returns from the performance of the structured entity because the credit default swap absorbs variability of returns of the structured entity.
Some instruments are designed to transfer risk from a reporting entity to another entity.
Such instruments create variability of returns for the other entity but do not typically expose the reporting entity to variability of returns from the performance of the other entity.
For example, assume a structured entity is established to provide investment opportunities for investors who wish to have exposure to entity Z's credit risk (entity Z is unrelated to any party involved in the arrangement).
The structured entity obtains funding by issuing to those investors notes that are linked to entity Z's credit risk (credit-linked notes) and uses the proceeds to invest in a portfolio of risk-free financial assets.
The investors in the structured entity receive a higher return that reflects both the structured entity's return from its asset portfolio and the CDS fee.
The swap counterparty does not have involvement with the structured entity that exposes it to variability of returns from the performance of the structured entity because the CDS transfers variability to the structured entity, rather than absorbing variability of returns of the structured entity.
For each subsidiary that has non-controlling interests that are material to the reporting entity, an entity shall disclose
dividends paid to non-controlling interests.
summarised financial information about the assets, liabilities, profit or loss and cash flows of the subsidiary that enables users to understand the interest that non-controlling interests have in the group's activities and cash flows.
That information might include but is not limited to, for example, current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities, revenue, profit or loss and total comprehensive income.
The summarised financial information required by paragraph B10(b) shall be the amounts before inter-company eliminations.
For each joint venture and associate that is material to the reporting entity, an entity shall disclose
dividends received from the joint venture or associate.
summarised financial information for the joint venture or associate (see paragraphs B14 and B15) including, but not necessarily limited to
(vi) profit or loss from continuing operations.
In addition to the summarised financial information required by paragraph B12, an entity shall disclose for each joint venture that is material to the reporting entity the amount of
cash and cash equivalents included in paragraph B12(b)(i).
non-current financial liabilities (excluding trade and other payables and provisions) included in paragraph B12(b)(iv).
income tax expense or income.
If the entity accounts for its interest in the joint venture or associate using the equity method
the amounts included in the IFRS financial statements of the joint venture or associate shall be adjusted to reflect adjustments made by the entity when using the equity method, such as fair value adjustments made at the time of acquisition and adjustments for differences in accounting policies.
the entity shall provide a reconciliation of the summarised financial information presented to the carrying amount of its interest in the joint venture or associate.
the joint venture or associate does not prepare IFRS financial statements and preparation on that basis would be impracticable or cause undue cost.
In that case, the entity shall disclose the basis on which the summarised financial information has been prepared.
An entity shall disclose, in aggregate, the carrying amount of its interests in all individually immaterial joint ventures or associates that are accounted for using the equity method.
An entity shall also disclose separately the aggregate amount of its share of those joint ventures' or associates
profit or loss from continuing operations.
post-tax profit or loss from discontinued operations.
An entity provides the disclosures separately for joint ventures and associates.
When an entity's interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate (or a portion of its interest in a joint venture or an associate) is classified (or included in a disposal group that is classified) as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, the entity is not required to disclose summarised financial information for that subsidiary, joint venture or associate in accordance with paragraphs B10–B16.
Commitments for joint ventures (paragraph 23(a))
An entity shall disclose total commitments it has made but not recognised at the reporting date (including its share of commitments made jointly with other investors with joint control of a joint venture) relating to its interests in joint ventures.
Commitments are those that may give rise to a future outflow of cash or other resources.
Unrecognised commitments that may give rise to a future outflow of cash or other resources include
unrecognised commitments to contribute funding or resources as a result of, for example
the constitution or acquisition agreements of a joint venture (that, for example, require an entity to contribute funds over a specific period).
capital-intensive projects undertaken by a joint venture.
(iii) unconditional purchase obligations, comprising procurement of equipment, inventory or services that an entity is committed to purchasing from, or on behalf of, a joint venture.
(iv) unrecognised commitments to provide loans or other financial support to a joint venture.
unrecognised commitments to contribute resources to a joint venture, such as assets or services.
(vi) other non-cancellable unrecognised commitments relating to a joint venture.
unrecognised commitments to acquire another party's ownership interest (or a portion of that ownership interest) in a joint venture if a particular event occurs or does not occur in the future.
A structured entity often has some or all of the following features or attributes
insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support.
financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other risks (tranches).
Examples of entities that are regarded as structured entities include, but are not limited to
Examples of additional information that, depending on the circumstances, might be relevant to an assessment of the risks to which an entity is exposed when it has an interest in an unconsolidated structured entity are
the terms of an arrangement that could require the entity to provide financial support to an unconsolidated structured entity (eg liquidity arrangements or credit rating triggers associated with obligations to purchase assets of the structured entity or provide financial support), including
a description of events or circumstances that could expose the reporting entity to a loss.
whether there are any terms that would limit the obligation.
losses incurred by the entity during the reporting period relating to its interests in unconsolidated structured entities.
the types of income the entity received during the reporting period from its interests in unconsolidated structured entities.
whether the entity is required to absorb losses of an unconsolidated structured entity before other parties, the maximum limit of such losses for the entity, and (if relevant) the ranking and amounts of potential losses borne by parties whose interests rank lower than the entity's interest in the unconsolidated structured entity.
any difficulties an unconsolidated structured entity has experienced in financing its activities during the reporting period.
in relation to the funding of an unconsolidated structured entity, the forms of funding (eg commercial paper or medium-term notes) and their weighted-average life.
That information might include maturity analyses of the assets and funding of an unconsolidated structured entity if the structured entity has longer-term assets funded by shorter-term funding.
it expects to settle the liability in its normal operating cycle;
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading;
An entity shall classify all other liabilities as non-current.
Normal operating cycle (paragraph 69(a))
The same normal operating cycle applies to the classification of an entity's assets and liabilities.
Examples are some financial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading in IFRS 9, bank overdrafts, and the current portion of non-current financial liabilities, dividends payable, income taxes and other non-trade payables.
an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the reporting period and before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
If the right to defer settlement is subject to the entity complying with specified conditions, the right exists at the end of the reporting period only if the entity complies with those conditions at the end of the reporting period.
If the entity has no such right, the entity does not consider the potential to refinance the obligation and classifies the obligation as current.
However, in either of those circumstances, the entity may need to disclose information about the timing of settlement to enable users of its financial statements to understand the impact of the liability on the entity's financial position (see paragraphs 17(c) and 76(d)).
rectification of a breach of a long-term loan arrangement classified as current (see paragraph 74);
Settlement (paragraphs 69(a), 69(c) and 69(d))
For the purpose of classifying a liability as current or non-current, settlement refers to a transfer to the counterparty that results in the extinguishment of the liability.
cash or other economic resources--for example, goods or services; or
the entity's own equity instruments, unless paragraph 76B applies.
lease liabilities recognised by a lessee are subject to the derecognition requirements in paragraph 3.3.1 of this Standard; and
However, the holder of such equity instruments shall apply this Standard to those instruments, unless they meet the exception in (a).
The term of the forward contract should not exceed a reasonable period normally necessary to obtain any required approvals and to complete the transaction.
loan commitments other than those loan commitments described in paragraph 2.3.
However, an issuer of loan commitments shall apply the impairment requirements of this Standard to loan commitments that are not otherwise within the scope of this Standard.
Also, all loan commitments are subject to the derecognition requirements of this Standard.
loan commitments that the entity designates as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (see paragraph 4.2.2).
An entity that has a past practice of selling the assets resulting from its loan commitments shortly after origination shall apply this Standard to all its loan commitments in the same class.
loan commitments that can be settled net in cash or by delivering or issuing another financial instrument.
These loan commitments are derivatives.
A loan commitment is not regarded as settled net merely because the loan is paid out in instalments (for example, a mortgage construction loan that is paid out in instalments in line with the progress of construction).
commitments to provide a loan at a below-market interest rate (see paragraph 4.2.1(d)).
when the ability to settle net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, is not explicit in the terms of the contract, but the entity has a practice of settling similar contracts net in cash or another financial instrument or by exchanging financial instruments (whether with the counterparty, by entering into offsetting contracts or by selling the contract before its exercise or lapse);
when the non-financial item that is the subject of the contract is readily convertible to cash.
A contract to which (b) or (c) applies is not entered into for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the non-financial item in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements and, accordingly, is within the scope of this Standard.
Regular way purchase or sale of financial assets
A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets shall be recognised and derecognised, as applicable, using trade date accounting or settlement date accounting (see paragraphs B3.1.3–B3.1.6).
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or
transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, or
Short-term advances by the entity with the right of full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued interest at market rates do not violate this condition.
if the entity transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the entity shall derecognise the financial asset and recognise separately as assets or liabilities any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
if the entity retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the entity shall continue to recognise the financial asset.
if the entity neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the entity shall determine whether it has retained control of the financial asset.
if the entity has not retained control, it shall derecognise the financial asset and recognise separately as assets or liabilities any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
if the entity has retained control, it shall continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset (see paragraph 3.2.16).
An entity has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset if its exposure to the variability in the present value of the future net cash flows from the financial asset does not change significantly as a result of the transfer (eg because the entity has sold a financial asset subject to an agreement to buy it back at a fixed price or the sale price plus a lender's return).
In other cases, it will be necessary to compute and compare the entity's exposure to the variability in the present value of the future net cash flows before and after the transfer.
The computation and comparison are made using as the discount rate an appropriate current market interest rate.
All reasonably possible variability in net cash flows is considered, with greater weight being given to those outcomes that are more likely to occur.
In all other cases, the entity has retained control.
Transfers that qualify for derecognition
If the fee to be received is not expected to compensate the entity adequately for performing the servicing, a servicing liability for the servicing obligation shall be recognised at its fair value.
the carrying amount (measured at the date of derecognition) and
the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed)
For this purpose, a retained servicing asset shall be treated as a part that continues to be recognised.
the carrying amount (measured at the date of derecognition) allocated to the part derecognised and
the consideration received for the part derecognised (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) shall be recognised in profit or loss.
When the entity has a history of selling parts similar to the part that continues to be recognised or other market transactions exist for such parts, recent prices of actual transactions provide the best estimate of its fair value.
When there are no price quotes or recent market transactions to support the fair value of the part that continues to be recognised, the best estimate of the fair value is the difference between the fair value of the larger financial asset as a whole and the consideration received from the transferee for the part that is derecognised.
In subsequent periods, the entity shall recognise any income on the transferred asset and any expense incurred on the financial liability.
Continuing involvement in transferred assets
The extent of the entity's continuing involvement in the transferred asset is the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.
Despite the other measurement requirements in this Standard, the transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the entity has retained.
The associated liability is measured in such a way that the net carrying amount of the transferred asset and the associated liability is
the amortised cost of the rights and obligations retained by the entity, if the transferred asset is measured at amortised cost, or
the carrying amount (measured at the date of derecognition) allocated to the part that is no longer recognised and
the consideration received for the part no longer recognised shall be recognised in profit or loss.
Similarly, a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability or a part of it (whether or not attributable to the financial difficulty of the debtor) shall be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
The difference between (a) the carrying amount allocated to the part derecognised and (b) the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, for the part derecognised shall be recognised in profit or loss.
the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and
the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Paragraphs B4.1.1–B4.1.26 provide guidance on how to apply these conditions.
A financial asset shall be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met
the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and
principal is the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition.
Paragraph B4.1.7B provides additional guidance on the meaning of principal.
interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin.
Option to designate a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss
Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair value.
An issuer of such a commitment shall (unless paragraph 4.2.1(a) applies) subsequently measure it at the higher of
Such contingent consideration shall subsequently be measured at fair value with changes recognised in profit or loss.
Option to designate a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss
it eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as 'an accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases (see paragraphs B4.1.29–B4.1.32); or
An embedded derivative causes some or all of the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract to be modified according to a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract.
A derivative that is attached to a financial instrument but is contractually transferable independently of that instrument, or has a different counterparty, is not an embedded derivative, but a separate financial instrument.
Hybrid contracts with financial asset hosts
the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host (see paragraphs B4.3.5 and B4.3.8);
a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and
the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss (ie a derivative that is embedded in a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss is not separated).
This Standard does not address whether an embedded derivative shall be presented separately in the statement of financial position.
See paragraphs 5.6.1–5.6.7, B4.4.1–B4.4.3 and B5.6.1–B5.6.2 for additional guidance on reclassifying financial assets.
an item that was previously a designated and effective hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge no longer qualifies as such;
an item becomes a designated and effective hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge; and
changes in measurement in accordance with Section 6.7.
However, if the fair value of the financial asset or financial liability at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, an entity shall apply paragraph B5.1.2A.
Modification of contractual cash flows
The gross carrying amount of the financial asset shall be recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets) or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.5.10.
Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.
A write-off constitutes a derecognition event (see paragraph B3.2.16(r)).
by amending the contractual terms specified at the initial recognition of the financial instrument (for example, the contractual terms are amended to replace the referenced interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate);
in a way that was not considered by—or contemplated in—the contractual terms at the initial recognition of the financial instrument, without amending the contractual terms (for example, the method for calculating the interest rate benchmark is altered without amending the contractual terms); and/or
because of the activation of an existing contractual term (for example, an existing fallback clause is triggered).
For this purpose, a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if, and only if, both these conditions are met
the change is necessary as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform; and
the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis (ie the basis immediately preceding the change).
the addition of a fallback provision to the contractual terms of a financial asset or financial liability to enable any change described in (a) and (b) above to be implemented.
The entity shall then apply the applicable requirements in this Standard to any additional changes to which the practical expedient does not apply.
If the additional change results in the derecognition of the financial asset or financial liability, the entity shall apply the derecognition requirements.
However, the loss allowance shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and shall not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset in the statement of financial position.
When making the assessment, an entity shall use the change in the risk of a default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument instead of the change in the amount of expected credit losses.
To make that assessment, an entity shall compare the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition and consider reasonable and supportable information, that is available without undue cost or effort, that is indicative of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition.
However, when information that is more forward-looking than past due status (either on an individual or a collective basis) is not available without undue cost or effort, an entity may use past due information to determine whether there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition.
the risk of a default occurring at the reporting date (based on the modified contractual terms); and
the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified contractual terms).
An entity shall recognise favourable changes in lifetime expected credit losses as an impairment gain, even if the lifetime expected credit losses are less than the amount of expected credit losses that were included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.
an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
However, it shall consider the risk or probability that a credit loss occurs by reflecting the possibility that a credit loss occurs and the possibility that no credit loss occurs, even if the possibility of a credit loss occurring is very low.
For such financial instruments, and only those financial instruments, the entity shall measure expected credit losses over the period that the entity is exposed to credit risk and expected credit losses would not be mitigated by credit risk management actions, even if that period extends beyond the maximum contractual period.
The entity shall not restate any previously recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.
Any gain or loss arising from a difference between the previous amortised cost of the financial asset and fair value is recognised in profit or loss.
Any gain or loss arising from a difference between the previous amortised cost of the financial asset and fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income.
However, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is removed from equity and adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset at the reclassification date.
As a result, the financial asset is measured at the reclassification date as if it had always been measured at amortised cost.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1) at the reclassification date.
it is a financial liability designated as at fair value through profit or loss and the entity is required to present the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.7; or
it is a financial asset measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A and the entity is required to recognise some changes in fair value in other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.10.
the entity's right to receive payment of the dividend is established;
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity; and
The trade date shall be considered the date of initial recognition for the purposes of applying the impairment requirements.
Paragraphs B5.7.5–B5.7.7 and B5.7.10–B5.7.12 provide guidance on determining whether an accounting mismatch would be created or enlarged.
When the financial asset is derecognised the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1).
Interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
In that case, the entity must also apply the specific requirements for the fair value hedge accounting for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk and designate as the hedged item a portion that is a currency amount (see paragraphs 81A, 89A and AG114–AG132 of IAS 39).
separating the intrinsic value and time value of an option contract and designating as the hedging instrument only the change in intrinsic value of an option and not the change in its time value (see paragraphs 6.5.15 and B6.5.29–B6.5.33);
However, a hedging instrument may not be designated for a part of its change in fair value that results from only a portion of the time period during which the hedging instrument remains outstanding.
derivatives or a proportion of them; and
non-derivatives or a proportion of them.
This includes a forecast transaction of an aggregated exposure (ie uncommitted but anticipated future transactions that would give rise to an exposure and a derivative) if that aggregated exposure is highly probable and, once it has occurred and is therefore no longer forecast, is eligible as a hedged item.
An entire item comprises all changes in the cash flows or fair value of an item.
A component comprises less than the entire fair value change or cash flow variability of an item.
only changes in the cash flows or fair value of an item attributable to a specific risk or risks (risk component), provided that, based on an assessment within the context of the particular market structure, the risk component is separately identifiable and reliably measurable (see paragraphs B6.3.8–B6.3.15).
components of a nominal amount, ie a specified part of the amount of an item (see paragraphs B6.3.16–B6.3.20).
the hedging relationship consists only of eligible hedging instruments and eligible hedged items.
at the inception of the hedging relationship there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entity's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
That documentation shall include identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including its analysis of the sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how it determines the hedge ratio).
the hedging relationship meets all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements
there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument (see paragraphs B6.4.4–B6.4.6);
the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship (see paragraphs B6.4.7–B6.4.8); and
However, that designation shall not reflect an imbalance between the weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that would create hedge ineffectiveness (irrespective of whether recognised or not) that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting (see paragraphs B6.4.9–B6.4.11).
fair value hedge: a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or a component of any such item, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss.
cash flow hedge: a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with all, or a component of, a recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable-rate debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction, and could affect profit or loss.
In that case, and only in that case, the recognised hedge ineffectiveness is presented in other comprehensive income.
This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
For this purpose, the replacement or rollover of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an expiration or termination if such a replacement or rollover is part of, and consistent with, the entity's documented risk management objective.
For this purpose, a clearing counterparty is a central counterparty (sometimes called a 'clearing organisation' or 'clearing agency') or an entity or entities, for example, a clearing member of a clearing organisation or a client of a clearing member of a clearing organisation, that are acting as a counterparty in order to effect clearing by a central counterparty.
However, when the parties to the hedging instrument replace their original counterparties with different counterparties the requirement in this subparagraph is met only if each of those parties effects clearing with the same central counterparty.
Discontinuing hedge accounting can either affect a hedging relationship in its entirety or only a part of it (in which case hedge accounting continues for the remainder of the hedging relationship).
paragraph 6.5.10 when it discontinues hedge accounting for a fair value hedge for which the hedged item is (or is a component of) a financial instrument measured at amortised cost; and
paragraph 6.5.12 when it discontinues hedge accounting for cash flow hedges.
the hedging gain or loss on the hedged item shall adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item (if applicable) and be recognised in profit or loss.
If the hedged item is a financial asset (or a component thereof) that is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A, the hedging gain or loss on the hedged item shall be recognised in profit or loss.
When a hedged item is an unrecognised firm commitment (or a component thereof), the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item subsequent to its designation is recognised as an asset or a liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for hedging gains and losses.
The amortisation is based on a recalculated effective interest rate at the date that amortisation begins.
In the case of a financial asset (or a component thereof) that is a hedged item and that is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A, amortisation applies in the same manner but to the amount that represents the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in accordance with paragraph 6.5.8(b) instead of by adjusting the carrying amount.
the separate component of equity associated with the hedged item (cash flow hedge reserve) is adjusted to the lower of the following (in absolute amounts)
the cumulative change in fair value (present value) of the hedged item (ie the present value of the cumulative change in the hedged expected future cash flows) from inception of the hedge.
the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge (ie the portion that is offset by the change in the cash flow hedge reserve calculated in accordance with (a)) shall be recognised in other comprehensive income.
any remaining gain or loss on the hedging instrument (or any gain or loss required to balance the change in the cash flow hedge reserve calculated in accordance with (a)) is hedge ineffectiveness that shall be recognised in profit or loss.
the amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance with (a) shall be accounted for as follows
if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, or a hedged forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability becomes a firm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied, the entity shall remove that amount from the cash flow hedge reserve and include it directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or the liability.
for cash flow hedges other than those covered by (i), that amount shall be reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1) in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss (for example, in the periods that interest income or interest expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs).
if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur, that amount shall remain in the cash flow hedge reserve until the future cash flows occur or until paragraph 6.5.11(d)(iii) applies.
When the future cash flows occur, paragraph 6.5.11(d) applies.
A hedged future cash flow that is no longer highly probable to occur may still be expected to occur.
an entity shall distinguish the time value of options by the type of hedged item that the option hedges (see paragraph B6.5.29)
a time-period related hedged item.
the change in fair value of the time value of an option that hedges a transaction related hedged item shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that it relates to the hedged item and shall be accumulated in a separate component of equity.
The cumulative change in fair value arising from the time value of the option that has been accumulated in a separate component of equity (the 'amount') shall be accounted for as follows
if the hedged item subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, or a firm commitment for a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability for which fair value hedge accounting is applied, the entity shall remove the amount from the separate component of equity and include it directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or the liability.
This is not a reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1) and hence does not affect other comprehensive income.
for hedging relationships other than those covered by (i), the amount shall be reclassified from the separate component of equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1) in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss (for example, when a forecast sale occurs).
the change in fair value of the time value of an option that hedges a time-period related hedged item shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that it relates to the hedged item and shall be accumulated in a separate component of equity.
Hence, in each reporting period, the amortisation amount shall be reclassified from the separate component of equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1).
However, if hedge accounting is discontinued for the hedging relationship that includes the change in intrinsic value of the option as the hedging instrument, the net amount (ie including cumulative amortisation) that has been accumulated in the separate component of equity shall be immediately reclassified into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1).
In that case, the entity shall apply the application guidance in paragraphs B6.5.34–B6.5.39.
Eligibility of a group of items as the hedged item
it consists of items (including components of items) that are, individually, eligible hedged items;
the items in the group are managed together on a group basis for risk management purposes; and
in the case of a cash flow hedge of a group of items whose variabilities in cash flows are not expected to be approximately proportional to the overall variability in cash flows of the group so that offsetting risk positions arise
it is a hedge of foreign currency risk; and
the designation of that net position specifies the reporting period in which the forecast transactions are expected to affect profit or loss, as well as their nature and volume (see paragraphs B6.6.7–B6.6.8).
Designation of a component of a nominal amount
it is separately identifiable and reliably measurable;
the risk management objective is to hedge a layer component;
the items in the overall group from which the layer is identified are exposed to the same hedged risk (so that the measurement of the hedged layer is not significantly affected by which particular items from the overall group form part of the hedged layer);
for a hedge of existing items (for example, an unrecognised firm commitment or a recognised asset) an entity can identify and track the overall group of items from which the hedged layer is defined (so that the entity is able to comply with the requirements for the accounting for qualifying hedging relationships); and
any items in the group that contain prepayment options meet the requirements for components of a nominal amount (see paragraph B6.3.20).
Hence, in that statement the amount in the line item that relates to the hedged item itself (for example, revenue or cost of sales) remains unaffected.
the hedge is part of a rolling net risk hedging strategy, whereby the entity routinely hedges new positions of the same type as time moves on (for example, when transactions move into the time horizon for which the entity hedges);
the hedged net position changes in size over the life of the rolling net risk hedging strategy and the entity uses eligible hedging instruments to hedge the net risk (ie when the net position is not nil);
not applying hedge accounting to the nil net position would give rise to inconsistent accounting outcomes, because the accounting would not recognise the offsetting risk positions that would otherwise be recognised in a hedge of a net position.
Eligibility of credit exposures for designation at fair value through profit or loss
the name of the credit exposure (for example, the borrower, or the holder of a loan commitment) matches the reference entity of the credit derivative ('name matching'); and
An entity may make this designation irrespective of whether the financial instrument that is managed for credit risk is within the scope of this Standard (for example, an entity may designate loan commitments that are outside the scope of this Standard).
The entity may designate that financial instrument at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unrecognised.
The entity shall document the designation concurrently.
Accounting for credit exposures designated at fair value through profit or loss
For financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income shall immediately be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (see IAS 1).
the credit derivative or the related financial instrument that gives rise to the credit risk expires or is sold, terminated or settled; or
the financial instrument that gives rise to the credit risk is not otherwise required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (ie the entity's business model has not changed in the meantime so that a reclassification in accordance with paragraph 4.4.1 was required).
Subsequently, the same measurement that was used before designating the financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss shall be applied (including amortisation that results from the new carrying amount).
For example, a financial asset that had originally been classified as measured at amortised cost would revert to that measurement and its effective interest rate would be recalculated based on its new gross carrying amount on the date of discontinuing measurement at fair value through profit or loss.

An entity shall apply that policy to all of its hedging relationships.
Any gain or loss from such a rebalancing shall be recognised in profit or loss.

In addition, if an entity elects retrospective application of this accounting, it shall be applied to all hedging relationships that qualify for this election (ie on transition this election is not available on a hedging-relationship-by-hedging-relationship basis).
shall apply retrospectively the requirement of paragraph 6.5.6 that there is not an expiration or termination of the hedging instrument if
This retrospective application applies only to those hedging relationships that existed at the beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies those requirements or were designated thereafter, and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve that existed at the beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies those requirements.

The entity may restate prior periods if, and only if, it is possible without the use of hindsight and the restated financial statements reflect all the requirements in this Standard.
the previous measurement category and carrying amount determined immediately before applying these amendments;
the new measurement category and carrying amount determined after applying these amendments;
the carrying amount of any financial assets and financial liabilities in the statement of financial position that were previously designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss but are no longer so designated; and
the reasons for any designation or de-designation of financial assets or financial liabilities as measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance.
Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired include observable data about the following events
(a)  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;
(b)  a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;
(e)  the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or
It may not be possible to identify a single discrete event — instead, the combined effect of several events may have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired.
The difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (ie all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets).
An entity shall estimate cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) through the expected life of that financial instrument.
The cash flows that are considered shall include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
There is a presumption that the expected life of a financial instrument can be estimated reliably.
However, in those rare cases when it is not possible to reliably estimate the expected life of a financial instrument, the entity shall use the remaining contractual term of the financial instrument.
The rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the amortised cost of a financial asset that is a purchased or originated credit-impaired financial asset.
When calculating the credit-adjusted effective interest rate, an entity shall estimate the expected cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial asset (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) and expected credit losses.
There is a presumption that the cash flows and the expected life of a group of similar financial instruments can be estimated reliably.
However, in those rare cases when it is not possible to reliably estimate the cash flows or the remaining life of a financial instrument (or group of financial instruments), the entity shall use the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).
The removal of a previously recognised financial asset or financial liability from an entity's statement of financial position.
(a)  its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract (sometimes called the 'underlying').
Distributions of profits to holders of equity instruments in proportion to their holdings of a particular class of capital.
The rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, an entity shall estimate the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but shall not consider the expected credit losses.
However, in those rare cases when it is not possible to reliably estimate the cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or group of financial instruments), the entity shall use the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).
(b)  upon initial recognition it is designated by the entity as at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 4.2.2 or 4.3.5.
A binding agreement for the exchange of a specified quantity of resources at a specified price on a specified future date or dates.
An uncommitted but anticipated future transaction.
The amortised cost of a financial asset, before adjusting for any loss allowance.
The relationship between the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item in terms of their relative weighting.
A financial asset or financial liability that
(a)  is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near term;
(b)  on initial recognition is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
(c)  is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument).
The expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.
The allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets measured in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2, lease receivables and contract assets, the accumulated impairment amount for financial assets measured in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A and the provision for expected credit losses on loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
The amount arising from adjusting the gross carrying amount of a financial asset to reflect the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows.
The entity recalculates the gross carrying amount of a financial asset as the present value of the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the renegotiated or modified financial asset that are discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (or the original credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets) or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.5.10.
When estimating the expected cash flows of a financial asset, an entity shall consider all contractual terms of the financial asset (for example, prepayment, call and similar options) but shall not consider the expected credit losses, unless the financial asset is a purchased or originated credit-impaired financial asset, in which case an entity shall also consider the initial expected credit losses that were considered when calculating the original credit-adjusted effective interest rate.
A financial asset is past due when a counterparty has failed to make a payment when that payment was contractually due.
purchased or originated credit-impaired financial asset
regular way purchase or sale
A purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract whose terms require delivery of the asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned.
Incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial asset or financial liability (see paragraph B5.4.8).
An incremental cost is one that would not have been incurred if the entity had not acquired, issued or disposed of the financial instrument.
Sometimes, an entity makes what it views as a 'strategic investment' in equity instruments issued by another entity, with the intention of establishing or maintaining a long-term operating relationship with the entity in which the investment is made.
If this Standard applies, paragraph 5.1.1 requires the issuer to recognise a financial guarantee contract initially at fair value.
If the financial guarantee contract was issued to an unrelated party in a stand-alone arm's length transaction, its fair value at inception is likely to equal the premium received, unless there is evidence to the contrary.
Subsequently, unless the financial guarantee contract was designated at inception as at fair value through profit or loss or unless paragraphs 3.2.15–3.2.23 and B3.2.12–B3.2.17 apply (when a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition or the continuing involvement approach applies), the issuer measures it at the higher of
Assertions that an issuer regards contracts as insurance contracts are typically found throughout the issuer's communications with customers and regulators, contracts, business documentation and financial statements.
Furthermore, insurance contracts are often subject to accounting requirements that are distinct from the requirements for other types of transaction, such as contracts issued by banks or commercial companies.
In such cases, an issuer's financial statements typically include a statement that the issuer has used those accounting requirements.
If a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition, the transferee does not recognise the transferred asset as its asset (see paragraph B3.2.15).
The following are examples of applying the principle in paragraph 3.1.1
A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets is recognised using either trade date accounting or settlement date accounting as described in paragraphs B3.1.5 and B3.1.6.
An entity shall apply the same method consistently for all purchases and sales of financial assets that are classified in the same way in accordance with this Standard.
For this purpose assets that are mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss form a separate classification from assets designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss.
A contract that requires or permits net settlement of the change in the value of the contract is not a regular way contract.
Instead, such a contract is accounted for as a derivative in the period between the trade date and the settlement date.
The trade date is the date that an entity commits itself to purchase or sell an asset.
Trade date accounting refers to (a) the recognition of an asset to be received and the liability to pay for it on the trade date, and (b) derecognition of an asset that is sold, recognition of any gain or loss on disposal and the recognition of a receivable from the buyer for payment on the trade date.
Generally, interest does not start to accrue on the asset and corresponding liability until the settlement date when title passes.
The settlement date is the date that an asset is delivered to or by an entity.
When settlement date accounting is applied an entity accounts for any change in the fair value of the asset to be received during the period between the trade date and the settlement date in the same way as it accounts for the acquired asset.
Derecognition of financial assets (Section 3.2)
The following flow chart illustrates the evaluation of whether and to what extent a financial asset is derecognised.
Examples of when an entity has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are
an unconditional sale of a financial asset;
a sale of a financial asset together with an option to repurchase the financial asset at its fair value at the time of repurchase; and
a sale of a financial asset together with a put or call option that is deeply out of the money (ie an option that is so far out of the money it is highly unlikely to go into the money before expiry).
Examples of when an entity has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are
a sale and repurchase transaction where the repurchase price is a fixed price or the sale price plus a lender's return;
a sale of a financial asset together with a total return swap that transfers the market risk exposure back to the entity;
a sale of a financial asset together with a deep in-the-money put or call option (ie an option that is so far in the money that it is highly unlikely to go out of the money before expiry); and
a sale of short-term receivables in which the entity guarantees to compensate the transferee for credit losses that are likely to occur.
If an entity determines that as a result of the transfer, it has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, it does not recognise the transferred asset again in a future period, unless it reacquires the transferred asset in a new transaction.
Evaluation of the transfer of control
An entity has not retained control of a transferred asset if the transferee has the practical ability to sell the transferred asset.
An entity has retained control of a transferred asset if the transferee does not have the practical ability to sell the transferred asset.
A transferee has the practical ability to sell the transferred asset if it is traded in an active market because the transferee could repurchase the transferred asset in the market if it needs to return the asset to the entity.
For example, a transferee may have the practical ability to sell a transferred asset if the transferred asset is subject to an option that allows the entity to repurchase it, but the transferee can readily obtain the transferred asset in the market if the option is exercised.
A transferee does not have the practical ability to sell the transferred asset if the entity retains such an option and the transferee cannot readily obtain the transferred asset in the market if the entity exercises its option.
The critical question is what the transferee is able to do in practice, not what contractual rights the transferee has concerning what it can do with the transferred asset or what contractual prohibitions exist.
a contractual right to dispose of the transferred asset has little practical effect if there is no market for the transferred asset, and
an ability to dispose of the transferred asset has little practical effect if it cannot be exercised freely.
the transferee's ability to dispose of the transferred asset must be independent of the actions of others (ie it must be a unilateral ability), and
the transferee must be able to dispose of the transferred asset without needing to attach restrictive conditions or 'strings' to the transfer (eg conditions about how a loan asset is serviced or an option giving the transferee the right to repurchase the asset).
However, if a put option or guarantee constrains the transferee from selling the transferred asset, then the transferor has retained control of the transferred asset.
Instead, the transferee would hold the transferred asset so as to obtain payments under the guarantee or put option.
Under these circumstances the transferor has retained control of the transferred asset.
An entity may retain the right to a part of the interest payments on transferred assets as compensation for servicing those assets.
The part of the interest payments that the entity would give up upon termination or transfer of the servicing contract is allocated to the servicing asset or servicing liability.
The part of the interest payments that the entity would not give up is an interest-only strip receivable.
For example, if the entity would not give up any interest upon termination or transfer of the servicing contract, the entire interest spread is an interest-only strip receivable.
If there is no servicing fee specified or the fee to be received is not expected to compensate the entity adequately for performing the servicing, a liability for the servicing obligation is recognised at fair value.
The following is an application of the principle outlined in paragraph 3.2.15.
If a guarantee provided by the entity for default losses on the transferred asset prevents a transferred asset from being derecognised because the entity has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in its entirety and the consideration received is recognised as a liability.
The following are examples of how an entity measures a transferred asset and the associated liability under paragraph 3.2.16.
The associated liability is initially measured at the guarantee amount plus the fair value of the guarantee (which is normally the consideration received for the guarantee).
Subsequently, the initial fair value of the guarantee is recognised in profit or loss when (or as) the obligation is satisfied (in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15) and the carrying value of the asset is reduced by any loss allowance.
Assets measured at amortised cost
If the option is exercised, any difference between the carrying amount of the associated liability and the exercise price is recognised in profit or loss.
Assets measured at fair value
The adjustment to the measurement of the associated liability ensures that the net carrying amount of the asset and the associated liability is the fair value of the call option right.
The measurement of the asset at fair value is limited to the lower of the fair value and the option exercise price because the entity has no right to increases in the fair value of the transferred asset above the exercise price of the option.
This ensures that the net carrying amount of the asset and the associated liability is the fair value of the put option obligation.
The adjustment to the associated liability ensures that the net carrying amount of the asset and the associated liability is the fair value of the options held and written by the entity.
To the extent that a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition, the transferor's contractual rights or obligations related to the transfer are not accounted for separately as derivatives if recognising both the derivative and either the transferred asset or the liability arising from the transfer would result in recognising the same rights or obligations twice.
For example, a call option retained by the transferor may prevent a transfer of financial assets from being accounted for as a sale.
In that case, the call option is not separately recognised as a derivative asset.
To the extent that a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition, the transferee does not recognise the transferred asset as its asset.
If the transferor has both a right and an obligation to reacquire control of the entire transferred asset for a fixed amount (such as under a repurchase agreement), the transferee may measure its receivable at amortised cost if it meets the criteria in paragraph 4.1.2.
The following examples illustrate the application of the derecognition principles of this Standard.
If the transferee obtains the right to sell or pledge the asset, the transferor reclassifies the asset in its statement of financial position, for example, as a loaned asset or repurchase receivable.
If a financial asset is sold under an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same asset at a fixed price or at the sale price plus a lender's return or if a financial asset is borrowed or loaned under an agreement to return the same or substantially the same asset to the transferor, it is not derecognised because the transferor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
If a repurchase agreement at a fixed repurchase price or a price equal to the sale price plus a lender's return, or a similar securities lending transaction, provides the transferee with a right to substitute assets that are similar and of equal fair value to the transferred asset at the repurchase date, the asset sold or lent under a repurchase or securities lending transaction is not derecognised because the transferor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
The repurchase of a financial asset shortly after it has been sold is sometimes referred to as a wash sale.
Such a repurchase does not preclude derecognition provided that the original transaction met the derecognition requirements.
However, if an agreement to sell a financial asset is entered into concurrently with an agreement to repurchase the same asset at a fixed price or the sale price plus a lender's return, then the asset is not derecognised.
If a transferred financial asset can be called back by the transferor and the call option is deeply in the money, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition because the transferor has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Similarly, if the financial asset can be put back by the transferee and the put option is deeply in the money, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition because the transferor has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
If an entity holds a call option on an asset that is readily obtainable in the market and the option is neither deeply in the money nor deeply out of the money, the asset is derecognised.
This is because the entity (i) has neither retained nor transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, and (ii) has not retained control.
However, if the asset is not readily obtainable in the market, derecognition is precluded to the extent of the amount of the asset that is subject to the call option because the entity has retained control of the asset.
If an entity transfers a financial asset that is not readily obtainable in the market, and writes a put option that is not deeply out of the money, the entity neither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership because of the written put option.
The entity transfers control of the asset if the put option is not sufficiently valuable to prevent the transferee from selling the asset, in which case the asset is derecognised.
A transfer of a financial asset that is subject only to a put or call option or a forward repurchase agreement that has an exercise or repurchase price equal to the fair value of the financial asset at the time of repurchase results in derecognition because of the transfer of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
An entity evaluates the transfer of a financial asset that is subject to a put or call option or a forward repurchase agreement that will be settled net in cash to determine whether it has retained or transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
If the entity has not retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, it determines whether it has retained control of the transferred asset.
Provided that such an option results in the entity neither retaining nor transferring substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, it precludes derecognition only to the extent of the amount subject to repurchase (assuming that the transferee cannot sell the assets).
Provided that such a clean-up call results in the entity neither retaining nor transferring substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the transferee cannot sell the assets, it precludes derecognition only to the extent of the amount of the assets that is subject to the call option.
An entity may provide the transferee with credit enhancement by subordinating some or all of its interest retained in the transferred asset.
Alternatively, an entity may provide the transferee with credit enhancement in the form of a credit guarantee that could be unlimited or limited to a specified amount.
If the entity retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, the asset continues to be recognised in its entirety.
If the entity retains some, but not substantially all, of the risks and rewards of ownership and has retained control, derecognition is precluded to the extent of the amount of cash or other assets that the entity could be required to pay.
An entity may sell a financial asset to a transferee and enter into a total return swap with the transferee, whereby all of the interest payment cash flows from the underlying asset are remitted to the entity in exchange for a fixed payment or variable rate payment and any increases or declines in the fair value of the underlying asset are absorbed by the entity.
In such a case, derecognition of all of the asset is prohibited.
An entity may transfer to a transferee a fixed rate financial asset and enter into an interest rate swap with the transferee to receive a fixed interest rate and pay a variable interest rate based on a notional amount that is equal to the principal amount of the transferred financial asset.
The interest rate swap does not preclude derecognition of the transferred asset provided the payments on the swap are not conditional on payments being made on the transferred asset.
An entity may transfer to a transferee a fixed rate financial asset that is paid off over time, and enter into an amortising interest rate swap with the transferee to receive a fixed interest rate and pay a variable interest rate based on a notional amount.
If the notional amount of the swap amortises so that it equals the principal amount of the transferred financial asset outstanding at any point in time, the swap would generally result in the entity retaining substantial prepayment risk, in which case the entity either continues to recognise all of the transferred asset or continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.
Conversely, if the amortisation of the notional amount of the swap is not linked to the principal amount outstanding of the transferred asset, such a swap would not result in the entity retaining prepayment risk on the asset.
Hence, it would not preclude derecognition of the transferred asset provided the payments on the swap are not conditional on interest payments being made on the transferred asset and the swap does not result in the entity retaining any other significant risks and rewards of ownership on the transferred asset.
An entity has no reasonable expectations of recovering the contractual cash flows on a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof.
This paragraph illustrates the application of the continuing involvement approach when the entity's continuing involvement is in a part of a financial asset.
The entity determines that it has transferred some significant risks and rewards of ownership (for example, significant prepayment risk) but has also retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership (because of its subordinated retained interest) and has retained control.
It therefore applies the continuing involvement approach.
The remainder of the consideration received (CU25) represents consideration received for subordinating its retained interest to provide credit enhancement to the transferee for credit losses.
In addition, the entity recognises the continuing involvement that results from the subordination of its retained interest for credit losses.
The entity uses all of the above information to account for the transaction as follows
Asset recognised for subordination or the residual interest
Asset for the consideration received in the form of excess spread
Profit or loss (gain on transfer)
In subsequent periods, the entity recognises the consideration received for the credit enhancement (CU65) on a time proportion basis, accrues interest on the recognised asset using the effective interest method and recognises any impairment losses on the recognised assets.
Derecognition of financial liabilities (Section 3.3)
A financial liability (or part of it) is extinguished when the debtor either
discharges the liability (or part of it) by paying the creditor, normally with cash, other financial assets, goods or services; or
is legally released from primary responsibility for the liability (or part of it) either by process of law or by the creditor.
If an issuer of a debt instrument repurchases that instrument, the debt is extinguished even if the issuer is a market maker in that instrument or intends to resell it in the near term.
If those criteria are not met, the transferred assets are not derecognised, and the entity recognises a new liability relating to the transferred assets.
If an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment.
If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability.
In some cases, a creditor releases a debtor from its present obligation to make payments, but the debtor assumes a guarantee obligation to pay if the party assuming primary responsibility defaults.
In these circumstances the debtor
recognises a new financial liability based on the fair value of its obligation for the guarantee, and
Classification of financial assets (Section 4.1)
The entity's business model for managing financial assets
An entity's business model is determined at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective.
The entity's business model does not depend on management's intentions for an individual instrument.
Accordingly, this condition is not an instrument-by-instrument approach to classification and should be determined on a higher level of aggregation.
Consequently, classification need not be determined at the reporting entity level.
For example, an entity may hold a portfolio of investments that it manages in order to collect contractual cash flows and another portfolio of investments that it manages in order to trade to realise fair value changes.
Similarly, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate to separate a portfolio of financial assets into subportfolios in order to reflect the level at which an entity manages those financial assets.
For example, that may be the case if an entity originates or purchases a portfolio of mortgage loans and manages some of the loans with an objective of collecting contractual cash flows and manages the other loans with an objective of selling them.
An entity's business model refers to how an entity manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows.
That is, the entity's business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling financial assets or both.
Consequently, this assessment is not performed on the basis of scenarios that the entity does not reasonably expect to occur, such as so-called 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios.
For example, if an entity expects that it will sell a particular portfolio of financial assets only in a stress case scenario, that scenario would not affect the entity's assessment of the business model for those assets if the entity reasonably expects that such a scenario will not occur.
However, when an entity assesses the business model for newly originated or newly purchased financial assets, it must consider information about how cash flows were realised in the past, along with all other relevant information.
An entity's business model for managing financial assets is a matter of fact and not merely an assertion.
It is typically observable through the activities that the entity undertakes to achieve the objective of the business model.
An entity will need to use judgement when it assesses its business model for managing financial assets and that assessment is not determined by a single factor or activity.
Instead, the entity must consider all relevant evidence that is available at the date of the assessment.
Such relevant evidence includes, but is not limited to
how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity's key management personnel;
the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way in which those risks are managed; and
how managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).
A business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows are managed to realise cash flows by collecting contractual payments over the life of the instrument.
That is, the entity manages the assets held within the portfolio to collect those particular contractual cash flows (instead of managing the overall return on the portfolio by both holding and selling assets).
In determining whether cash flows are going to be realised by collecting the financial assets' contractual cash flows, it is necessary to consider the frequency, value and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for those sales and expectations about future sales activity.
However sales in themselves do not determine the business model and therefore cannot be considered in isolation.
Instead, information about past sales and expectations about future sales provide evidence related to how the entity's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and, specifically, how cash flows are realised.
An entity must consider information about past sales within the context of the reasons for those sales and the conditions that existed at that time as compared to current conditions.
Although the objective of an entity's business model may be to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, the entity need not hold all of those instruments until maturity.
Thus an entity's business model can be to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows even when sales of financial assets occur or are expected to occur in the future.
The business model may be to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows even if the entity sells financial assets when there is an increase in the assets' credit risk.
To determine whether there has been an increase in the assets' credit risk, the entity considers reasonable and supportable information, including forward looking information.
Irrespective of their frequency and value, sales due to an increase in the assets' credit risk are not inconsistent with a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows because the credit quality of financial assets is relevant to the entity's ability to collect contractual cash flows.
Credit risk management activities that are aimed at minimising potential credit losses due to credit deterioration are integral to such a business model.
Selling a financial asset because it no longer meets the credit criteria specified in the entity's documented investment policy is an example of a sale that has occurred due to an increase in credit risk.
However, in the absence of such a policy, the entity may demonstrate in other ways that the sale occurred due to an increase in credit risk.
Sales that occur for other reasons, such as sales made to manage credit concentration risk (without an increase in the assets' credit risk), may also be consistent with a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
In particular, such sales may be consistent with a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows if those sales are infrequent (even if significant in value) or insignificant in value both individually and in aggregate (even if frequent).
An increase in the frequency or value of sales in a particular period is not necessarily inconsistent with an objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, if an entity can explain the reasons for those sales and demonstrate why those sales do not reflect a change in the entity's business model.
The following are examples of when the objective of an entity's business model may be to hold financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows.
An entity holds investments to collect their contractual cash flows.
The funding needs of the entity are predictable and the maturity of its financial assets is matched to the entity's estimated funding needs.
The entity performs credit risk management activities with the objective of minimising credit losses.
In the past, sales have typically occurred when the financial assets' credit risk has increased such that the assets no longer meet the credit criteria specified in the entity's documented investment policy.
In addition, infrequent sales have occurred as a result of unanticipated funding needs.
Reports to key management personnel focus on the credit quality of the financial assets and the contractual return.
The entity also monitors fair values of the financial assets, among other information.
Although the entity considers, among other information, the financial assets' fair values from a liquidity perspective (ie the cash amount that would be realised if the entity needs to sell assets), the entity's objective is to hold the financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows.
Sales would not contradict that objective if they were in response to an increase in the assets' credit risk, for example if the assets no longer meet the credit criteria specified in the entity's documented investment policy.
An entity's business model is to purchase portfolios of financial assets, such as loans.
Those portfolios may or may not include financial assets that are credit impaired.
If payment on the loans is not made on a timely basis, the entity attempts to realise the contractual cash flows through various means — for example, by contacting the debtor by mail, telephone or other methods.
In some cases, the entity enters into interest rate swaps to change the interest rate on particular financial assets in a portfolio from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate.
The objective of the entity's business model is to hold the financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows.
Moreover, the fact that the entity enters into derivatives to modify the cash flows of the portfolio does not in itself change the entity's business model.
The originating entity controls the securitisation vehicle and thus consolidates it.
The securitisation vehicle collects the contractual cash flows from the loans and passes them on to its investors.
It is assumed for the purposes of this example that the loans continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position because they are not derecognised by the securitisation vehicle.
The consolidated group originated the loans with the objective of holding them to collect the contractual cash flows.
The entity does not anticipate selling these assets except in such scenarios.
The entity monitors the credit quality of the financial assets and its objective in managing the financial assets is to collect the contractual cash flows.
The entity evaluates the performance of the assets on the basis of interest revenue earned and credit losses realised.
However, the entity also monitors the fair value of the financial assets from a liquidity perspective to ensure that the cash amount that would be realised if the entity needed to sell the assets in a stress case scenario would be sufficient to meet the entity's liquidity needs.
Periodically, the entity makes sales that are insignificant in value to demonstrate liquidity.
The objective of the entity's business model is to hold the financial assets to collect contractual cash flows.
The analysis would not change even if during a previous stress case scenario the entity had sales that were significant in value in order to meet its liquidity needs.
Similarly, recurring sales activity that is insignificant in value is not inconsistent with holding financial assets to collect contractual cash flows.
In contrast, if an entity holds financial assets to meet its everyday liquidity needs and meeting that objective involves frequent sales that are significant in value, the objective of the entity's business model is not to hold the financial assets to collect contractual cash flows.
Similarly, if the entity is required by its regulator to routinely sell financial assets to demonstrate that the assets are liquid, and the value of the assets sold is significant, the entity's business model is not to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows.
A business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
An entity may hold financial assets in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
In this type of business model, the entity's key management personnel have made a decision that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving the objective of the business model.
There are various objectives that may be consistent with this type of business model.
For example, the objective of the business model may be to manage everyday liquidity needs, to maintain a particular interest yield profile or to match the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that those assets are funding.
To achieve such an objective, the entity will both collect contractual cash flows and sell financial assets.
Compared to a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows, this business model will typically involve greater frequency and value of sales.
This is because selling financial assets is integral to achieving the business model's objective instead of being only incidental to it.
However, there is no threshold for the frequency or value of sales that must occur in this business model because both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving its objective.
The following are examples of when the objective of the entity's business model may be achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
The entity invests its excess cash in short- and long-term financial assets so that it can fund the expenditure when the need arises.
Many of the financial assets have contractual lives that exceed the entity's anticipated investment period.
The entity will hold financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows and, when an opportunity arises, it will sell financial assets to reinvest the cash in financial assets with a higher return.
The managers responsible for the portfolio are remunerated based on the overall return generated by the portfolio.
The objective of the business model is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
The entity will make decisions on an ongoing basis about whether collecting contractual cash flows or selling financial assets will maximise the return on the portfolio until the need arises for the invested cash.
When the investments mature, the entity reinvests the cash in new short-term financial assets.
The entity maintains this strategy until the funds are needed, at which time the entity uses the proceeds from the maturing financial assets to fund the capital expenditure.
The objective of this contrasting business model is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows.
A financial institution holds financial assets to meet its everyday liquidity needs.
The entity seeks to minimise the costs of managing those liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio.
That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets.
As a result, the entity holds financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and sells financial assets to reinvest in higher yielding financial assets or to better match the duration of its liabilities.
In other words, both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving the business model's objective.
An insurer holds financial assets in order to fund insurance contract liabilities.
The insurer uses the proceeds from the contractual cash flows on the financial assets to settle insurance contract liabilities as they come due.
To ensure that the contractual cash flows from the financial assets are sufficient to settle those liabilities, the insurer undertakes significant buying and selling activity on a regular basis to rebalance its portfolio of assets and to meet cash flow needs as they arise.
The objective of the business model is to fund the insurance contract liabilities.
To achieve this objective, the entity collects contractual cash flows as they come due and sells financial assets to maintain the desired profile of the asset portfolio.
Thus both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving the business model's objective.
The entity makes decisions based on the assets' fair values and manages the assets to realise those fair values.
In this case, the entity's objective will typically result in active buying and selling.
Even though the entity will collect contractual cash flows while it holds the financial assets, the objective of such a business model is not achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
This is because the collection of contractual cash flows is not integral to achieving the business model's objective; instead, it is incidental to it.
A portfolio of financial assets that is managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis (as described in paragraph 4.2.2(b)) is neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.
The entity is primarily focused on fair value information and uses that information to assess the assets' performance and to make decisions.
In addition, a portfolio of financial assets that meets the definition of held for trading is not held to collect contractual cash flows or held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.
For such portfolios, the collection of contractual cash flows is only incidental to achieving the business model's objective.
Consequently, such portfolios of financial assets must be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding
However, in such an arrangement, interest can also include consideration for other basic lending risks (for example, liquidity risk) and costs (for example, administrative costs) associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time.
In addition, interest can include a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement.
In extreme economic circumstances, interest can be negative if, for example, the holder of a financial asset either explicitly or implicitly pays for the deposit of its money for a particular period of time (and that fee exceeds the consideration that the holder receives for the time value of money, credit risk and other basic lending risks and costs).
However, contractual terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that is unrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity prices or commodity prices, do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
An originated or a purchased financial asset can be a basic lending arrangement irrespective of whether it is a loan in its legal form.
In accordance with paragraph 4.1.3(a), principal is the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition.
However that principal amount may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal).
An entity shall assess whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding for the currency in which the financial asset is denominated.
Leverage is a contractual cash flow characteristic of some financial assets.
Leverage increases the variability of the contractual cash flows with the result that they do not have the economic characteristics of interest.
Stand-alone option, forward and swap contracts are examples of financial assets that include such leverage.
Consideration for the time value of money
Time value of money is the element of interest that provides consideration for only the passage of time.
That is, the time value of money element does not provide consideration for other risks or costs associated with holding the financial asset.
In order to assess whether the element provides consideration for only the passage of time, an entity applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated and the period for which the interest rate is set.
However, in some cases, the time value of money element may be modified (ie imperfect).
In such cases, an entity must assess the modification to determine whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
In some circumstances, the entity may be able to make that determination by performing a qualitative assessment of the time value of money element whereas, in other circumstances, it may be necessary to perform a quantitative assessment.
To make this determination, the entity must consider the effect of the modified time value of money element in each reporting period and cumulatively over the life of the financial instrument.
The reason for the interest rate being set in this way is not relevant to the analysis.
When assessing a modified time value of money element, an entity must consider factors that could affect future contractual cash flows.
However, an entity must consider only reasonably possible scenarios instead of every possible scenario.
In some jurisdictions, the government or a regulatory authority sets interest rates.
For example, such government regulation of interest rates may be part of a broad macroeconomic policy or it may be introduced to encourage entities to invest in a particular sector of the economy.
In some of these cases, the objective of the time value of money element is not to provide consideration for only the passage of time.
Contractual terms that change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows
If a financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows (for example, if the asset can be prepaid before maturity or its term can be extended), the entity must determine whether the contractual cash flows that could arise over the life of the instrument due to that contractual term are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
To make this determination, the entity must assess the contractual cash flows that could arise both before, and after, the change in contractual cash flows.
The entity may also need to assess the nature of any contingent event (ie the trigger) that would change the timing or amount of the contractual cash flows.
While the nature of the contingent event in itself is not a determinative factor in assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, it may be an indicator.
For example, compare a financial instrument with an interest rate that is reset to a higher rate if the debtor misses a particular number of payments to a financial instrument with an interest rate that is reset to a higher rate if a specified equity index reaches a particular level.
The following are examples of contractual terms that result in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding
a variable interest rate that consists of consideration for the time value of money, the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time (the consideration for credit risk may be determined at initial recognition only, and so may be fixed) and other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin;
a contractual term that permits the issuer (ie the debtor) to prepay a debt instrument or permits the holder (ie the creditor) to put a debt instrument back to the issuer before maturity and the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract; and
a contractual term that permits the issuer or the holder to extend the contractual term of a debt instrument (ie an extension option) and the terms of the extension option result in contractual cash flows during the extension period that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for the extension of the contract.
the entity acquires or originates the financial asset at a premium or discount to the contractual par amount;
the prepayment amount substantially represents the contractual par amount and accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest, which may include reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract; and
when the entity initially recognises the financial asset, the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant.
For example, a party may pay or receive reasonable compensation when it chooses to terminate the contract early (or otherwise causes the early termination to occur).
The following examples illustrate contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
This list of examples is not exhaustive.
Instrument A is a bond with a stated maturity date.
Payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are linked to an inflation index of the currency in which the instrument is issued.
The inflation link is not leveraged and the principal is protected.
The contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Thus, the interest amounts are consideration for the time value of money on the principal amount outstanding.
However, if the interest payments were indexed to another variable such as the debtor's performance (eg the debtor's net income) or an equity index, the contractual cash flows are not payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (unless the indexing to the debtor's performance results in an adjustment that only compensates the holder for changes in the credit risk of the instrument, such that contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest).
That is because the contractual cash flows reflect a return that is inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement (see paragraph B4.1.7A).
Instrument B is a variable interest rate instrument with a stated maturity date that permits the borrower to choose the market interest rate on an ongoing basis.
The contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding as long as the interest paid over the life of the instrument reflects consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the instrument and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin (see paragraph B4.1.7A).
The fact that the LIBOR interest rate is reset during the life of the instrument does not in itself disqualify the instrument.
Consequently, the time value of money element is modified.
That is because the interest payable in each period is disconnected from the interest period.
Instrument C is a bond with a stated maturity date and pays a variable market interest rate.
That variable interest rate is capped.
The contractual cash flows of both
(a)  an instrument that has a fixed interest rate and
(b)  an instrument that has a variable interest rate
Consequently, an instrument that is a combination of (a) and (b) (eg a bond with an interest rate cap) can have cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Such a contractual term may reduce cash flow variability by setting a limit on a variable interest rate (eg an interest rate cap or floor) or increase the cash flow variability because a fixed rate becomes variable.
Instrument D is a full recourse loan and is secured by collateral.
The fact that a full recourse loan is collateralised does not in itself affect the analysis of whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Instrument E is issued by a regulated bank and has a stated maturity date.
The instrument pays a fixed interest rate and all contractual cash flows are non-discretionary.
However, the issuer is subject to legislation that permits or requires a national resolving authority to impose losses on holders of particular instruments, including Instrument E, in particular circumstances.
For example, the national resolving authority has the power to write down the par amount of Instrument E or to convert it into a fixed number of the issuer's ordinary shares if the national resolving authority determines that the issuer is having severe financial difficulties, needs additional regulatory capital or is 'failing'.
The holder would analyse the contractual terms of the financial instrument to determine whether they give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and thus are consistent with a basic lending arrangement.
In contrast, the contractual cash flows would not be solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding if the contractual terms of the financial instrument permit or require the issuer or another entity to impose losses on the holder (eg by writing down the par amount or by converting the instrument into a fixed number of the issuer's ordinary shares) as long as those contractual terms are genuine, even if the probability is remote that such a loss will be imposed.
The following examples illustrate contractual cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Instrument F is a bond that is convertible into a fixed number of equity instruments of the issuer.
The holder would analyse the convertible bond in its entirety.
Instrument G is a loan that pays an inverse floating interest rate (ie the interest rate has an inverse relationship to market interest rates).
The contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
The interest amounts are not consideration for the time value of money on the principal amount outstanding.
Instrument H is a perpetual instrument but the issuer may call the instrument at any point and pay the holder the par amount plus accrued interest due.
Instrument H pays a market interest rate but payment of interest cannot be made unless the issuer is able to remain solvent immediately afterwards.
Deferred interest does not accrue additional interest.
The contractual cash flows are not payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
As a result, interest amounts are not consideration for the time value of money on the principal amount outstanding.
The fact that Instrument H is perpetual does not in itself mean that the contractual cash flows are not payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
In effect, a perpetual instrument has continuous (multiple) extension options.
Such options may result in contractual cash flows that are payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding if interest payments are mandatory and must be paid in perpetuity.
Also, the fact that Instrument H is callable does not mean that the contractual cash flows are not payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding unless it is callable at an amount that does not substantially reflect payment of outstanding principal and interest on that principal amount outstanding.
This could be the case when a creditor's claim is limited to specified assets of the debtor or the cash flows from specified assets (for example, a 'non-recourse' financial asset).
Whether the underlying assets are financial assets or non-financial assets does not in itself affect this assessment.
A contractual cash flow characteristic does not affect the classification of the financial asset if it could have only a de minimis effect on the contractual cash flows of the financial asset.
To make this determination, an entity must consider the possible effect of the contractual cash flow characteristic in each reporting period and cumulatively over the life of the financial instrument.
In addition, if a contractual cash flow characteristic could have an effect on the contractual cash flows that is more than de minimis (either in a single reporting period or cumulatively) but that cash flow characteristic is not genuine, it does not affect the classification of a financial asset.
A cash flow characteristic is not genuine if it affects the instrument's contractual cash flows only on the occurrence of an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely to occur.
In almost every lending transaction the creditor's instrument is ranked relative to the instruments of the debtor's other creditors.
An instrument that is subordinated to other instruments may have contractual cash flows that are payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding if the debtor's non-payment is a breach of contract and the holder has a contractual right to unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding even in the event of the debtor's bankruptcy.
For example, a trade receivable that ranks its creditor as a general creditor would qualify as having payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
This is the case even if the debtor issued loans that are collateralised, which in the event of bankruptcy would give that loan holder priority over the claims of the general creditor in respect of the collateral but does not affect the contractual right of the general creditor to unpaid principal and other amounts due.
In some types of transactions, an issuer may prioritise payments to the holders of financial assets using multiple contractually linked instruments that create concentrations of credit risk (tranches).
Each tranche has a subordination ranking that specifies the order in which any cash flows generated by the issuer are allocated to the tranche.
In such situations, the holders of a tranche have the right to payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding only if the issuer generates sufficient cash flows to satisfy higher-ranking tranches.
In such transactions, a tranche has cash flow characteristics that are payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding only if
the underlying pool of financial instruments has the cash flow characteristics set out in paragraphs B4.1.23 and B4.1.24; and
the exposure to credit risk in the underlying pool of financial instruments inherent in the tranche is equal to or lower than the exposure to credit risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments (for example, the credit rating of the tranche being assessed for classification is equal to or higher than the credit rating that would apply to a single tranche that funded the underlying pool of financial instruments).
The underlying pool of instruments may also include instruments that
reduce the cash flow variability of the instruments in paragraph B4.1.23 and, when combined with the instruments in paragraph B4.1.23, result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (eg an interest rate cap or floor or a contract that reduces the credit risk on some or all of the instruments in paragraph B4.1.23); or
align the cash flows of the tranches with the cash flows of the pool of underlying instruments in paragraph B4.1.23 to address differences in and only in
whether the interest rate is fixed or floating;
the currency in which the cash flows are denominated, including inflation in that currency; or
(iii) the timing of the cash flows.
In performing this assessment, a detailed instrument-by-instrument analysis of the pool may not be necessary.
However, an entity must use judgement and perform sufficient analysis to determine whether the instruments in the pool meet the conditions in paragraphs B4.1.23–B4.1.24.
If the holder cannot assess the conditions in paragraph B4.1.21 at initial recognition, the tranche must be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
However, if the underlying pool includes instruments that are collateralised by assets that do not meet the conditions in paragraphs B4.1.23–B4.1.24, the ability to take possession of such assets shall be disregarded for the purposes of applying this paragraph unless the entity acquired the tranche with the intention of controlling the collateral.
The decision of an entity to designate a financial asset or financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss is similar to an accounting policy choice (although, unlike an accounting policy choice, it is not required to be applied consistently to all similar transactions).
Measurement of a financial asset or financial liability and classification of recognised changes in its value are determined by the item's classification and whether the item is part of a designated hedging relationship.
Those requirements can create a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as an 'accounting mismatch') when, for example, in the absence of designation as at fair value through profit or loss, a financial asset would be classified as subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and a liability the entity considers related would be subsequently measured at amortised cost (with changes in fair value not recognised).
In such circumstances, an entity may conclude that its financial statements would provide more relevant information if both the asset and the liability were measured as at fair value through profit or loss.
The following examples show when this condition could be met.
However, only some of the instruments would be measured at fair value through profit or loss (for example, those that are derivatives, or are classified as held for trading).
Furthermore, in the absence of hedge accounting there is a significant inconsistency in the recognition of gains and losses.
For example, the entity has financed a specified group of loans by issuing traded bonds whose changes in fair value tend to offset each other.
In cases such as those described in the preceding paragraph, to designate, at initial recognition, the financial assets and financial liabilities not otherwise so measured as at fair value through profit or loss may eliminate or significantly reduce the measurement or recognition inconsistency and produce more relevant information.
For practical purposes, the entity need not enter into all of the assets and liabilities giving rise to the measurement or recognition inconsistency at exactly the same time.
A reasonable delay is permitted provided that each transaction is designated as at fair value through profit or loss at its initial recognition and, at that time, any remaining transactions are expected to occur.
It would not be acceptable to designate only some of the financial assets and financial liabilities giving rise to the inconsistency as at fair value through profit or loss if to do so would not eliminate or significantly reduce the inconsistency and would therefore not result in more relevant information.
However, it would be acceptable to designate only some of a number of similar financial assets or similar financial liabilities if doing so achieves a significant reduction (and possibly a greater reduction than other allowable designations) in the inconsistency.
A group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis
An entity may manage and evaluate the performance of a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities in such a way that measuring that group at fair value through profit or loss results in more relevant information.
The focus in this instance is on the way the entity manages and evaluates performance, instead of on the nature of its financial instruments.
For example, an entity may use this condition to designate financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss if it meets the principle in paragraph 4.2.2(b) and the entity has financial assets and financial liabilities that share one or more risks and those risks are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented policy of asset and liability management.
An example could be an entity that has issued 'structured products' containing multiple embedded derivatives and manages the resulting risks on a fair value basis using a mix of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
As noted above, this condition relies on the way the entity manages and evaluates performance of the group of financial instruments under consideration.
Accordingly, (subject to the requirement of designation at initial recognition) an entity that designates financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of this condition shall so designate all eligible financial liabilities that are managed and evaluated together.
Such documentation is not required for each individual item, but may be on a portfolio basis.
For example, if the performance management system for a department — as approved by the entity's key management personnel — clearly demonstrates that its performance is evaluated on this basis, no further documentation is required to demonstrate compliance with paragraph 4.2.2(b).
When an entity becomes a party to a hybrid contract with a host that is not an asset within the scope of this Standard, paragraph 4.3.3 requires the entity to identify any embedded derivative, assess whether it is required to be separated from the host contract and, for those that are required to be separated, measure the derivatives at fair value at initial recognition and subsequently at fair value through profit or loss.
If the host contract is not an equity instrument and meets the definition of a financial instrument, then its economic characteristics and risks are those of a debt instrument.
An embedded option-based derivative (such as an embedded put, call, cap, floor or swaption) is separated from its host contract on the basis of the stated terms of the option feature.
The initial carrying amount of the host instrument is the residual amount after separating the embedded derivative.
Generally, multiple embedded derivatives in a single hybrid contract are treated as a single compound embedded derivative.
The economic characteristics and risks of an embedded derivative are not closely related to the host contract (paragraph 4.3.3(a)) in the following examples.
the option's exercise price is approximately equal on each exercise date to the amortised cost of the host debt instrument or the carrying amount of the host insurance contract; or
the exercise price of a prepayment option reimburses the lender for an amount up to the approximate present value of lost interest for the remaining term of the host contract.
Lost interest is the product of the principal amount prepaid multiplied by the interest rate differential.
The interest rate differential is the excess of the effective interest rate of the host contract over the effective interest rate the entity would receive at the prepayment date if it reinvested the principal amount prepaid in a similar contract for the remaining term of the host contract.
Such credit derivatives allow the guarantor to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly owning it.
An example of a hybrid contract is a financial instrument that gives the holder a right to put the financial instrument back to the issuer in exchange for an amount of cash or other financial assets that varies on the basis of the change in an equity or commodity index that may increase or decrease (a 'puttable instrument').
Unless the issuer on initial recognition designates the puttable instrument as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss, it is required to separate an embedded derivative (ie the indexed principal payment) under paragraph 4.3.3 because the host contract is a debt instrument under paragraph B4.3.2 and the indexed principal payment is not closely related to a host debt instrument under paragraph B4.3.5(a).
Because the principal payment can increase and decrease, the embedded derivative is a non-option derivative whose value is indexed to the underlying variable.
The economic characteristics and risks of an embedded derivative are closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract in the following examples.
In these examples, an entity does not account for the embedded derivative separately from the host contract.
(iii) a currency that is commonly used in contracts to purchase or sell non-financial items in the economic environment in which the transaction takes place (eg a relatively stable and liquid currency that is commonly used in local business transactions or external trade).
A unit-linking feature is a contractual term that requires payments denominated in units of an internal or external investment fund.
These requirements can be more complex, or result in less reliable measures, than measuring the entire instrument at fair value through profit or loss.
For that reason this Standard permits the entire hybrid contract to be designated as at fair value through profit or loss.
Such designation may be used whether paragraph 4.3.3 requires the embedded derivatives to be separated from the host contract or prohibits such separation.
However, paragraph 4.3.5 would not justify designating the hybrid contract as at fair value through profit or loss in the cases set out in paragraph 4.3.5(a) and (b) because doing so would not reduce complexity or increase reliability.
Subsequent reassessment is prohibited unless there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that otherwise would be required under the contract, in which case reassessment is required.
An entity determines whether a modification to cash flows is significant by considering the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the embedded derivative, the host contract or both have changed and whether the change is significant relative to the previously expected cash flows on the contract.
Such changes are expected to be very infrequent. Such changes are determined by the entity's senior management as a result of external or internal changes and must be significant to the entity's operations and demonstrable to external parties.
Accordingly, a change in an entity's business model will occur only when an entity either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations; for example, when the entity has acquired, disposed of or terminated a business line.
Examples of a change in business model include the following
The entity acquires a company that manages commercial loans and has a business model that holds the loans in order to collect the contractual cash flows.
The portfolio of commercial loans is no longer for sale, and the portfolio is now managed together with the acquired commercial loans and all are held to collect the contractual cash flows.
That business no longer accepts new business and the financial services firm is actively marketing its mortgage loan portfolio for sale.
A change in the objective of the entity's business model must be effected before the reclassification date.
The following are not changes in business model
a change in intention related to particular financial assets (even in circumstances of significant changes in market conditions).
the temporary disappearance of a particular market for financial assets.
a transfer of financial assets between parts of the entity with different business models.
However, if part of the consideration given or received is for something other than the financial instrument, an entity shall measure the fair value of the financial instrument.
Any additional amount lent is an expense or a reduction of income unless it qualifies for recognition as some other type of asset.
If an entity determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price as mentioned in paragraph 5.1.1A, the entity shall account for that instrument at that date as follows
An entity shall recognise the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price as a gain or loss.
in all other cases, at the measurement required by paragraph 5.1.1, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price.
After initial recognition, the entity shall recognise that deferred difference as a gain or loss only to the extent that it arises from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability.
If the financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A, the transaction costs are amortised to profit or loss using the effective interest method.
The subsequent measurement of a financial asset or financial liability and the subsequent recognition of gains and losses described in paragraph B5.1.2A shall be consistent with the requirements of this Standard.
Investments in equity instruments and contracts on those investments
All investments in equity instruments and contracts on those instruments must be measured at fair value.
However, in limited circumstances, cost may be an appropriate estimate of fair value.
That may be the case if insufficient more recent information is available to measure fair value, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range.
Indicators that cost might not be representative of fair value include
a significant change in the performance of the investee compared with budgets, plans or milestones.
changes in expectation that the investee's technical product milestones will be achieved.
a significant change in the market for the investee's equity or its products or potential products.
a significant change in the global economy or the economic environment in which the investee operates.
a significant change in the performance of comparable entities, or in the valuations implied by the overall market.
internal matters of the investee such as fraud, commercial disputes, litigation, changes in management or strategy.
The list in paragraph B5.2.4 is not exhaustive.
An entity shall use all information about the performance and operations of the investee that becomes available after the date of initial recognition.
To the extent that any such relevant factors exist, they may indicate that cost might not be representative of fair value.
In such cases, the entity must measure fair value.
Cost is never the best estimate of fair value for investments in quoted equity instruments (or contracts on quoted equity instruments).
Amortised cost measurement (Section 5.4)
In applying the effective interest method, an entity identifies fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument.
The description of fees for financial services may not be indicative of the nature and substance of the services provided.
Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument are treated as an adjustment to the effective interest rate, unless the financial instrument is measured at fair value, with the change in fair value being recognised in profit or loss.
In those cases, the fees are recognised as revenue or expense when the instrument is initially recognised.
Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument include
origination fees received by the entity relating to the creation or acquisition of a financial asset.
Such fees may include compensation for activities such as evaluating the borrower's financial condition, evaluating and recording guarantees, collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating the terms of the instrument, preparing and processing documents and closing the transaction.
These fees are an integral part of generating an involvement with the resulting financial instrument.
commitment fees received by the entity to originate a loan when the loan commitment is not measured in accordance with paragraph 4.2.1(a) and it is probable that the entity will enter into a specific lending arrangement.
These fees are regarded as compensation for an ongoing involvement with the acquisition of a financial instrument.
If the commitment expires without the entity making the loan, the fee is recognised as revenue on expiry.
origination fees paid on issuing financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
These fees are an integral part of generating an involvement with a financial liability.
An entity distinguishes fees and costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate for the financial liability from origination fees and transaction costs relating to the right to provide services, such as investment management services.
fees charged for servicing a loan;
loan syndication fees received by an entity that arranges a loan and retains no part of the loan package for itself (or retains a part at the same effective interest rate for comparable risk as other participants).
When applying the effective interest method, an entity generally amortises any fees, points paid or received, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts that are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate over the expected life of the financial instrument.
However, a shorter period is used if this is the period to which the fees, points paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or discounts relate.
This will be the case when the variable to which the fees, points paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or discounts relate is repriced to market rates before the expected maturity of the financial instrument.
This is because the premium or discount relates to the period to the next interest reset date because, at that date, the variable to which the premium or discount relates (ie interest rates) is reset to the market rates.
If, however, the premium or discount results from a change in the credit spread over the floating rate specified in the financial instrument, or other variables that are not reset to the market rates, it is amortised over the expected life of the financial instrument.
For floating-rate financial assets and floating-rate financial liabilities, periodic re-estimation of cash flows to reflect the movements in the market rates of interest alters the effective interest rate.
If a floating-rate financial asset or a floating-rate financial liability is recognised initially at an amount equal to the principal receivable or payable on maturity, re-estimating the future interest payments normally has no significant effect on the carrying amount of the asset or the liability.
The entity recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or amortised cost of the financial liability as the present value of the estimated future contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial instrument's original effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets) or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.5.10.
The adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense.
In some cases a financial asset is considered credit-impaired at initial recognition because the credit risk is very high, and in the case of a purchase it is acquired at a deep discount.
An entity is required to include the initial expected credit losses in the estimated cash flows when calculating the credit-adjusted effective interest rate for financial assets that are considered to be purchased or originated credit-impaired at initial recognition.
However, this does not mean that a credit-adjusted effective interest rate should be applied solely because the financial asset has high credit risk at initial recognition.
Transaction costs include fees and commission paid to agents (including employees acting as selling agents), advisers, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and security exchanges, and transfer taxes and duties.
Transaction costs do not include debt premiums or discounts, financing costs or internal administrative or holding costs.
Write-offs can relate to a financial asset in its entirety or to a portion of it.
Collective and individual assessment basis
In order to meet the objective of recognising lifetime expected credit losses for significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition, it may be necessary to perform the assessment of significant increases in credit risk on a collective basis by considering information that is indicative of significant increases in credit risk on, for example, a group or sub-group of financial instruments.
This is to ensure that an entity meets the objective of recognising lifetime expected credit losses when there are significant increases in credit risk, even if evidence of such significant increases in credit risk at the individual instrument level is not yet available.
Lifetime expected credit losses are generally expected to be recognised before a financial instrument becomes past due.
Typically, credit risk increases significantly before a financial instrument becomes past due or other lagging borrower-specific factors (for example, a modification or restructuring) are observed.
Consequently when reasonable and supportable information that is more forward-looking than past due information is available without undue cost or effort, it must be used to assess changes in credit risk.
However, depending on the nature of the financial instruments and the credit risk information available for particular groups of financial instruments, an entity may not be able to identify significant changes in credit risk for individual financial instruments before the financial instrument becomes past due.
This may be the case for financial instruments such as retail loans for which there is little or no updated credit risk information that is routinely obtained and monitored on an individual instrument until a customer breaches the contractual terms.
If changes in the credit risk for individual financial instruments are not captured before they become past due, a loss allowance based only on credit information at an individual financial instrument level would not faithfully represent the changes in credit risk since initial recognition.
In some circumstances an entity does not have reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort to measure lifetime expected credit losses on an individual instrument basis.
In that case, lifetime expected credit losses shall be recognised on a collective basis that considers comprehensive credit risk information.
This comprehensive credit risk information must incorporate not only past due information but also all relevant credit information, including forward-looking macroeconomic information, in order to approximate the result of recognising lifetime expected credit losses when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition on an individual instrument level.
For the purpose of determining significant increases in credit risk and recognising a loss allowance on a collective basis, an entity can group financial instruments on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant increases in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis.
The entity should not obscure this information by grouping financial instruments with different risk characteristics.
Examples of shared credit risk characteristics may include, but are not limited to, the
geographical location of the borrower; and
the value of collateral relative to the financial asset if it has an impact on the probability of a default occurring (for example, non-recourse loans in some jurisdictions or loan-to-value ratios).
In order to meet this objective, if an entity is not able to group financial instruments for which the credit risk is considered to have increased significantly since initial recognition based on shared credit risk characteristics, the entity should recognise lifetime expected credit losses on a portion of the financial assets for which credit risk is deemed to have increased significantly.
The aggregation of financial instruments to assess whether there are changes in credit risk on a collective basis may change over time as new information becomes available on groups of, or individual, financial instruments.
Timing of recognising lifetime expected credit losses
The assessment of whether lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition (irrespective of whether a financial instrument has been repriced to reflect an increase in credit risk) instead of on evidence of a financial asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring.
Generally, there will be a significant increase in credit risk before a financial asset becomes credit-impaired or an actual default occurs.
For loan commitments, an entity considers changes in the risk of a default occurring on the loan to which a loan commitment relates.
For financial guarantee contracts, an entity considers the changes in the risk that the specified debtor will default on the contract.
The significance of a change in the credit risk since initial recognition depends on the risk of a default occurring as at initial recognition.
Thus, a given change, in absolute terms, in the risk of a default occurring will be more significant for a financial instrument with a lower initial risk of a default occurring compared to a financial instrument with a higher initial risk of a default occurring.
Because of the relationship between the expected life and the risk of a default occurring, the change in credit risk cannot be assessed simply by comparing the change in the absolute risk of a default occurring over time.
This is because the risk of a default occurring over the expected life usually decreases as time passes if the credit risk is unchanged and the financial instrument is closer to maturity.
However, for financial instruments that only have significant payment obligations close to the maturity of the financial instrument the risk of a default occurring may not necessarily decrease as time passes.
In such a case, an entity should also consider other qualitative factors that would demonstrate whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition.
An entity may apply various approaches when assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition or when measuring expected credit losses.
An entity may apply different approaches for different financial instruments.
An approach that does not include an explicit probability of default as an input per se, such as a credit loss rate approach, can be consistent with the requirements in this Standard, provided that an entity is able to separate the changes in the risk of a default occurring from changes in other drivers of expected credit losses, such as collateral, and considers the following when making the assessment
the change in the risk of a default occurring since initial recognition;
the expected life of the financial instrument; and
reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort that may affect credit risk.
The methods used to determine whether credit risk has increased significantly on a financial instrument since initial recognition should consider the characteristics of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments) and the default patterns in the past for comparable financial instruments.
When determining whether the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses is required, an entity shall consider reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort and that may affect the credit risk on a financial instrument in accordance with paragraph 5.5.17(c).
An entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information when determining whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition.
An entity shall consider reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort and that is relevant for the particular financial instrument being assessed.
However, some factors or indicators may not be identifiable on an individual financial instrument level.
The following non-exhaustive list of information may be relevant in assessing changes in credit risk
other changes in the rates or terms of an existing financial instrument that would be significantly different if the instrument was newly originated or issued at the reporting date (such as more stringent covenants, increased amounts of collateral or guarantees, or higher income coverage) because of changes in the credit risk of the financial instrument since initial recognition.
significant changes in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial instrument or similar financial instruments with the same expected life.
Changes in market indicators of credit risk include, but are not limited to
the credit default swap prices for the borrower;
(iii) the length of time or the extent to which the fair value of a financial asset has been less than its amortised cost; and
an actual or expected significant change in the financial instrument's external credit rating.
an actual or expected internal credit rating downgrade for the borrower or decrease in behavioural scoring used to assess credit risk internally.
Internal credit ratings and internal behavioural scoring are more reliable when they are mapped to external ratings or supported by default studies.
existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change in the borrower's ability to meet its debt obligations, such as an actual or expected increase in interest rates or an actual or expected significant increase in unemployment rates.
significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower.
an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the borrower that results in a significant change in the borrower's ability to meet its debt obligations, such as a decline in the demand for the borrower's sales product because of a shift in technology.
For example, if the value of collateral declines because house prices decline, borrowers in some jurisdictions have a greater incentive to default on their mortgages.
significant changes, such as reductions in financial support from a parent entity or other affiliate or an actual or expected significant change in the quality of credit enhancement, that are expected to reduce the borrower's economic incentive to make scheduled contractual payments.
Credit quality enhancements or support include the consideration of the financial condition of the guarantor and/or, for interests issued in securitisations, whether subordinated interests are expected to be capable of absorbing expected credit losses (for example, on the loans underlying the security).
changes in the entity's credit management approach in relation to the financial instrument; ie based on emerging indicators of changes in the credit risk of the financial instrument, the entity's credit risk management practice is expected to become more active or to be focused on managing the instrument, including the instrument becoming more closely monitored or controlled, or the entity specifically intervening with the borrower.
past due information, including the rebuttable presumption as set out in paragraph 5.5.11.
In some cases, the qualitative and non-statistical quantitative information available may be sufficient to determine that a financial instrument has met the criterion for the recognition of a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
That is, the information does not need to flow through a statistical model or credit ratings process in order to determine whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk of the financial instrument.
In other cases, an entity may need to consider other information, including information from its statistical models or credit ratings processes.
Alternatively, the entity may base the assessment on both types of information, ie qualitative factors that are not captured through the internal ratings process and a specific internal rating category at the reporting date, taking into consideration the credit risk characteristics at initial recognition, if both types of information are relevant.
The rebuttable presumption in paragraph 5.5.11 is not an absolute indicator that lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised, but is presumed to be the latest point at which lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised even when using forward-looking information (including macroeconomic factors on a portfolio level).
An entity can rebut this presumption.
An entity cannot align the timing of significant increases in credit risk and the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses to when a financial asset is regarded as credit-impaired or an entity's internal definition of default.
The credit risk on a financial instrument is considered low for the purposes of paragraph 5.5.10, if the financial instrument has a low risk of default, the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.
Financial instruments are not considered to have low credit risk when they are regarded as having a low risk of loss simply because of the value of collateral and the financial instrument without that collateral would not be considered low credit risk.
Financial instruments are also not considered to have low credit risk simply because they have a lower risk of default than the entity's other financial instruments or relative to the credit risk of the jurisdiction within which an entity operates.
To determine whether a financial instrument has low credit risk, an entity may use its internal credit risk ratings or other methodologies that are consistent with a globally understood definition of low credit risk and that consider the risks and the type of financial instruments that are being assessed.
An external rating of 'investment grade' is an example of a financial instrument that may be considered as having low credit risk.
However, financial instruments are not required to be externally rated to be considered to have low credit risk.
They should, however, be considered to have low credit risk from a market participant perspective taking into account all of the terms and conditions of the financial instrument.
Lifetime expected credit losses are not recognised on a financial instrument simply because it was considered to have low credit risk in the previous reporting period and is not considered to have low credit risk at the reporting date.
In such a case, an entity shall determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and thus whether lifetime expected credit losses are required to be recognised in accordance with paragraph 5.5.3.
In some circumstances, the renegotiation or modification of the contractual cash flows of a financial asset can lead to the derecognition of the existing financial asset in accordance with this Standard.
When the modification of a financial asset results in the derecognition of the existing financial asset and the subsequent recognition of the modified financial asset, the modified asset is considered a 'new' financial asset for the purposes of this Standard.
However, in some unusual circumstances following a modification that results in derecognition of the original financial asset, there may be evidence that the modified financial asset is credit-impaired at initial recognition, and thus, the financial asset should be recognised as an originated credit-impaired financial asset.
This might occur, for example, in a situation in which there was a substantial modification of a distressed asset that resulted in the derecognition of the original financial asset.
In such a case, it may be possible for the modification to result in a new financial asset which is credit- impaired at initial recognition.
If the contractual cash flows on a financial asset have been renegotiated or otherwise modified, but the financial asset is not derecognised, that financial asset is not automatically considered to have lower credit risk.
An entity shall assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition on the basis of all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort.
This includes historical and forward-looking information and an assessment of the credit risk over the expected life of the financial asset, which includes information about the circumstances that led to the modification.
Evidence that the criteria for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses are no longer met may include a history of up-to-date and timely payment performance against the modified contractual terms.
Typically a customer would need to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the credit risk is considered to have decreased.
Expected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (ie the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of the financial instrument.
A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.
Because expected credit losses consider the amount and timing of payments, a credit loss arises even if the entity expects to be paid in full but later than when contractually due.
For financial assets, a credit loss is the present value of the difference between
the contractual cash flows that are due to an entity under the contract; and
the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.
For undrawn loan commitments, a credit loss is the present value of the difference between
the contractual cash flows that are due to the entity if the holder of the loan commitment draws down the loan; and
the cash flows that the entity expects to receive if the loan is drawn down.
For a financial guarantee contract, the entity is required to make payments only in the event of a default by the debtor in accordance with the terms of the instrument that is guaranteed.
Accordingly, cash shortfalls are the expected payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs less any amounts that the entity expects to receive from the holder, the debtor or any other party.
If the asset is fully guaranteed, the estimation of cash shortfalls for a financial guarantee contract would be consistent with the estimations of cash shortfalls for the asset subject to the guarantee.
For a financial asset that is credit-impaired at the reporting date, but that is not a purchased or originated credit-impaired financial asset, an entity shall measure the expected credit losses as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as an impairment gain or loss.
An entity may use practical expedients when measuring expected credit losses if they are consistent with the principles in paragraph 5.5.17.
An example of a practical expedient is the calculation of the expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix.
Depending on the diversity of its customer base, the entity would use appropriate groupings if its historical credit loss experience shows significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments.
Examples of criteria that might be used to group assets include geographical region, product type, customer rating, collateral or trade credit insurance and type of customer (such as wholesale or retail).
When defining default for the purposes of determining the risk of a default occurring, an entity shall apply a default definition that is consistent with the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes for the relevant financial instrument and consider qualitative indicators (for example, financial covenants) when appropriate.
The definition of default used for these purposes shall be applied consistently to all financial instruments unless information becomes available that demonstrates that another default definition is more appropriate for a particular financial instrument.
In accordance with paragraph 5.5.19, the maximum period over which expected credit losses shall be measured is the maximum contractual period over which the entity is exposed to credit risk.
For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, this is the maximum contractual period over which an entity has a present contractual obligation to extend credit.
However, in accordance with paragraph 5.5.20, some financial instruments include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component and the entity's contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the entity's exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period.
However, in practice lenders continue to extend credit for a longer period and may only withdraw the facility after the credit risk of the borrower increases, which could be too late to prevent some or all of the expected credit losses.
These financial instruments generally have the following characteristics as a result of the nature of the financial instrument, the way in which the financial instruments are managed, and the nature of the available information about significant increases in credit risk
the financial instruments are managed on a collective basis.
When determining the period over which the entity is expected to be exposed to credit risk, but for which expected credit losses would not be mitigated by the entity's normal credit risk management actions, an entity should consider factors such as historical information and experience about
the period over which the entity was exposed to credit risk on similar financial instruments;
the length of time for related defaults to occur on similar financial instruments following a significant increase in credit risk; and
the credit risk management actions that an entity expects to take once the credit risk on the financial instrument has increased, such as the reduction or removal of undrawn limits.
The purpose of estimating expected credit losses is neither to estimate a worst-case scenario nor to estimate the best-case scenario.
Instead, an estimate of expected credit losses shall always reflect the possibility that a credit loss occurs and the possibility that no credit loss occurs even if the most likely outcome is no credit loss.
Paragraph 5.5.17(a) requires the estimate of expected credit losses to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes.
In practice, this may not need to be a complex analysis.
In some cases, relatively simple modelling may be sufficient, without the need for a large number of detailed simulations of scenarios.
For example, the average credit losses of a large group of financial instruments with shared risk characteristics may be a reasonable estimate of the probability-weighted amount.
In other situations, the identification of scenarios that specify the amount and timing of the cash flows for particular outcomes and the estimated probability of those outcomes will probably be needed.
For lifetime expected credit losses, an entity shall estimate the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument during its expected life.
Expected credit losses shall be discounted to the reporting date, not to the expected default or some other date, using the effective interest rate determined at initial recognition or an approximation thereof.
For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, expected credit losses shall be discounted using the credit-adjusted effective interest rate determined at initial recognition.
The expected credit losses on a loan commitment shall be discounted using the effective interest rate, or an approximation thereof, that will be applied when recognising the financial asset resulting from the loan commitment.
This is because for the purpose of applying the impairment requirements, a financial asset that is recognised following a draw down on a loan commitment shall be treated as a continuation of that commitment instead of as a new financial instrument.
The expected credit losses on the financial asset shall therefore be measured considering the initial credit risk of the loan commitment from the date that the entity became a party to the irrevocable commitment.
Expected credit losses on financial guarantee contracts or on loan commitments for which the effective interest rate cannot be determined shall be discounted by applying a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks that are specific to the cash flows but only if, and to the extent that, the risks are taken into account by adjusting the discount rate instead of adjusting the cash shortfalls being discounted.
For the purpose of this Standard, reasonable and supportable information is that which is reasonably available at the reporting date without undue cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
Information that is available for financial reporting purposes is considered to be available without undue cost or effort.
An entity is not required to incorporate forecasts of future conditions over the entire expected life of a financial instrument.
The degree of judgement that is required to estimate expected credit losses depends on the availability of detailed information.
As the forecast horizon increases, the availability of detailed information decreases and the degree of judgement required to estimate expected credit losses increases.
An entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information but shall consider all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort and that is relevant to the estimate of expected credit losses, including the effect of expected prepayments.
The information used shall include factors that are specific to the borrower, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date.
Possible data sources include internal historical credit loss experience, internal ratings, credit loss experience of other entities and external ratings, reports and statistics.
Entities that have no, or insufficient, sources of entity-specific data may use peer group experience for the comparable financial instrument (or groups of financial instruments).
Historical information is an important anchor or base from which to measure expected credit losses.
However, an entity shall adjust historical data, such as credit loss experience, on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of the current conditions and its forecasts of future conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical data is based, and to remove the effects of the conditions in the historical period that are not relevant to the future contractual cash flows.
Estimates of changes in expected credit losses should reflect, and be directionally consistent with, changes in related observable data from period to period (such as changes in unemployment rates, property prices, commodity prices, payment status or other factors that are indicative of credit losses on the financial instrument or in the group of financial instruments and in the magnitude of those changes).
An entity shall regularly review the methodology and assumptions used for estimating expected credit losses to reduce any differences between estimates and actual credit loss experience.
When using historical credit loss experience in estimating expected credit losses, it is important that information about historical credit loss rates is applied to groups that are defined in a manner that is consistent with the groups for which the historical credit loss rates were observed.
Consequently, the method used shall enable each group of financial assets to be associated with information about past credit loss experience in groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics and with relevant observable data that reflects current conditions.
Expected credit losses reflect an entity's own expectations of credit losses.
However, when considering all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort in estimating expected credit losses, an entity should also consider observable market information about the credit risk of the particular financial instrument or similar financial instruments.
For the purposes of measuring expected credit losses, the estimate of expected cash shortfalls shall reflect the cash flows expected from collateral and other credit enhancements that are part of the contractual terms and are not recognised separately by the entity.
Consequently, any cash flows that are expected from the realisation of the collateral beyond the contractual maturity of the contract should be included in this analysis.
Any collateral obtained as a result of foreclosure is not recognised as an asset that is separate from the collateralised financial instrument unless it meets the relevant recognition criteria for an asset in this or other Standards.
Reclassification of financial assets (Section 5.6)
Both the amortised cost measurement category and the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category require that the effective interest rate is determined at initial recognition.
Both of those measurement categories also require that the impairment requirements are applied in the same way.
Consequently, when an entity reclassifies a financial asset between the amortised cost measurement category and the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category
the recognition of interest revenue will not change and therefore the entity continues to use the same effective interest rate.
the measurement of expected credit losses will not change because both measurement categories apply the same impairment approach.
However if a financial asset is reclassified out of the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category and into the amortised cost measurement category, a loss allowance would be recognised as an adjustment to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset from the reclassification date.
However, an entity is not required to separately recognise interest revenue or impairment gains or losses for a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Consequently, when an entity reclassifies a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss measurement category, the effective interest rate is determined on the basis of the fair value of the asset at the reclassification date.
Gains and losses (Section 5.7)
This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument (ie share-by-share) basis.
This measurement category recognises information in profit or loss as if the financial asset is measured at amortised cost, while the financial asset is measured in the statement of financial position at fair value.
Gains or losses, other than those that are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with paragraphs 5.7.10–5.7.11, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
When these financial assets are derecognised, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
This reflects the gain or loss that would have been recognised in profit or loss upon derecognition if the financial asset had been measured at amortised cost.
For the purpose of recognising foreign exchange gains and losses under IAS 21, a financial asset measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A is treated as a monetary item.
Accordingly, such a financial asset is treated as an asset measured at amortised cost in the foreign currency.
Exchange differences on the amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss and other changes in the carrying amount are recognised in accordance with paragraph 5.7.10.
Such an investment is not a monetary item.
If there is a hedging relationship between a non-derivative monetary asset and a non-derivative monetary liability, changes in the foreign currency component of those financial instruments are presented in profit or loss.
When an entity designates a financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss, it must determine whether presenting in other comprehensive income the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.
An accounting mismatch would be created or enlarged if presenting the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income would result in a greater mismatch in profit or loss than if those amounts were presented in profit or loss.
To make that determination, an entity must assess whether it expects that the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk will be offset in profit or loss by a change in the fair value of another financial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Such an expectation must be based on an economic relationship between the characteristics of the liability and the characteristics of the other financial instrument.
That determination is made at initial recognition and is not reassessed.
For practical purposes the entity need not enter into all of the assets and liabilities giving rise to an accounting mismatch at exactly the same time.
A reasonable delay is permitted provided that any remaining transactions are expected to occur.
An entity must apply consistently its methodology for determining whether presenting in other comprehensive income the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.
However, an entity may use different methodologies when there are different economic relationships between the characteristics of the liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss and the characteristics of the other financial instruments.
If such a mismatch would be created or enlarged, the entity is required to present all changes in fair value (including the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability) in profit or loss.
If such a mismatch would not be created or enlarged, the entity is required to present the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income.
The following example describes a situation in which an accounting mismatch would be created in profit or loss if the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability were presented in other comprehensive income.
A mortgage bank provides loans to customers and funds those loans by selling bonds with matching characteristics (eg amount outstanding, repayment profile, term and currency) in the market.
The contractual terms of the loan permit the mortgage customer to prepay its loan (ie satisfy its obligation to the bank) by buying the corresponding bond at fair value in the market and delivering that bond to the mortgage bank.
As a result of that contractual prepayment right, if the credit quality of the bond worsens (and, thus, the fair value of the mortgage bank's liability decreases), the fair value of the mortgage bank's loan asset also decreases.
The change in the fair value of the asset reflects the mortgage customer's contractual right to prepay the mortgage loan by buying the underlying bond at fair value (which, in this example, has decreased) and delivering the bond to the mortgage bank.
Consequently, the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability (the bond) will be offset in profit or loss by a corresponding change in the fair value of a financial asset (the loan).
If the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk were presented in other comprehensive income there would be an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.
Consequently, the mortgage bank is required to present all changes in fair value of the liability (including the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk) in profit or loss.
In the example in paragraph B5.7.10, there is a contractual linkage between the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability and changes in the fair value of the financial asset (ie as a result of the mortgage customer's contractual right to prepay the loan by buying the bond at fair value and delivering the bond to the mortgage bank).
However, an accounting mismatch may also occur in the absence of a contractual linkage.
An accounting mismatch in profit or loss would arise only when the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk (as defined in IFRS 7) are expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of another financial instrument.
For the purposes of applying the requirement in paragraph 5.7.7(a), credit risk is different from asset-specific performance risk.
The effect of the performance of the assets on the fair value of the liability is asset-specific performance risk, not credit risk.
Determining the effects of changes in credit risk
For the purposes of applying the requirement in paragraph 5.7.7(a), an entity shall determine the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability either
using an alternative method the entity believes more faithfully represents the amount of change in the liability's fair value that is attributable to changes in its credit risk.
Changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk include changes in a benchmark interest rate, the price of another entity's financial instrument, a commodity price, a foreign exchange rate or an index of prices or rates.
If the only significant relevant changes in market conditions for a liability are changes in an observed (benchmark) interest rate, the amount in paragraph B5.7.16(a) can be estimated as follows
It deducts from this rate of return the observed (benchmark) interest rate at the start of the period, to arrive at an instrument-specific component of the internal rate of return.
This is the amount to be presented in other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.7(a).
The example in paragraph B5.7.18 assumes that changes in fair value arising from factors other than changes in the instrument's credit risk or changes in observed (benchmark) interest rates are not significant.
This method would not be appropriate if changes in fair value arising from other factors are significant.
In those cases, an entity is required to use an alternative method that more faithfully measures the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk (see paragraph B5.7.16(b)).
For example, if the instrument in the example contains an embedded derivative, the change in fair value of the embedded derivative is excluded in determining the amount to be presented in other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.7(a).
As with all fair value measurements, an entity's measurement method for determining the portion of the change in the liability's fair value that is attributable to changes in its credit risk must make maximum use of relevant observable inputs and minimum use of unobservable inputs.
Derivatives that are embedded in hybrid contracts, but that are not separately accounted for, cannot be designated as separate hedging instruments.
This Standard does not restrict the circumstances in which a derivative that is measured at fair value through profit or loss may be designated as a hedging instrument, except for some written options.
A written option does not qualify as a hedging instrument unless it is designated as an offset to a purchased option, including one that is embedded in another financial instrument (for example, a written call option used to hedge a callable liability).
Those hedged items can be in different hedging relationships.
A firm commitment to acquire a business in a business combination cannot be a hedged item, except for foreign currency risk, because the other risks being hedged cannot be specifically identified and measured.
Those other risks are general business risks.
In that case, the entity may designate the hedged item on the basis of the aggregated exposure.
When designating the hedged item on the basis of the aggregated exposure, an entity considers the combined effect of the items that constitute the aggregated exposure for the purpose of assessing hedge effectiveness and measuring hedge ineffectiveness.
However, the items that constitute the aggregated exposure remain accounted for separately.
This means that, for example
derivatives that are part of an aggregated exposure are recognised as separate assets or liabilities measured at fair value; and
if a hedging relationship is designated between the items that constitute the aggregated exposure, the way in which a derivative is included as part of an aggregated exposure must be consistent with the designation of that derivative as the hedging instrument at the level of the aggregated exposure.
For example, if an entity excludes the forward element of a derivative from its designation as the hedging instrument for the hedging relationship between the items that constitute the aggregated exposure, it must also exclude the forward element when including that derivative as a hedged item as part of the aggregated exposure.
Otherwise, the aggregated exposure shall include a derivative, either in its entirety or a proportion of it.
For this purpose an entity can be a parent, subsidiary, associate, joint arrangement or branch.
This is usually the case for royalty payments, interest payments or management charges between members of the same group, unless there is a related external transaction.
If a hedge of a forecast intragroup transaction qualifies for hedge accounting, any gain or loss is recognised in, and taken out of, other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 6.5.11.
The relevant period or periods during which the foreign currency risk of the hedged transaction affects profit or loss is when it affects consolidated profit or loss.
A component is a hedged item that is less than the entire item.
Consequently, a component reflects only some of the risks of the item of which it is a part or reflects the risks only to some extent (for example, when designating a proportion of an item).
To be eligible for designation as a hedged item, a risk component must be a separately identifiable component of the financial or the non-financial item, and the changes in the cash flows or the fair value of the item attributable to changes in that risk component must be reliably measurable.
When identifying what risk components qualify for designation as a hedged item, an entity assesses such risk components within the context of the particular market structure to which the risk or risks relate and in which the hedging activity takes place.
Such a determination requires an evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, which differ by risk and market.
When designating risk components as hedged items, an entity considers whether the risk components are explicitly specified in a contract (contractually specified risk components) or whether they are implicit in the fair value or the cash flows of an item of which they are a part (non-contractually specified risk components).
Entity A hedges the gas oil component in that supply contract using a gas oil forward contract.
Because the gas oil component is specified by the terms and conditions of the supply contract it is a contractually specified risk component.
Hence, because of the pricing formula, Entity A concludes that the gas oil price exposure is separately identifiable.
At the same time, there is a market for gas oil forward contracts.
Hence, Entity A concludes that the gas oil price exposure is reliably measurable.
Consequently, the gas oil price exposure in the supply contract is a risk component that is eligible for designation as a hedged item.
Entity B increases the hedged volume over time (as the delivery date approaches).
exchange-traded coffee futures contracts; and
coffee supply contracts for Arabica coffee from Colombia delivered to a specific manufacturing site.
These contracts price a tonne of coffee based on the exchange-traded coffee futures contract price plus a fixed price differential plus a variable logistics services charge using a pricing formula.
The coffee supply contract is an executory contract in accordance with which Entity B takes actual delivery of coffee.
For deliveries that relate to the current harvest, entering into the coffee supply contracts allows Entity B to fix the price differential between the actual coffee quality purchased (Arabica coffee from Colombia) and the benchmark quality that is the underlying of the exchange-traded futures contract.
However, for deliveries that relate to the next harvest, the coffee supply contracts are not yet available, so the price differential cannot be fixed.
Entity B uses exchange-traded coffee futures contracts to hedge the benchmark quality component of its coffee price risk for deliveries that relate to the current harvest as well as the next harvest.
For deliveries related to the current harvest, after Entity B enters into a coffee supply contract, the coffee price risk reflecting the benchmark quality is a contractually specified risk component because the pricing formula includes an indexation to the exchange-traded coffee futures contract price.
Entity B concludes that this risk component is separately identifiable and reliably measurable.
For deliveries related to the next harvest, Entity B has not yet entered into any coffee supply contracts (ie those deliveries are forecast transactions).
Hence, the coffee price risk reflecting the benchmark quality is a non-contractually specified risk component.
Hence, on the basis of this analysis of the market structure, Entity B concludes that the forecast transactions also involve the coffee price risk that reflects the benchmark quality as a risk component that is separately identifiable and reliably measurable even though it is not contractually specified.
Consequently, Entity B may designate hedging relationships on a risk components basis (for the coffee price risk that reflects the benchmark quality) for coffee supply contracts as well as forecast transactions.
Crude oil is a raw material benchmark that affects the price of various refined oil products as their most basic input.
Gas oil is a benchmark for refined oil products, which is used as a pricing reference for oil distillates more generally.
This is also reflected in the types of derivative financial instruments for the crude oil and refined oil products markets of the environment in which Entity C operates, such as
the benchmark crude oil futures contract, which is for Brent crude oil;
Hence, Entity C concludes that the price risk of its jet fuel purchases includes a crude oil price risk component based on Brent crude oil and a gas oil price risk component, even though crude oil and gas oil are not specified in any contractual arrangement.
Consequently, Entity C may designate hedging relationships for forecast jet fuel purchases on a risk components basis (for crude oil or gas oil).
This analysis also means that if, for example, Entity C used crude oil derivatives based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, changes in the price differential between Brent crude oil and WTI crude oil would cause hedge ineffectiveness.
This instrument is issued in an environment with a market in which a large variety of similar debt instruments are compared by their spreads to a benchmark rate (for example, LIBOR) and variable-rate instruments in that environment are typically indexed to that benchmark rate.
Entity D concludes that the benchmark rate is a component that can be separately identified and reliably measured.
Consequently, Entity D may designate hedging relationships for the fixed-rate debt instrument on a risk component basis for the benchmark interest rate risk.
When designating a risk component as a hedged item, the hedge accounting requirements apply to that risk component in the same way as they apply to other hedged items that are not risk components.
For example, the qualifying criteria apply, including that the hedging relationship must meet the hedge effectiveness requirements, and any hedge ineffectiveness must be measured and recognised.
In such a situation, the entity designates only cash flow losses that result from an increase in the price above the specified level.
The hedged risk does not include the time value of a purchased option, because the time value is not a component of the forecast transaction that affects profit or loss.
There is a rebuttable presumption that unless inflation risk is contractually specified, it is not separately identifiable and reliably measurable and hence cannot be designated as a risk component of a financial instrument.
However, in limited cases, it is possible to identify a risk component for inflation risk that is separately identifiable and reliably measurable because of the particular circumstances of the inflation environment and the relevant debt market.
This means that for the respective currency, inflation is a relevant factor that is separately considered by the debt markets.
Conversely, in many cases an inflation risk component is not separately identifiable and reliably measurable.
In this case the analysis of the market structure and of the facts and circumstances does not support the entity concluding that inflation is a relevant factor that is separately considered by the debt markets.
Hence, the entity cannot overcome the rebuttable presumption that inflation risk that is not contractually specified is not separately identifiable and reliably measurable.
Consequently, an inflation risk component would not be eligible for designation as the hedged item.
This applies irrespective of any inflation hedging instrument that the entity has actually entered into.
In particular, the entity cannot simply impute the terms and conditions of the actual inflation hedging instrument by projecting its terms and conditions onto the nominal interest rate debt.
A contractually specified inflation risk component of the cash flows of a recognised inflation-linked bond (assuming that there is no requirement to account for an embedded derivative separately) is separately identifiable and reliably measurable, as long as other cash flows of the instrument are not affected by the inflation risk component.
The type of component changes the accounting outcome.
An entity shall designate the component for accounting purposes consistently with its risk management objective.
A layer component may be specified from a defined, but open, population, or from a defined nominal amount.
If a layer component is designated in a fair value hedge, an entity shall specify it from a defined nominal amount.
For a layer component in a fair value hedge, this requires an entity to track the nominal amount from which it is defined.
A layer component that includes a prepayment option is not eligible to be designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge if the prepayment option's fair value is affected by changes in the hedged risk, unless the designated layer includes the effect of the related prepayment option when determining the change in the fair value of the hedged item.
If a component of the cash flows of a financial or a non-financial item is designated as the hedged item, that component must be less than or equal to the total cash flows of the entire item.
For example, in the case of a financial liability whose effective interest rate is below LIBOR, an entity cannot designate
a component of the liability equal to interest at LIBOR (plus the principal amount in case of a fair value hedge); and
If a fixed-rate financial instrument is hedged some time after its origination and interest rates have changed in the meantime, the entity can designate a risk component equal to a benchmark rate that is higher than the contractual rate paid on the item.
A similar example of a non-financial item is a specific type of crude oil from a particular oil field that is priced off the relevant benchmark crude oil.
However, the entity cannot designate a component that is equal to the full change in the benchmark crude oil price.
Qualifying criteria for hedge accounting (Section 6.4)
Hedge effectiveness is the extent to which changes in the fair value or the cash flows of the hedging instrument offset changes in the fair value or the cash flows of the hedged item (for example, when the hedged item is a risk component, the relevant change in fair value or cash flows of an item is the one that is attributable to the hedged risk).
Hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the changes in the fair value or the cash flows of the hedging instrument are greater or less than those on the hedged item.
When designating a hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, an entity shall analyse the sources of hedge ineffectiveness that are expected to affect the hedging relationship during its term.
This analysis (including any updates in accordance with paragraph B6.5.21 arising from rebalancing a hedging relationship) is the basis for the entity's assessment of meeting the hedge effectiveness requirements.
Economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument
The requirement that an economic relationship exists means that the hedging instrument and the hedged item have values that generally move in the opposite direction because of the same risk, which is the hedged risk.
Hence, there must be an expectation that the value of the hedging instrument and the value of the hedged item will systematically change in response to movements in either the same underlying or underlyings that are economically related in such a way that they respond in a similar way to the risk that is being hedged (for example, Brent and WTI crude oil).
That is still consistent with an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item if the values of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are still expected to typically move in the opposite direction when the underlyings move.
The assessment of whether an economic relationship exists includes an analysis of the possible behaviour of the hedging relationship during its term to ascertain whether it can be expected to meet the risk management objective.
The effect of credit risk
Because the hedge accounting model is based on a general notion of offset between gains and losses on the hedging instrument and the hedged item, hedge effectiveness is determined not only by the economic relationship between those items (ie the changes in their underlyings) but also by the effect of credit risk on the value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
The effect of credit risk means that even if there is an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the level of offset might become erratic.
This can result from a change in the credit risk of either the hedging instrument or the hedged item that is of such a magnitude that the credit risk dominates the value changes that result from the economic relationship (ie the effect of the changes in the underlyings).
A level of magnitude that gives rise to dominance is one that would result in the loss (or gain) from credit risk frustrating the effect of changes in the underlyings on the value of the hedging instrument or the hedged item, even if those changes were significant.
Conversely, if during a particular period there is little change in the underlyings, the fact that even small credit risk-related changes in the value of the hedging instrument or the hedged item might affect the value more than the underlyings does not create dominance.
An example of credit risk dominating a hedging relationship is when an entity hedges an exposure to commodity price risk using an uncollateralised derivative.
If the counterparty to that derivative experiences a severe deterioration in its credit standing, the effect of the changes in the counterparty's credit standing might outweigh the effect of changes in the commodity price on the fair value of the hedging instrument, whereas changes in the value of the hedged item depend largely on the commodity price changes.
In accordance with the hedge effectiveness requirements, the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship must be the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.
However, the designation of the hedging relationship using the same hedge ratio as that resulting from the quantities of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses shall not reflect an imbalance between the weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that would in turn create hedge ineffectiveness (irrespective of whether recognised or not) that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting.
Hence, for the purpose of designating a hedging relationship, an entity must adjust the hedge ratio that results from the quantities of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses if that is needed to avoid such an imbalance.
Examples of relevant considerations in assessing whether an accounting outcome is inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting are
whether the intended hedge ratio is established to avoid recognising hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges, or to achieve fair value hedge adjustments for more hedged items with the aim of increasing the use of fair value accounting, but without offsetting fair value changes of the hedging instrument; and
In that case, the entity designates the hedging relationship using the hedge ratio that results from the number of coffee futures contracts that it actually uses, because the hedge ineffectiveness resulting from the mismatch in the weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument would not result in an accounting outcome that is inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting.
An entity shall assess at the inception of the hedging relationship, and on an ongoing basis, whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.
The assessment relates to expectations about hedge effectiveness and is therefore only forward-looking.
Methods for assessing whether the hedge effectiveness requirements are met
This Standard does not specify a method for assessing whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.
However, an entity shall use a method that captures the relevant characteristics of the hedging relationship including the sources of hedge ineffectiveness.
Depending on those factors, the method can be a qualitative or a quantitative assessment.
For example, when the critical terms (such as the nominal amount, maturity and underlying) of the hedging instrument and the hedged item match or are closely aligned, it might be possible for an entity to conclude on the basis of a qualitative assessment of those critical terms that the hedging instrument and the hedged item have values that will generally move in the opposite direction because of the same risk and hence that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging instrument (see paragraphs B6.4.4–B6.4.6).
The fact that a derivative is in or out of the money when it is designated as a hedging instrument does not in itself mean that a qualitative assessment is inappropriate.
It depends on the circumstances whether hedge ineffectiveness arising from that fact could have a magnitude that a qualitative assessment would not adequately capture.
Conversely, if the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not closely aligned, there is an increased level of uncertainty about the extent of offset.
Consequently, the hedge effectiveness during the term of the hedging relationship is more difficult to predict.
In such a situation it might only be possible for an entity to conclude on the basis of a quantitative assessment that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging instrument (see paragraphs B6.4.4–B6.4.6).
In some situations a quantitative assessment might also be needed to assess whether the hedge ratio used for designating the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (see paragraphs B6.4.9–B6.4.11).
If there are changes in circumstances that affect hedge effectiveness, an entity may have to change the method for assessing whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements in order to ensure that the relevant characteristics of the hedging relationship, including the sources of hedge ineffectiveness, are still captured.
An entity's risk management is the main source of information to perform the assessment of whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.
This means that the management information (or analysis) used for decision-making purposes can be used as a basis for assessing whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.
An entity's documentation of the hedging relationship includes how it will assess the hedge effectiveness requirements, including the method or methods used.
Accounting for qualifying hedging relationships (Section 6.5)
An example of a fair value hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of a fixed-rate debt instrument arising from changes in interest rates.
The purpose of a cash flow hedge is to defer the gain or loss on the hedging instrument to a period or periods in which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.
An example of a cash flow hedge is the use of a swap to change floating rate debt (whether measured at amortised cost or fair value) to fixed-rate debt (ie a hedge of a future transaction in which the future cash flows being hedged are the future interest payments).
Conversely, a forecast purchase of an equity instrument that, once acquired, will be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, is an example of an item that cannot be the hedged item in a cash flow hedge, because any gain or loss on the hedging instrument that would be deferred could not be appropriately reclassified to profit or loss during a period in which it would achieve offset.
For the same reason, a forecast purchase of an equity instrument that, once acquired, will be accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value presented in other comprehensive income also cannot be the hedged item in a cash flow hedge.
When measuring hedge ineffectiveness, an entity shall consider the time value of money.
Consequently, the entity determines the value of the hedged item on a present value basis and therefore the change in the value of the hedged item also includes the effect of the time value of money.
The hypothetical derivative replicates the hedged item and hence results in the same outcome as if that change in value was determined by a different approach.
Hence, using a 'hypothetical derivative' is not a method in its own right but a mathematical expedient that can only be used to calculate the value of the hedged item.
Consequently, a 'hypothetical derivative' cannot be used to include features in the value of the hedged item that only exist in the hedging instrument (but not in the hedged item).
An example is debt denominated in a foreign currency (irrespective of whether it is fixed-rate or variable-rate debt).
When using a hypothetical derivative to calculate the change in the value of such debt or the present value of the cumulative change in its cash flows, the hypothetical derivative cannot simply impute a charge for exchanging different currencies even though actual derivatives under which different currencies are exchanged might include such a charge (for example, cross-currency interest rate swaps).
The change in the value of the hedged item determined using a hypothetical derivative may also be used for the purpose of assessing whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.
Rebalancing the hedging relationship and changes to the hedge ratio
Rebalancing refers to the adjustments made to the designated quantities of the hedged item or the hedging instrument of an already existing hedging relationship for the purpose of maintaining a hedge ratio that complies with the hedge effectiveness requirements.
Changes to designated quantities of a hedged item or of a hedging instrument for a different purpose do not constitute rebalancing for the purpose of this Standard.
Rebalancing is accounted for as a continuation of the hedging relationship in accordance with paragraphs B6.5.9–B6.5.21.
On rebalancing, the hedge ineffectiveness of the hedging relationship is determined and recognised immediately before adjusting the hedging relationship.
Adjusting the hedge ratio allows an entity to respond to changes in the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item that arise from their underlyings or risk variables.
Hence, rebalancing allows the continuation of a hedging relationship in situations in which the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item changes in a way that can be compensated for by adjusting the hedge ratio.
If the exchange rate between Foreign Currency A and Foreign Currency B were changed (ie a new band or rate was set), rebalancing the hedging relationship to reflect the new exchange rate would ensure that the hedging relationship would continue to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement for the hedge ratio in the new circumstances.
In contrast, if there was a default on the currency derivative, changing the hedge ratio could not ensure that the hedging relationship would continue to meet that hedge effectiveness requirement.
Hence, rebalancing does not facilitate the continuation of a hedging relationship in situations in which the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item changes in a way that cannot be compensated for by adjusting the hedge ratio.
Not every change in the extent of offset between the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item's fair value or cash flows constitutes a change in the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
an indication that the hedge ratio no longer appropriately reflects the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
Hence, this evaluation requires judgement.
Fluctuation around a constant hedge ratio (and hence the related hedge ineffectiveness) cannot be reduced by adjusting the hedge ratio in response to each particular outcome.
Hence, in such circumstances, the change in the extent of offset is a matter of measuring and recognising hedge ineffectiveness but does not require rebalancing.
Hence, in such circumstances, an entity must evaluate whether the hedging relationship reflects an imbalance between the weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that would create hedge ineffectiveness (irrespective of whether recognised or not) that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting.
If the hedge ratio is adjusted, it also affects the measurement and recognition of hedge ineffectiveness because, on rebalancing, the hedge ineffectiveness of the hedging relationship must be determined and recognised immediately before adjusting the hedging relationship in accordance with paragraph B6.5.8.
Typically, that adjustment should reflect adjustments in the quantities of the hedging instrument and the hedged item that it actually uses.
However, an entity must adjust the hedge ratio that results from the quantities of the hedged item or the hedging instrument that it actually uses if
the hedge ratio that results from changes to the quantities of the hedging instrument or the hedged item that the entity actually uses would reflect an imbalance that would create hedge ineffectiveness that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting; or
an entity would retain quantities of the hedging instrument and the hedged item that it actually uses, resulting in a hedge ratio that, in new circumstances, would reflect an imbalance that would create hedge ineffectiveness that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting (ie an entity must not create an imbalance by omitting to adjust the hedge ratio).
Rebalancing does not apply if the risk management objective for a hedging relationship has changed.
Instead, hedge accounting for that hedging relationship shall be discontinued (despite that an entity might designate a new hedging relationship that involves the hedging instrument or hedged item of the previous hedging relationship as described in paragraph B6.5.28).
If a hedging relationship is rebalanced, the adjustment to the hedge ratio can be effected in different ways
the weighting of the hedged item can be increased (which at the same time reduces the weighting of the hedging instrument) by
increasing the volume of the hedged item; or
decreasing the volume of the hedging instrument.
the weighting of the hedging instrument can be increased (which at the same time reduces the weighting of the hedged item) by
increasing the volume of the hedging instrument; or
decreasing the volume of the hedged item.
Changes in volume refer to the quantities that are part of the hedging relationship.
For example, decreasing the volume of the hedging instrument can result in the entity retaining a derivative, but only part of it might remain a hedging instrument of the hedging relationship.
This could occur if the rebalancing could be effected only by reducing the volume of the hedging instrument in the hedging relationship, but with the entity retaining the volume that is no longer needed.
In that case, the undesignated part of the derivative would be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss (unless it was designated as a hedging instrument in a different hedging relationship).
Adjusting the hedge ratio by increasing the volume of the hedged item does not affect how the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are measured.
The measurement of the changes in the value of the hedged item related to the previously designated volume also remains unaffected.
However, from the date of rebalancing, the changes in the value of the hedged item also include the change in the value of the additional volume of the hedged item.
These changes are measured starting from, and by reference to, the date of rebalancing instead of the date on which the hedging relationship was designated.
Adjusting the hedge ratio by decreasing the volume of the hedging instrument does not affect how the changes in the value of the hedged item are measured.
The measurement of the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument related to the volume that continues to be designated also remains unaffected.
However, from the date of rebalancing, the volume by which the hedging instrument was decreased is no longer part of the hedging relationship.

The documentation of the hedging relationship shall be updated accordingly.
Discontinuation of hedge accounting applies prospectively from the date on which the qualifying criteria are no longer met.
still meets the risk management objective on the basis of which it qualified for hedge accounting (ie the entity still pursues that risk management objective); and
continues to meet all other qualifying criteria (after taking into account any rebalancing of the hedging relationship, if applicable).
For the purposes of this Standard, an entity's risk management strategy is distinguished from its risk management objectives.
The risk management strategy is established at the highest level at which an entity determines how it manages its risk.
Risk management strategies typically identify the risks to which the entity is exposed and set out how the entity responds to them.
A risk management strategy is typically in place for a longer period and may include some flexibility to react to changes in circumstances that occur while that strategy is in place (for example, different interest rate or commodity price levels that result in a different extent of hedging).
This is normally set out in a general document that is cascaded down through an entity through policies containing more specific guidelines.
In contrast, the risk management objective for a hedging relationship applies at the level of a particular hedging relationship.
It relates to how the particular hedging instrument that has been designated is used to hedge the particular exposure that has been designated as the hedged item.
Hence, a risk management strategy can involve many different hedging relationships whose risk management objectives relate to executing that overall risk management strategy.
If interest rates are low the entity fixes the interest for more debt than when interest rates are high.
In this situation the risk management strategy itself remains unchanged.
The addition of new debt instruments and the derecognition of debt instruments continuously change that exposure (ie it is different from simply running off a position that matures).
This is a dynamic process in which both the exposure and the hedging instruments used to manage it do not remain the same for long.
Consequently, an entity with such an exposure frequently adjusts the hedging instruments used to manage the interest rate risk as the exposure changes.
After a short period of time, the entity discontinues all, some or a part of the previously designated hedging relationships for maturity periods and designates new hedging relationships for maturity periods on the basis of their size and the hedging instruments that exist at that time.
The discontinuation of hedge accounting in this situation reflects that those hedging relationships are established in such a way that the entity looks at a new hedging instrument and a new hedged item instead of the hedging instrument and the hedged item that were designated previously.
The risk management strategy remains the same, but there is no risk management objective that continues for those previously designated hedging relationships, which as such no longer exist.
In such a situation, the discontinuation of hedge accounting applies to the extent to which the risk management objective has changed.
Within that strategy the entity manages the foreign currency risk as a particular hedging relationship only up to the point of the recognition of the receivable.
For accounting purposes, this works as a 'natural' hedge because the gains and losses from the foreign currency risk on all of those items are immediately recognised in profit or loss.
Consequently, for accounting purposes, if the hedging relationship is designated for the period up to the payment date, it must be discontinued when the receivable is recognised, because the risk management objective of the original hedging relationship no longer applies.
The foreign currency risk is now managed within the same strategy but on a different basis.
The discontinuation of hedge accounting can affect
a hedging relationship in its entirety; or
a part of a hedging relationship (which means that hedge accounting continues for the remainder of the hedging relationship).
A hedging relationship is discontinued in its entirety when, as a whole, it ceases to meet the qualifying criteria.
the hedging instrument or instruments have been sold or terminated (in relation to the entire volume that was part of the hedging relationship); or
there is no longer an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument or the effect of credit risk starts to dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship.
when the occurrence of some of the volume of the hedged item that is (or is a component of) a forecast transaction is no longer highly probable, hedge accounting is discontinued only for the volume of the hedged item whose occurrence is no longer highly probable.
However, if an entity has a history of having designated hedges of forecast transactions and having subsequently determined that the forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, the entity's ability to predict forecast transactions accurately is called into question when predicting similar forecast transactions.
An entity can designate a new hedging relationship that involves the hedging instrument or hedged item of a previous hedging relationship for which hedge accounting was (in part or in its entirety) discontinued.
This does not constitute a continuation of a hedging relationship but is a restart.
a hedging instrument experiences such a severe credit deterioration that the entity replaces it with a new hedging instrument.
This means that the original hedging relationship failed to achieve the risk management objective and is hence discontinued in its entirety.
The new hedging instrument is designated as the hedge of the same exposure that was hedged previously and forms a new hedging relationship.
Hence, the changes in the fair value or the cash flows of the hedged item are measured starting from, and by reference to, the date of designation of the new hedging relationship instead of the date on which the original hedging relationship was designated.
a hedging relationship is discontinued before the end of its term.
The hedging instrument in that hedging relationship can be designated as the hedging instrument in another hedging relationship (for example, when adjusting the hedge ratio on rebalancing by increasing the volume of the hedging instrument or when designating a whole new hedging relationship).
An option can be considered as being related to a time period because its time value represents a charge for providing protection for the option holder over a period of time.
Hence, an entity shall assess the type of hedged item (see paragraph 6.5.15(a)) on the basis of the nature of the hedged item (regardless of whether the hedging relationship is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge)
the time value of an option relates to a transaction related hedged item if the nature of the hedged item is a transaction for which the time value has the character of costs of that transaction.
As a consequence of including the time value of the option in the initial measurement of the particular hedged item, the time value affects profit or loss at the same time as that hedged item.
For example, if an interest rate option (a cap) is used to provide protection against increases in the interest expense on a floating rate bond, the time value of that cap is amortised to profit or loss over the same period over which any intrinsic value of the cap would affect profit or loss
In that case, an entity shall recognise any changes in time value in other comprehensive income, even though the cumulative change in time value over the total period of the hedging relationship is nil.
a transaction related hedged item, the amount of time value at the end of the hedging relationship that adjusts the hedged item or that is reclassified to profit or loss (see paragraph 6.5.15(b)) would be nil.
a time-period related hedged item, the amortisation expense related to the time value is nil.
The accounting for the time value of options in accordance with paragraph 6.5.15 applies only to the extent that the time value relates to the hedged item (aligned time value).
The time value of an option relates to the hedged item if the critical terms of the option (such as the nominal amount, life and underlying) are aligned with the hedged item.
Hence, if the critical terms of the option and the hedged item are not fully aligned, an entity shall determine the aligned time value, ie how much of the time value included in the premium (actual time value) relates to the hedged item (and therefore should be treated in accordance with paragraph 6.5.15).
An entity determines the aligned time value using the valuation of the option that would have critical terms that perfectly match the hedged item.
If the actual time value and the aligned time value differ, an entity shall determine the amount that is accumulated in a separate component of equity in accordance with paragraph 6.5.15 as follows
if, at inception of the hedging relationship, the actual time value is higher than the aligned time value, the entity shall
determine the amount that is accumulated in a separate component of equity on the basis of the aligned time value; and
if, at inception of the hedging relationship, the actual time value is lower than the aligned time value, the entity shall determine the amount that is accumulated in a separate component of equity by reference to the lower of the cumulative change in fair value of
A forward contract can be considered as being related to a time period because its forward element represents charges for a period of time (which is the tenor for which it is determined).
As a consequence of including the forward element in the initial measurement of the particular hedged item, the forward element affects profit or loss at the same time as that hedged item.
The accounting for the forward element of a forward contract in accordance with paragraph 6.5.16 also applies if, at the date on which the forward contract is designated as a hedging instrument, the forward element is nil.
In that case, an entity shall recognise any fair value changes attributable to the forward element in other comprehensive income, even though the cumulative fair value change attributable to the forward element over the total period of the hedging relationship is nil. Hence, if the forward element of a forward contract relates to
a time-period related hedged item, the amortisation amount related to the forward element is nil.
The accounting for the forward element of forward contracts in accordance with paragraph 6.5.16 applies only to the extent that the forward element relates to the hedged item (aligned forward element).
The forward element of a forward contract relates to the hedged item if the critical terms of the forward contract (such as the nominal amount, life and underlying) are aligned with the hedged item.
An entity determines the aligned forward element using the valuation of the forward contract that would have critical terms that perfectly match the hedged item.
if, at inception of the hedging relationship, the absolute amount of the actual forward element is higher than that of the aligned forward element the entity shall
determine the amount that is accumulated in a separate component of equity on the basis of the aligned forward element; and
if, at inception of the hedging relationship, the absolute amount of the actual forward element is lower than that of the aligned forward element, the entity shall determine the amount that is accumulated in a separate component of equity by reference to the lower of the cumulative change in fair value of
the absolute amount of the actual forward element; and
the absolute amount of the aligned forward element.
Any remainder of the change in fair value of the actual forward element shall be recognised in profit or loss.
When an entity separates the foreign currency basis spread from a financial instrument and excludes it from the designation of that financial instrument as the hedging instrument (see paragraph 6.2.4(b)), the application guidance in paragraphs B6.5.34–B6.5.38 applies to the foreign currency basis spread in the same manner as it is applied to the forward element of a forward contract.
Hedge of a group of items (Section 6.6)
Eligibility for hedge accounting and designation of a net position
A net position is eligible for hedge accounting only if an entity hedges on a net basis for risk management purposes.
Whether an entity hedges in this way is a matter of fact (not merely of assertion or documentation).
Hence, an entity cannot apply hedge accounting on a net basis solely to achieve a particular accounting outcome if that would not reflect its risk management approach.
Normally, this hedged position would not be reflected in the financial statements because the transactions are recognised in different reporting periods in the future.
When a group of items that constitute a net position is designated as a hedged item, an entity shall designate the overall group of items that includes the items that can make up the net position.
An entity is not permitted to designate a non-specific abstract amount of a net position.
Instead, it must designate a gross amount of purchases and a gross amount of sales that together give rise to the hedged net position.
An entity shall designate gross positions that give rise to the net position so that the entity is able to comply with the requirements for the accounting for qualifying hedging relationships.
Application of the hedge effectiveness requirements to a hedge of a net position
When an entity determines whether the hedge effectiveness requirements of paragraph 6.4.1(c) are met when it hedges a net position, it shall consider the changes in the value of the items in the net position that have a similar effect as the hedging instrument in conjunction with the fair value change on the hedging instrument.
When determining whether the hedge effectiveness requirements of paragraph 6.4.1(c) are met, the entity shall consider the relationship between
the fair value change on the forward exchange contract together with the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the firm sale commitments; and
the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the firm purchase commitments.
Similarly, if in the example in paragraph B6.6.5 the entity had a nil net position it would consider the relationship between the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the firm sale commitments and the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the firm purchase commitments when determining whether the hedge effectiveness requirements of paragraph 6.4.1(c) are met.
Cash flow hedges that constitute a net position
When an entity hedges a group of items with offsetting risk positions (ie a net position), the eligibility for hedge accounting depends on the type of hedge.
If the hedge is a fair value hedge, then the net position may be eligible as a hedged item.
If, however, the hedge is a cash flow hedge, then the net position can only be eligible as a hedged item if it is a hedge of foreign currency risk and the designation of that net position specifies the reporting period in which the forecast transactions are expected to affect profit or loss and also specifies their nature and volume.
Both sales and purchases are denominated in the same foreign currency.
In order to sufficiently specify the designation of the hedged net position, the entity specifies in the original documentation of the hedging relationship that sales can be of Product A or Product B and purchases can be of Machinery Type A, Machinery Type B and Raw Material A. The entity also specifies the volumes of the transactions by each nature.
For example, the forecast transaction would be specified as
Specifying the nature of the forecast transaction volumes would include aspects such as the depreciation pattern for items of property, plant and equipment of the same kind, if the nature of those items is such that the depreciation pattern could vary depending on how the entity uses those items.
For a cash flow hedge of a net position, the amounts determined in accordance with paragraph 6.5.11 shall include the changes in the value of the items in the net position that have a similar effect as the hedging instrument in conjunction with the fair value change on the hedging instrument.
However, the changes in the value of the items in the net position that have a similar effect as the hedging instrument are recognised only once the transactions that they relate to are recognised, such as when a forecast sale is recognised as revenue.
When determining the amounts that are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance with paragraph 6.5.11(a)–6.5.11(b), the entity compares
the fair value change on the forward exchange contract together with the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the highly probable forecast sales; with
the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the highly probable forecast purchases.
Similarly, if in the example the entity had a nil net position it would compare the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the highly probable forecast sales with the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the highly probable forecast purchases.
However, those amounts are recognised only once the related forecast transactions are recognised in the financial statements.
Layers of groups of items designated as the hedged item
For the same reasons noted in paragraph B6.3.19, designating layer components of groups of existing items requires the specific identification of the nominal amount of the group of items from which the hedged layer component is defined.
A hedging relationship can include layers from several different groups of items.
For example, in a hedge of a net position of a group of assets and a group of liabilities, the hedging relationship can comprise, in combination, a layer component of the group of assets and a layer component of the group of liabilities.
Presentation of hedging instrument gains or losses
If items are hedged together as a group in a cash flow hedge, they might affect different line items in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
The presentation of hedging gains or losses in that statement depends on the group of items.
If the group of items does not have any offsetting risk positions (for example, a group of foreign currency expenses that affect different line items in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income that are hedged for foreign currency risk) then the reclassified hedging instrument gains or losses shall be apportioned to the line items affected by the hedged items.
This apportionment shall be done on a systematic and rational basis and shall not result in the grossing up of the net gains or losses arising from a single hedging instrument.
If the group of items does have offsetting risk positions (for example, a group of sales and expenses denominated in a foreign currency hedged together for foreign currency risk) then an entity shall present the hedging gains or losses in a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss on the forward exchange contract that is reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss (when the net position affects profit or loss) shall be presented in a separate line item from the hedged sales and expenses.
The related hedging gain or loss is presented in a separate line item, so that profit or loss reflects the effect of hedging the net position, with a corresponding adjustment to the cash flow hedge reserve.
For some types of fair value hedges, the objective of the hedge is not primarily to offset the fair value change of the hedged item but instead to transform the cash flows of the hedged item.
For example, an entity hedges the fair value interest rate risk of a fixed-rate debt instrument using an interest rate swap.
The entity's hedge objective is to transform the fixed-interest cash flows into floating interest cash flows.
This objective is reflected in the accounting for the hedging relationship by accruing the net interest accrual on the interest rate swap in profit or loss.
In the case of a hedge of a net position (for example, a net position of a fixed-rate asset and a fixed-rate liability), this net interest accrual must be presented in a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
This is to avoid the grossing up of a single instrument's net gains or losses into offsetting gross amounts and recognising them in different line items (for example, this avoids grossing up a net interest receipt on a single interest rate swap into gross interest revenue and gross interest expense).
Financial assets held for trading
For that purpose, an entity shall determine whether financial assets meet the definition of held for trading as if the entity had purchased the assets at the date of initial application.
On transition, an entity should seek to approximate the credit risk on initial recognition by considering all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort.
An entity is not required to undertake an exhaustive search for information when determining, at the date of transition, whether there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition.
If an entity is unable to make this determination without undue cost or effort paragraph 7.2.20 applies.
In order to determine the loss allowance on financial instruments initially recognised (or loan commitments or financial guarantee contracts to which the entity became a party to the contract) prior to the date of initial application, both on transition and until the derecognition of those items an entity shall consider information that is relevant in determining or approximating the credit risk at initial recognition.
In order to determine or approximate the initial credit risk, an entity may consider internal and external information, including portfolio information, in accordance with paragraphs B5.5.1–B5.5.6.
An entity with little historical information may use information from internal reports and statistics (that may have been generated when deciding whether to launch a new product), information about similar products or peer group experience for comparable financial instruments, if relevant.
Such a contract is a derivative even though a notional amount is not specified.
The definition of a derivative in this Standard includes contracts that are settled gross by delivery of the underlying item (eg a forward contract to purchase a fixed rate debt instrument).
An entity may have a contract to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument or by exchanging financial instruments (eg a contract to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price at a future date).
Such a contract is within the scope of this Standard unless it was entered into and continues to be held for the purpose of delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.
An option contract meets that definition because the premium is less than the investment that would be required to obtain the underlying financial instrument to which the option is linked.
A regular way purchase or sale gives rise to a fixed price commitment between trade date and settlement date that meets the definition of a derivative.
However, because of the short duration of the commitment it is not recognised as a derivative financial instrument.
The definition of a derivative refers to non-financial variables that are not specific to a party to the contract.
These include an index of earthquake losses in a particular region and an index of temperatures in a particular city.
A change in the fair value of a non-financial asset is specific to the owner if the fair value reflects not only changes in market prices for such assets (a financial variable) but also the condition of the specific non-financial asset held (a non-financial variable).
For example, if a guarantee of the residual value of a specific car exposes the guarantor to the risk of changes in the car's physical condition, the change in that residual value is specific to the owner of the car.
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Trading generally reflects active and frequent buying and selling, and financial instruments held for trading generally are used with the objective of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer's margin.
Financial liabilities held for trading include
derivative liabilities that are not accounted for as hedging instruments;
obligations to deliver financial assets borrowed by a short seller (ie an entity that sells financial assets it has borrowed and does not yet own);
financial liabilities that are incurred with an intention to repurchase them in the near term (eg a quoted debt instrument that the issuer may buy back in the near term depending on changes in its fair value); and
financial liabilities that are part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit-taking.
The fact that a liability is used to fund trading activities does not in itself make that liability one that is held for trading.
ASSESSING SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN CREDIT RISK SINCE INITIAL RECOGNITION

APPLICATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENTS ON A REPORTING DATE RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS (SECTION 5.6)
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
The entity uses LIBOR as its observable (benchmark) interest rate.
The entity assumes a flat yield curve, all changes in interest rates result from a parallel shift in the yield curve, and the changes in LIBOR are the only relevant changes in market conditions.
The entity estimates the amount of change in the fair value of the bond that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk as follows
Next, the entity calculates the present value of the cash flows associated with the liability using the liability's contractual cash flows at the end of the period and a discount rate equal to the sum of (i) the observed (benchmark) interest rate at the end of the period and (ii) the instrument-specific component of the internal rate of return as determined in accordance with paragraph B5.7.18(a).
The contractual cash flows of the instrument at the end of the period are
The difference between the observed market price of the liability at the end of the period and the amount determined in accordance with paragraph B5.7.18(b) is the change in fair value that is not attributable to changes in the observed (benchmark) interest rate.
The following examples illustrate possible ways to assess whether there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition.
However, the assessment of whether lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised is a multifactor and holistic analysis that considers reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort and that is relevant for the particular financial instrument being assessed.
In addition, the generation of revenue and cash flow was expected to be stable in Company Y's industry over the term of the senior facility.
However, there was some business risk related to the ability to grow gross margins within its existing businesses.
Subsequent to initial recognition, macroeconomic changes have had a negative effect on total sales volume and Company Y has underperformed on its business plan for revenue generation and net cash flow generation.
Although spending on inventory has increased, anticipated sales have not materialised.
To increase liquidity, Company Y has drawn down more on a separate revolving credit facility, thereby increasing its leverage ratio.
Consequently, Company Y is now close to breaching its covenants on the senior secured loan facility with Bank X.
Bank X makes an overall assessment of the credit risk on the loan to Company Y at the reporting date by taking into consideration all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort and that is relevant for assessing the extent of the increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
This may include factors such as
A further comparison with the pricing of Company Y's peers shows that reductions in the price of Company Y's bonds and increases in credit margin on its loans have probably been caused by company-specific factors.
Consequently, Bank X recognises lifetime expected credit losses on its senior secured loan to Company Y. Even if Bank X has not yet changed the internal risk grading of the loan it could still reach this conclusion — the absence or presence of a change in risk grading in itself is not determinative of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition.
Company C, is the holding company of a group that operates in a cyclical production industry.
However, input prices were volatile and given the point in the cycle, a potential decrease in sales was anticipated.
In addition, in the past Company C has been focused on external growth, acquiring majority stakes in companies in related sectors.
As a result, the group structure is complex and has been subject to change, making it difficult for investors to analyse the expected performance of the group and to forecast the cash that will be available at the holding company level.
Even though leverage is at a level that is considered acceptable by Company C's creditors at the time that Bank B originates the loan, its creditors are concerned about Company C's ability to refinance its debt because of the short remaining life until the maturity of the current financing.
There is also concern about Company C's ability to continue to service interest using the dividends it receives from its operating subsidiaries.
Bank B applies its own internal rating methods to determine credit risk and allocates a specific internal rating score to its loans.
Bank B's internal rating categories are based on historical, current and forward-looking information and reflect the credit risk for the tenor of the loans.
On initial recognition, Bank B determines that the loan is subject to considerable credit risk, has speculative elements and that the uncertainties affecting Company C, including the group's uncertain prospects for cash generation, could lead to default.
Company C has also announced a corporate restructure to streamline its operating subsidiaries.
This restructuring will increase the flexibility to refinance existing debt and the ability of the operating subsidiaries to pay dividends to Company C.
As a consequence, Bank B does not recognise a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses on the loan.
These negative effects on Company H's operations could be significant and ongoing.
As a result of these recent events and expected adverse economic conditions, Company H's free cash flow is expected to be reduced to the point that the coverage of scheduled loan payments could become tight.
Bank Z estimates that a further deterioration in cash flows may result in Company H missing a contractual payment on the loan and becoming past due.
It notes that the loan is subject to considerable credit risk at the reporting date because even a slight deterioration in cash flows could result in Company H missing a contractual payment on the loan.
Company A is a large listed national logistics company.
This is because the bond has a low risk of default and Company A is considered to have a strong capacity to meet its obligations in the near term.
Entity B's expectations for the longer term are that adverse changes in economic and business conditions may, but will not necessarily, reduce Company A's ability to fulfil its obligations on the bond.
In addition, at initial recognition the bond had an internal credit rating that is correlated to a global external credit rating of investment grade.
At the reporting date, Entity B's main credit risk concern is the continuing pressure on the total volume of sales that has caused Company A's operating cash flows to decrease.
Accordingly, at the reporting date, Entity B evaluates whether the bond is considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort.
In making that evaluation, Entity B reassesses the internal credit rating of the bond and concludes that the bond is no longer equivalent to an investment grade rating because
However, at the reporting date the external credit risk rating was unchanged.
While Company A currently has the capacity to meet its commitments, the large uncertainties arising from its exposure to adverse business and economic conditions have increased the risk of a default occurring on the bond.
As a result of the factors described in paragraph IE27, Entity B determines that the bond does not have low credit risk at the reporting date.
As a result, Entity B needs to determine whether the increase in credit risk since initial recognition has been significant.
The mortgage loans are originated across a wide range of LTV criteria and a wide range of income groups.
As part of the mortgage application process, customers are required to provide information such as the industry within which the customer is employed and the post code of the property that serves as collateral on the mortgage.
Bank ABC sets its acceptance criteria based on credit scores.
Loans with a credit score above the 'acceptance level' are approved because these borrowers are considered to be able to meet contractual payment obligations.
When new mortgage loans are originated, Bank ABC uses the credit score to determine the risk of a default occurring as at initial recognition.
At the reporting date Bank ABC determines that economic conditions are expected to deteriorate significantly in all regions.
Unemployment levels are expected to increase while the value of residential property is expected to decrease, causing the LTV ratios to increase.
As a result of the expected deterioration in economic conditions, Bank ABC expects default rates on the mortgage portfolio to increase.
Its scoring models are based on current and historical past due statuses, levels of customer indebtedness, LTV measures, customer behaviour on other financial instruments with Bank ABC, the loan size and the time since the origination of the loan.
Bank ABC updates the LTV measures on a regular basis through an automated process that re-estimates property values using recent sales in each post code area and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort.
Bank ABC has historical data that indicates a strong correlation between the value of residential property and the default rates for mortgages.
That is, when the value of residential property declines, a customer has less economic incentive to make scheduled mortgage repayments, increasing the risk of a default occurring.
Through the impact of the LTV measure in the behavioural scoring model, an increased risk of a default occurring due to an expected decline in residential property value adjusts the behavioural scores.
Mortgages with a high LTV ratio are more sensitive to changes in the value of the residential property and Bank ABC is able to identify significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition on individual customers before a mortgage becomes past due if there has been a deterioration in the behavioural score.
When the increase in credit risk has been significant, a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is recognised.
The higher the LTV measure, the higher the expected credit losses all else being equal.
If Bank ABC was unable to update behavioural scores to reflect the expected declines in property prices, it would use reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort to undertake a collective assessment to determine the loans on which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and recognise lifetime expected credit losses for those loans.
Instead, for credit risk management purposes, Bank ABC tracks the risk of a default occurring by means of past due statuses.
Bank ABC becomes aware of a significant decline in coal exports and anticipates the closure of several coal mines.
Because of the expected increase in the unemployment rate, the risk of a default occurring on mortgage loans to borrowers who are employed by the coal mines is determined to have increased significantly, even if those customers are not past due at the reporting date.
Bank ABC therefore segments its mortgage portfolio by the industry within which customers are employed (using the information recorded as part of the mortgage application process) to identify customers that rely on coal mining as the dominant source of employment (ie a 'bottom up' approach in which loans are identified based on a common risk characteristic).
However, some of these mortgages may experience significant increases in credit risk soon after initial recognition because of the expected closure of the coal mines.
In Region Three, Bank ABC anticipates the risk of a default occurring and thus an increase in credit risk, as a result of an expected increase in interest rates during the expected life of the mortgages.
Bank ABC determines that the variable interest-rate portfolio of mortgages in Region Three is homogenous and that unlike for Region Two, it is not possible to identify particular sub portfolios on the basis of shared risk characteristics that represent customers who are expected to have increased significantly in credit risk.
However, as a result of the homogenous nature of the mortgages in Region Three, Bank ABC determines that an assessment can be made of a proportion of the overall portfolio that has significantly increased in credit risk since initial recognition (ie a 'top down' approach can be used).
This means that Bank A does not have to know the initial credit rating of each loan in the portfolio to assess the change in credit risk since initial recognition.
Bank A assesses credit risk on a counterparty level for credit risk management purposes and determines that the increase in Company Q's credit risk is significant.
The counterparty assessment would therefore achieve the same result as assessing the change in credit risk for each loan individually.
The fact that Company X's credit risk (assessed on a counterparty basis) has previously been assessed to have increased significantly, does not result in lifetime expected credit losses being recognised on the new loan.
This is because the credit risk on the new loan has not increased significantly since the loan was initially recognised.
Recognition and measurement of expected credit losses
At the reporting date Entity B therefore uses changes in the lifetime PD to determine whether the credit risk of the portfolio has increased significantly since initial recognition.
Bank A segments its portfolio into borrower groups (Groups X and Y) on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics at initial recognition.
There are no transaction costs and the loan contracts include no options (for example, prepayment or call options), premiums or discounts, points paid, or other fees.
In addition, Bank A considers forward-looking information, and updates its historical information for current economic conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.
Number of clients in sample
Estimated per client gross carrying amount at default
Total estimated gross carrying amount at default
Historic per annum average defaults
Estimated total gross carrying amount at default
Present value of observed loss
On the basis of the expected life of the loans, Bank A determines that the expected increase in defaults does not represent a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition for the portfolios.
Bank A provides co-branded credit cards to customers in conjunction with a local department store.
However, Bank A does not enforce its contractual right to cancel the credit cards in the normal day-to-day management of the instruments and only cancels facilities when it becomes aware of an increase in credit risk and starts to monitor customers on an individual basis.
Bank A therefore does not consider the contractual right to cancel the credit cards to limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period.
For credit risk management purposes Bank A considers that there is only one set of contractual cash flows from customers to assess and does not distinguish between the drawn and undrawn balances at the reporting date.
The portfolio is therefore managed and expected credit losses are measured on a facility level.
Bank A determines the expected life of the portfolio by estimating the period over which it expects to be exposed to credit risk on the facilities at the reporting date, taking into account
the period over which it was exposed to credit risk on a similar portfolio of credit cards;
the length of time for related defaults to occur on similar financial instruments; and
past events that led to credit risk management actions because of an increase in credit risk on similar financial instruments, such as the reduction or removal of undrawn credit limits.
Bank A measures expected credit losses on a facility level and therefore cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment component from those on the loan component.
It recognises expected credit losses for the undrawn commitment together with the loss allowance for the loan component in the statement of financial position.
The modification does not result in the derecognition of the loan by Bank A.
Bank A also remeasures the loss allowance, taking into account the modified contractual cash flows and evaluates whether the loss allowance for the loan shall continue to be measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
Bank A compares the current credit risk (taking into consideration the modified cash flows) to the credit risk (on the original unmodified cash flows) at initial recognition.
Bank A determines that the loan is not credit-impaired at the reporting date but that credit risk has still significantly increased compared to the credit risk at initial recognition and continues to measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
Given the positive overall development, Bank A re-assesses the situation and concludes that the credit risk of the loan has decreased and there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
The customer base consists of a large number of small clients and the trade receivables are categorised by common risk characteristics that are representative of the customers' abilities to pay all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms.
At every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
On that basis, Company M estimates the following provision matrix
Lifetime expected credit loss allowance (Gross carrying amount x lifetime expected credit loss rate)
At initial recognition the entity determines that the asset is not purchased or originated credit-impaired.
For simplicity, journal entries for the receipt of interest revenue are not provided.
Impairment loss (profit or loss)
This example illustrates the accounting relating to a debt instrument denominated in a foreign currency, measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and designated in a fair value hedge accounting relationship.
The example illustrates the interaction with accounting for impairment.
At initial recognition the entity determines that the bond is not purchased or originated credit-impaired.
The entity has the following risk exposures
fair value interest rate risk in FC: the exposure that arises as a result of purchasing a fixed interest rate instrument; and
foreign exchange risk: the exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates measured in LC.
The entity hedges its risk exposures using the following risk management strategy
for fixed interest rate risk (in FC) the entity decides to link its interest receipts in FC to current variable interest rates in FC.
Consequently, the entity uses interest rate swaps denominated in FC under which it pays fixed interest and receives variable interest in FC; and
for foreign exchange risk the entity decides not to hedge against any variability in LC arising from changes in foreign exchange rates.
This is reflected in the following table
The bond is a monetary asset.
For simplicity, journal entries for the recognition of interest revenue are not provided.
It is assumed that interest accrued is received in the period.
In accordance with paragraph 16A of IFRS 7, the loss allowance for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income is not presented separately as a reduction of the carrying amount of the financial asset.
However, disclosure would be provided about the accumulated impairment amount recognised in other comprehensive income.
Profit or loss (impairment loss)
Other comprehensive income (accumulated impairment amount)
The journal entries to derecognise the bond and reclassify the gains and losses that have accumulated in other comprehensive income would be as follows
Application of the impairment requirements on a reporting date
Bank A reclassifies the portfolio of bonds out of the amortised cost measurement category and into the fair value through profit or loss measurement category.
At the reclassification date, the portfolio of bonds is measured at fair value.
Any gain or loss arising from a difference between the previous amortised cost amount of the portfolio of bonds and the fair value of the portfolio of bonds is recognised in profit or loss on reclassification.
Bonds (gross carrying amount of the amortised cost assets)
Reclassification loss (profit or loss)
Bank A reclassifies the portfolio of bonds out of the fair value through profit or loss measurement category and into the amortised cost measurement category.
At the reclassification date, the fair value of the portfolio of bonds becomes the new gross carrying amount and the effective interest rate is determined based on that gross carrying amount.
The impairment requirements apply to the bond from the reclassification date.
For the purposes of recognising expected credit losses, the credit risk of the portfolio of bonds at the reclassification date becomes the credit risk against which future changes in credit risk shall be compared.
Bank A reclassifies the portfolio of bonds out of the amortised cost measurement category and into the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category.
Any gain or loss arising from a difference between the previous amortised cost amount of the portfolio of bonds and the fair value of the portfolio of bonds is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The credit risk at initial recognition continues to be used to assess changes in credit risk.
From the reclassification date the loss allowance ceases to be recognised as an adjustment to the gross carrying amount of the bond and is recognised as an accumulated impairment amount, which would be disclosed.
Bonds (gross carrying amount of amortised cost assets)
(To recognise the reclassification from amortised cost to fair value through other comprehensive income.
Bank A reclassifies the portfolio of bonds out of the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category and into the amortised cost measurement category.
The portfolio of bonds is reclassified at fair value.
However, at the reclassification date, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is removed from equity and adjusted against the fair value of the portfolio of bonds.
As a result, the portfolio of bonds is measured at the reclassification date as if it had always been measured at amortised cost.
The credit risk at initial recognition continues to be used to assess changes in the credit risk on the bonds.
The loss allowance is recognised as an adjustment to the gross carrying amount of the bond (to reflect the amortised cost amount) from the reclassification date.
Bonds (gross carrying value of the amortised cost assets)
(To recognise the reclassification from fair value through other comprehensive income to amortised cost including the recognition of the loss allowance deducted to determine the amortised cost amount.
Bank A reclassifies the portfolio of bonds out of the fair value through profit or loss measurement category and into the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category.
The portfolio of bonds continues to be measured at fair value.
However, for the purposes of applying the effective interest method, the fair value of the portfolio of bonds at the reclassification date becomes the new gross carrying amount and the effective interest rate is determined based on that new gross carrying amount.
The impairment requirements apply from the reclassification date.
(To recognise the reclassification of bonds from fair value through profit or loss to fair value through other comprehensive income including commencing accounting for impairment.
Bank A reclassifies the portfolio of bonds out of the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category and into the fair value through profit or loss measurement category.
Hedge accounting for aggregated exposures
The following examples illustrate the mechanics of hedge accounting for aggregated exposures.
Entity A has the following risk exposures
commodity price risk: the variability in cash flows for the purchase price, which results from fluctuations of the spot price of coffee in FC; and
Entity A hedges its risk exposures using the following risk management strategy
Entity A does not hedge this risk because it is not considered economical under cost / benefit considerations.
However, Entity A's actual aggregated exposure is affected by changes in the basis spread.
Forward purchase contract for coffee
Change in cash flow hedge reserve
FX forward contract (buy FC/sell LC)
the hedged coffee purchase volume multiplied by the current forward price (this represents the expected spot price of the actual coffee purchase); and
the volume of the hedging instrument (designated nominal amount) multiplied by the difference between the contractual forward rate and the current forward rate (this represents the expected price differential from benchmark coffee price movements in FC that Entity A will receive or pay under the commodity forward contract).
Cash price (at spot for commodity price risk and FX risk)
Gain / loss from CFHR for commodity price risk
Gain / loss from CFHR for FX risk
This hedge ineffectiveness has a cash flow effect but is excluded from the measurement of the inventory.
Entity B wants to hedge a fixed rate liability that is denominated in Foreign Currency (FC).
fair value interest rate risk and FX risk: the changes in fair value of the fixed rate liability attributable to interest rate changes, measured in LC.
Entity B hedges its risk exposures using the following risk management strategy
Entity B hedges its FC denominated liabilities (including the interest) for their entire life.
Consequently, Entity B enters into a cross-currency interest rate swap at the same time as it issues an FC denominated liability.
Under the cross-currency interest rate swap Entity B receives fixed interest in FC (used to pay the interest on the liability) and pays variable interest in LC.
From time to time, in accordance with its risk management strategy for variable rate interest rate risk (in LC), Entity B decides to lock in its interest payments and hence swaps its aggregated variable rate exposure in LC into a fixed rate exposure in LC.
CCIRS (receive fixed FC/pay variable LC)
IRS (receive variable / pay fixed)
CF variability of the aggregated exposure
The cash flow variability of the aggregated exposure is calculated as follows
This calculation establishes the single blended fixed coupon rate (reference rate) that is used at subsequent dates as the reference point to measure the cash flow variability of the aggregated exposure since the start of the hedging relationship.
This calculation is illustrated in the following table
Variability in cash flows of the aggregated exposure
The total of all those present values represents the cash flow variability of the aggregated exposure.
Change in fair value of the CCIRS
Total other gains / losses
The total interest expense in profit or loss reflects Entity B's interest expense that results from its risk management strategy
There is also some hedge ineffectiveness that results from a difference in the changes in value for the fixed rate FX liability (as represented by the fair value hedge adjustment) and the cross-currency interest rate swap.
However, Entity B's interest expense is affected by the hedge ineffectiveness that arises on its hedging relationships.
Entity C wants to hedge a variable rate liability that is denominated in Foreign Currency (FC).
cash flow interest rate risk and FX risk: the changes in cash flows of the variable rate liability attributable to interest rate changes, measured in LC.
Entity C hedges its risk exposures using the following risk management strategy
Entity C hedges its FC denominated liabilities (including the interest) for their entire life.
Consequently, Entity C enters into a cross-currency interest rate swap at the same time as it issues an FC denominated liability.
Under the cross-currency interest rate swap Entity C receives variable interest in FC (used to pay the interest on the liability) and pays fixed interest in LC.
From time to time, in accordance with its risk management strategy for fixed rate interest rate risk (in LC), Entity C decides to link its interest payments to current variable interest rate levels and hence swaps its aggregated fixed rate exposure in LC into a variable rate exposure in LC.
Consequently, Entity C uses interest rate swaps (denominated entirely in LC) under which it receives fixed interest (used to pay the interest on the pay leg of the cross-currency interest rate swap) and pays variable interest.
CCIRS (receive variable FC/pay fixed LC)
IRS (receive fixed / pay variable)
Change in present value of the aggregated exposure
Consequently, applying fair value hedge accounting with the aggregated exposure as the hedged item does not result in changing the hedged item's measurement but instead affects where the hedging gains and losses are recognised (ie reclassification from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss).
The change in value of the aggregated exposure is calculated as follows
This calculation establishes the present value that is used at subsequent dates as the reference point to measure the change in present value of the aggregated exposure since the start of the hedging relationship.
Present value of the aggregated exposure
The total of those present values represents the present value of the aggregated exposure.

Is the contract accounted for as a derivative?
While such a contract meets the definition of a derivative, it is not necessarily accounted for as a derivative.
The contract is a derivative instrument because there is no initial net investment, the contract is based on the price of copper, and it is to be settled at a future date.
Entity XYZ owns an office building.
The option, if exercised, may be settled through physical delivery or net cash, at XYZ's option.
How do both XYZ and the investor account for the option?
XYZ's accounting depends on XYZ's intention and past practice for settlement.
In addition, the option may be settled net in cash.
Therefore, the investor has to account for the contract as a derivative.
Regardless of past practices, the investor's intention does not affect whether settlement is by delivery or in cash.
However, if the contract were a forward contract instead of an option, and if the contract required physical delivery and the reporting entity had no past practice of settling net in cash or of taking delivery of the building and selling it within a short period after delivery for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer's margin, the contract would not be accounted for as a derivative.
Is gold bullion a financial instrument (like cash) or is it a commodity?
Although bullion is highly liquid, there is no contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset inherent in bullion.
B.2 Definition of a derivative: examples of derivatives and underlyings
What are examples of common derivative contracts and the identified underlying?
Main pricing-settlement variable (underlying variable)
Currency swap (foreign exchange swap)
Equity prices (equity of another entity)
Credit rating, credit index or credit price
Total fair value of the reference asset and interest rates
Purchased or written treasury bond option (call or put)
Purchased or written currency option (call or put)
Purchased or written commodity option (call or put)
Purchased or written stock option (call or put)
Interest rate futures linked to government debt (treasury futures)
Interest rate forward linked to government debt (treasury forward)
The list is not exhaustive.
Any contract that has an underlying may be a derivative.
Therefore, an entity must evaluate the contract to determine whether the other characteristics of a derivative are present and whether special provisions apply.
For the purpose of determining whether an interest rate swap is a derivative financial instrument under IFRS 9, does it make a difference whether the parties pay the interest payments to each other (gross settlement) or settle on a net basis?
The definition of a derivative does not depend on gross or net settlement.
ABC and XYZ do not exchange the notional amount.
Alternatively, settlement may be on a gross basis.
The contract meets the definition of a derivative regardless of whether there is net or gross settlement because its value changes in response to changes in an underlying variable (LIBOR), there is no initial net investment, and settlements occur at future dates.
If a party prepays its obligation under a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap at inception, is the swap a derivative financial instrument?
The initial net investment in the interest rate swap is significantly less than the notional amount on which the variable payments under the variable leg will be calculated.
The contract requires an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors, such as a variable rate bond.
Even though Entity S has no future performance obligation, the ultimate settlement of the contract is at a future date and the value of the contract changes in response to changes in the LIBOR index.
Accordingly, the contract is regarded as a derivative contract.
Would the answer change if the fixed rate payment obligation is prepaid subsequent to initial recognition?
The prepaid amount fails the 'no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors' criterion of a derivative.
Therefore, all else being equal, the initial investment in the contract should equal that of other financial instruments that consist of fixed annuities.
Thus, the initial net investment in the pay-variable, receive-fixed interest rate swap is equal to the investment required in a non-derivative contract that has a similar response to changes in market conditions.
By discharging the obligation to pay variable interest rate payments, Entity S in effect provides a loan to Counterparty C.
Is this a derivative under IFRS 9?
This meets the definition of a derivative (that is to say, there is an underlying variable, no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors, and future settlement).
The contractual effect of the loans is the equivalent of an interest rate swap arrangement with no initial net investment.
Non-derivative transactions are aggregated and treated as a derivative when the transactions result, in substance, in a derivative.
Indicators of this would include
they have the same counterparty
they relate to the same risk
there is no apparent economic need or substantive business purpose for structuring the transactions separately that could not also have been accomplished in a single transaction.
B.7 Definition of a derivative: option not expected to be exercised
Is this criterion met even if an option is expected not to be exercised, for example, because it is out of the money?
An option is settled upon exercise or at its maturity.
Expiry at maturity is a form of settlement even though there is no additional exchange of consideration.
Entity XYZ, whose functional currency is the US dollar, sells products in France denominated in euro.
XYZ enters into a contract with an investment bank to convert euro to US dollars at a fixed exchange rate.
Is that contract a derivative?
Is the forward contract a derivative?
The forward contract fails the 'no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors' test for a derivative.
Accordingly, the prepaid forward contract does not meet the initial net investment criterion of a derivative instrument.
B.10 Definition of a derivative: initial net investment
Many derivative instruments, such as futures contracts and exchange traded written options, require margin accounts.
Is the margin account part of the initial net investment?
The margin account is not part of the initial net investment in a derivative instrument.
Margin accounts are a form of collateral for the counterparty or clearing house and may take the form of cash, securities or other specified assets, typically liquid assets.
Margin accounts are separate assets that are accounted for separately.
What is a 'portfolio' for the purposes of applying this definition?
If there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking on financial instruments included in such a portfolio, those financial instruments qualify as held for trading even though an individual financial instrument may in fact be held for a longer period of time.
B.24 Definition of gross carrying amount: perpetual debt instruments with fixed or market-based variable rate
Sometimes entities purchase or issue debt instruments that are required to be measured at amortised cost and in respect of which the issuer has no obligation to repay the gross carrying amount.
The interest rate may be fixed or variable.
Since there are no repayment of the gross carrying amount, there is no amortisation of the difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount if the rate of interest is fixed or specified as a market-based variable rate.
Because interest payments are fixed or market-based and will be paid in perpetuity, the amortised cost (the present value of the stream of future cash payments discounted at the effective interest rate) equals the gross carrying amount in each period.
If the stated rate of interest on a perpetual debt instrument decreases over time, would the gross carrying amount equal the contractual par amount in each period?
From an economic perspective, some or all of the contractual interest payments are repayments of the gross carrying amount.
How is the gross carrying amount calculated for financial assets measured at amortised cost in accordance with IFRS 9?
The gross carrying amount is calculated using the effective interest method.
The effective interest rate inherent in a financial instrument is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated cash flows associated with the financial instrument through the expected life of the instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the gross carrying amount at initial recognition.
The computation includes all fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, directly attributable transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
The contract also specifies that the borrower has an option to prepay the instrument at par and that no penalty will be charged for prepayment.
At inception, the entity expects the borrower not to prepay (and, therefore, the entity determines that the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant when the financial asset is initially recognised).
The table below provides information about the gross carrying amount, interest revenue and cash flows of the debt instrument in each reporting period.
The table below provides information about the gross carrying amount, interest revenue and cash flows as they would be adjusted taking into account the change in estimate.
B.27 Example of calculating the gross carrying amount: debt instruments with stepped interest payments
Although there is no difference between the initial amount and maturity amount, an entity uses the effective interest method to allocate interest payments over the term of the debt instrument to achieve a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Therefore, cash interest payments are reallocated over the term of the debt instrument for the purposes of determining the gross carrying amount in each period.
Any cash payments in the period are deducted from the resulting number.
Accordingly, the gross carrying amount in each period is as follows
B.28 Regular way contracts: no established market
Can a contract to purchase a financial asset be a regular way contract if there is no established market for trading such a contract?
Marketplace is not limited to a formal stock exchange or organised over-the-counter market.
Instead, it means the environment in which the financial asset is customarily exchanged.
An acceptable time frame would be the period reasonably and customarily required for the parties to complete the transaction and prepare and execute closing documents.
For example, a market for private issue financial instruments can be a marketplace.
The contract is with an individual and is not an exchange-traded contract.
Is the forward contract regarded as a regular way contract?
The contract must be accounted for as a derivative because it is not settled in the way established by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned.
The provisions that apply are those in the market in which the purchase actually takes place.
B.31 Regular way contracts: share purchase by call option
Do these rules apply to transactions in financial instruments that are classified as financial liabilities, such as transactions in deposit liabilities and trading liabilities?
If an embedded non-option derivative is required to be separated from a host debt instrument, how are the terms of the host debt instrument and the embedded derivative identified?
The terms of the host debt instrument reflect the stated or implied substantive terms of the hybrid contract.
In the absence of implied or stated terms, the entity makes its own judgement of the terms.
If it were permitted to separate embedded non-option derivatives on other terms, a single hybrid contract could be decomposed into an infinite variety of combinations of host debt instruments and embedded derivatives, for example, by separating embedded derivatives with terms that create leverage, asymmetry or some other risk exposure not already present in the hybrid contract.
The determination of the terms of the embedded derivative is based on the conditions existing when the financial instrument was issued.
The economic behaviour of a hybrid contract with an option-based embedded derivative depends critically on the strike price (or strike rate) specified for the option feature in the hybrid contract, as discussed below.
Therefore, the separation of an option-based embedded derivative (including any embedded put, call, cap, floor, caption, floortion or swaption feature in a hybrid contract) should be based on the stated terms of the option feature documented in the hybrid contract.
In this case, the fair value of the option would consist only of time value.
However, such an assumption would not be consistent with the likely economic behaviour of the hybrid contract, including the probability of the option feature being exercised, unless the agreed strike price was indeed equal to the price (or rate) of the underlying variable at the initial recognition of the hybrid contract.
Adjusting the strike price of an option-based embedded derivative, therefore, alters the nature of the hybrid contract.
In some instances, venture capital entities providing subordinated loans agree that if and when the borrower lists its shares on a stock exchange, the venture capital entity is entitled to receive shares of the borrowing entity free of charge or at a very low price (an 'equity kicker') in addition to the contractual payments.
As a result of the equity kicker feature, the interest on the subordinated loan is lower than it would otherwise be.
Assuming that the subordinated loan is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss (paragraph 4.3.3(c) of IFRS 9), does the equity kicker feature meet the definition of an embedded derivative even though it is contingent upon the future listing of the borrower?
The economic characteristics and risks of an equity return are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of a host debt instrument (paragraph 4.3.3(a) of IFRS 9).
The equity kicker meets the definition of a derivative because it has a value that changes in response to the change in the price of the shares of the borrower, it requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors, and it is settled at a future date (paragraph 4.3.3(b) and Appendix A of IFRS 9).
An equity kicker feature is similar to such a derivative except that it does not give a right to a fixed payment, but an option right, if the future event occurs.
Embedded derivative instruments are terms and conditions that are included in non-derivative host contracts.
Each of the financial instruments has its own terms and conditions and each may be transferred or settled separately.
Therefore, the debt instrument and the swap are classified separately.
The transactions described here differ from the transactions discussed in Question B.6, which had no substance apart from the resulting interest rate swap.
Is there an embedded derivative that should be separated under IFRS 9?
To illustrate: a Norwegian entity agrees to sell oil to an entity in France.
The French entity regards the supply contact as a host contract with an embedded foreign currency forward to sell Swiss francs.
Each entity includes fair value changes on the currency forward in profit or loss unless the reporting entity designates it as a cash flow hedging instrument, if appropriate.
C.8 Embedded foreign currency derivatives: unrelated foreign currency provision
C.9 Embedded foreign currency derivatives: currency of international commerce
For example, if cross-border transactions in natural gas in North America are routinely denominated in US dollars and such transactions are routinely denominated in euro in Europe, neither the US dollar nor the euro is a currency in which the goods or services are routinely denominated in commercial transactions around the world.
The condition that 'the holder would not recover substantially all of its recognised investment' is not satisfied if the terms of the combined contract permit, but do not require, the investor to settle the combined contract in a manner that causes it not to recover substantially all of its recognised investment and the issuer has no such right.
Accordingly, an interest-bearing host contract with an embedded interest rate derivative with such terms is regarded as closely related to the host contract.
The condition that 'the holder would not recover substantially all of its recognised investment' applies to situations in which the holder can be forced to accept settlement at an amount that causes the holder not to recover substantially all of its recognised investment.
Section D Recognition and derecognition
Entity B transfers cash to Entity A as collateral for another transaction with Entity A (for example, a securities borrowing transaction).
D.2.1 Trade date vs settlement date: amounts to be recorded for a purchase
Financial assets measured at amortised cost
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Other comprehensive income (fair value adjustment)
Retained earnings (through profit or loss)
D.2.2 Trade date vs settlement date: amounts to be recorded for a sale
A change in the fair value of a financial asset that is sold on a regular way basis is not recorded in the financial statements between trade date and settlement date even if the entity applies settlement date accounting because the seller's right to changes in the fair value ceases on the trade date.
In that case, the entity recognises a liability of an amount equal to the carrying amount of the financial asset to be delivered on settlement date.
Entity A uses settlement date accounting for financial assets measured at amortised cost and trade date accounting for assets that meet the definition of held for trading.
The following entries are made
E.1 Initial measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities
Transaction costs should be included in the initial measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities other than those at fair value through profit or loss.
How should this requirement be applied in practice?
For financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs are added to the fair value at initial recognition.
For financial liabilities, transaction costs are deducted from the fair value at initial recognition.
For financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost, transaction costs are subsequently included in the calculation of amortised cost using the effective interest method and, in effect, amortised through profit or loss over the life of the instrument.
Transaction costs expected to be incurred on transfer or disposal of a financial instrument are not included in the measurement of the financial instrument.
How is the cumulative gain or loss that is recognised in other comprehensive income determined?
To illustrate: Entity A is domiciled in Country X and its functional currency and presentation currency are the local currency of Country X (LCX).
For example, if a monetary financial asset (such as a debt instrument) is measured at amortised cost in accordance with IFRS 9, amortised cost is calculated in the currency of denomination of that financial asset.
This exception applies to non-monetary items that are carried in terms of historical cost in the foreign currency and are hedged against exposure to foreign currency rates (paragraph 23(b) of IAS 21).
The recognition of a change in the carrying amount of a financial asset or financial liability in profit or loss depends on a number of factors, including whether it is an exchange difference or other change in carrying amount, whether it arises on a monetary item (for example, most debt instruments) or non-monetary item (such as most equity investments), whether the associated asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge of an exposure to changes in foreign currency rates, and whether it results from translating the financial statements of a foreign operation.
The issue of recognising changes in the carrying amount of a financial asset or financial liability held by a foreign operation is addressed in a separate question (see Question E.3.3).
Differences arising from recognising a monetary item at a foreign currency amount different from that at which it was previously recognised are accounted for in a similar manner, since all changes in the carrying amount relating to foreign currency movements should be treated consistently.
For example, although an entity recognises gains and losses on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in other comprehensive income (paragraphs 5.7.10 and B5.7.2A of IFRS 9), the entity nevertheless recognises the changes in the carrying amount relating to changes in foreign exchange rates in profit or loss (paragraph 23(a) of IAS 21).
How should cash flows arising from hedging instruments be classified in statements of cash flows?
Cash flows arising from hedging instruments are classified as operating, investing or financing activities, on the basis of the classification of the cash flows arising from the hedged item.
This term (as defined in IFRS 7) is used in the requirements for presenting the effects of changes in credit risk on liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss (see paragraph 5.7.7).
In this Standard monetary amounts are denominated in 'currency units' (CU) and 'foreign currency units' (FC).
Lifetime expected credit losses would also be recognised on those mortgages.
However, for purposes of this example, the present value of the observed loss is assumed.
(a) FVOCI means fair value through other comprehensive income.
(a) In case of items measured in the functional currency of an entity the journal entry recognising expected credit losses will usually be made at the reporting date.
(a) For simplicity, the amount related to impairment is not shown separately.
Consequently, the entire coffee price risk is hedged.
For such a strategy the hedge effectiveness is measured based on the difference between the forward rates that existed at the start of the hedging relationship and the forward rates that exist at the effectiveness measurement date for the individual interest periods.
For such a strategy a series of forward contracts corresponding with the individual interest periods would be more effective than an interest rate swap (that has a fixed payment leg with a single blended fixed rate).
Consequently, the absolute values of the variable rate FX liability and the FC denominated leg of the cross-currency interest rate are equal (but with opposite signs).
In situations in which hedge ineffectiveness arises, those absolute values would not be equal so that the remaining net amount would affect the present value of the aggregated exposure.
Background Information and Basis for Conclusions
The Preface to the CPA Canada Handbook – Accounting (Handbook) defines the various categories of reporting entity and specifies which Part of the Handbook applies to each category.
This Introduction provides information specific to the use of Part I and should be read in conjunction with the Preface.
Newly issued, amended or revised IFRS Standards are part of Canadian GAAP only after they are approved by the Accounting Standards Board in accordance with its due process.
IFRS Standards that are not currently effective on a mandatory basis are located in a separate section entitled "IFRS® Standards issued but not yet effective."
IFRS Standards that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but for which the due process of the Accounting Standards Board is yet to be completed are not incorporated in the Handbook.
The policy of the Accounting Standards Board is to adopt IFRS® Standards without modification.
However, in circumstances expected to be rare and after following its due process, the Accounting Standards Board may decide not to adopt an IFRS Standard or to modify it when adopting it into Canadian GAAP.
At present, no such decisions have been taken and the Handbook includes all effective IFRS Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Such material is being incorporated into the Handbook gradually and on a priority basis that considers the implementation needs of Canadians.
This Part of the Handbook does not include the IFRS for SMEs® Standard.
Consequently, an entity choosing to apply that standard is not permitted to state that its financial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP.
The mandatory date specified in paragraph I.7 or I.9 does not apply to entities that initially apply the standards in Part II or Part III of the Handbook and subsequently adopt this Part of the Handbook.
In such cases, this Part applies from the date chosen by the private enterprise or not-for-profit organization, or the date at which an entity becomes a publicly accountable enterprise and is required to apply the IFRS® Standards in this Part.
An entity that prepares its financial statements in accordance with this Part of the Handbook states that they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS® Standards.
An entity that prepares its financial statements in accordance with this Part of the Handbook is permitted, but not required, to make the additional statement that its financial statements are in accordance with Canadian GAAP.
The term "IFRS® Standards" includes IFRS® Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), International Accounting Standards (IASs) as issued by the IASB's predecessor, the Board of the International Accounting Standards Committee, and adopted by the IASB upon its inception, and Interpretations developed by the IFRS® Interpretations Committee (previously named the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)) or its predecessor, the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF PARTIES TO A JOINT ARRANGEMENT
C   Effective date, transition and withdrawal of other IFRSs
All the parties, or a group of the parties, control the arrangement collectively when they must act together to direct the activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement (ie the relevant activities).
A party with joint control of an arrangement can prevent any of the other parties, or a group of the parties, from controlling the arrangement.
This IFRS distinguishes between parties that have joint control of a joint arrangement (joint operators or joint venturers) and parties that participate in, but do not have joint control of, a joint arrangement.
An entity shall make this assessment by considering all facts and circumstances (see paragraphs B5–B11).
The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement.
Those parties are called joint venturers.
An entity shall determine the type of joint arrangement in which it is involved by considering its rights and obligations arising from the arrangement.
An entity assesses its rights and obligations by considering the structure and legal form of the arrangement, the terms agreed by the parties in the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances (see paragraphs B12–B33).
The framework agreement might set out that the parties establish different joint arrangements to deal with specific activities that form part of the agreement.
Even though those joint arrangements are related to the same framework agreement, their type might be different if the parties' rights and obligations differ when undertaking the different activities dealt with in the framework agreement.
Consequently, joint operations and joint ventures can coexist when the parties undertake different activities that form part of the same framework agreement.
Financial statements of parties to a joint arrangement
its assets, including its share of any assets held jointly;
its liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly;
its revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation;
its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and
This applies to the acquisition of both the initial interest and additional interests in a joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business.
The accounting for the acquisition of an interest in such a joint operation is specified in paragraphs B33A–B33D.
If a party that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a joint operation does not have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to that joint operation, it shall account for its interest in the joint operation in accordance with the IFRSs applicable to that interest.
The contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
A joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
A party to a joint operation that has joint control of that joint operation.
A joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
A party to a joint venture that has joint control of that joint venture.
An entity that participates in a joint arrangement, regardless of whether that entity has joint control of the arrangement.
Contractual arrangements can be evidenced in several ways.
An enforceable contractual arrangement is often, but not always, in writing, usually in the form of a contract or documented discussions between the parties.
Statutory mechanisms can also create enforceable arrangements, either on their own or in conjunction with contracts between the parties.
When joint arrangements are structured through a separate vehicle (see paragraphs B19–B33), the contractual arrangement, or some aspects of the contractual arrangement, will in some cases be incorporated in the articles, charter or by-laws of the separate vehicle.
The contractual arrangement sets out the terms upon which the parties participate in the activity that is the subject of the arrangement.
The contractual arrangement generally deals with such matters as
the purpose, activity and duration of the joint arrangement.
The decision-making process reflected in the contractual arrangement establishes joint control of the arrangement (see paragraphs B5–B11).
the capital or other contributions required of the parties.
how the parties share assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses or profit or loss relating to the joint arrangement.
When all the parties, or a group of the parties, considered collectively, are able to direct the activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement (ie the relevant activities), the parties control the arrangement collectively.
After concluding that all the parties, or a group of the parties, control the arrangement collectively, an entity shall assess whether it has joint control of the arrangement.
Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that collectively control the arrangement.
Sometimes the decision-making process that is agreed upon by the parties in their contractual arrangement implicitly leads to joint control.
In this case, the parties have implicitly agreed that they have joint control of the arrangement because decisions about the relevant activities cannot be made without both parties agreeing.
In other circumstances, the contractual arrangement requires a minimum proportion of the voting rights to make decisions about the relevant activities.
Even though A can block any decision, it does not control the arrangement because it needs the agreement of either B or C. In this example, A, B and C collectively control the arrangement.
In such a situation, to be a joint arrangement the contractual arrangement between the parties would need to specify which combination of the parties is required to agree unanimously to decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement.
Decisions about the relevant activities require approval by a majority of the voting rights.
A and B have joint control of the arrangement only if the contractual arrangement specifies that decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement require both A and B agreeing.
The requirement for unanimous consent means that any party with joint control of the arrangement can prevent any of the other parties, or a group of the parties, from making unilateral decisions (about the relevant activities) without its consent.
If the requirement for unanimous consent relates only to decisions that give a party protective rights and not to decisions about the relevant activities of an arrangement, that party is not a party with joint control of the arrangement.
A contractual arrangement might include clauses on the resolution of disputes, such as arbitration.
These provisions may allow for decisions to be made in the absence of unanimous consent among the parties that have joint control.
The existence of such provisions does not prevent the arrangement from being jointly controlled and, consequently, from being a joint arrangement.
Joint arrangements are established for a variety of purposes (eg as a way for parties to share costs and risks, or as a way to provide the parties with access to new technology or new markets), and can be established using different structures and legal forms.
Some arrangements do not require the activity that is the subject of the arrangement to be undertaken in a separate vehicle.
However, other arrangements involve the establishment of a separate vehicle.
The classification of joint arrangements required by this IFRS depends upon the parties' rights and obligations arising from the arrangement in the normal course of business.
This IFRS classifies joint arrangements as either joint operations or joint ventures.
When an entity has rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint operation.
When an entity has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint venture.
Paragraphs B16–B33 set out the assessment an entity carries out to determine whether it has an interest in a joint operation or an interest in a joint venture.
As stated in paragraph B14, the classification of joint arrangements requires the parties to assess their rights and obligations arising from the arrangement.
When making that assessment, an entity shall consider the following
the structure of the joint arrangement (see paragraphs B16–B21).
when the joint arrangement is structured through a separate vehicle
the legal form of the separate vehicle (see paragraphs B22–B24);
(iii) when relevant, other facts and circumstances (see paragraphs B29–B33).
Joint arrangements not structured through a separate vehicle
A joint arrangement that is not structured through a separate vehicle is a joint operation.
In such cases, the contractual arrangement establishes the parties' rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement, and the parties' rights to the corresponding revenues and obligations for the corresponding expenses.
The contractual arrangement often describes the nature of the activities that are the subject of the arrangement and how the parties intend to undertake those activities together.
For example, the parties to a joint arrangement could agree to manufacture a product together, with each party being responsible for a specific task and each using its own assets and incurring its own liabilities.
The contractual arrangement could also specify how the revenues and expenses that are common to the parties are to be shared among them.
In such a case, each joint operator recognises in its financial statements the assets and liabilities used for the specific task, and recognises its share of the revenues and expenses in accordance with the contractual arrangement.
In other cases, the parties to a joint arrangement might agree, for example, to share and operate an asset together.
In such a case, the contractual arrangement establishes the parties' rights to the asset that is operated jointly, and how output or revenue from the asset and operating costs are shared among the parties.
Each joint operator accounts for its share of the joint asset and its agreed share of any liabilities, and recognises its share of the output, revenues and expenses in accordance with the contractual arrangement.
Joint arrangements structured through a separate vehicle
A joint arrangement in which the assets and liabilities relating to the arrangement are held in a separate vehicle can be either a joint venture or a joint operation.
Whether a party is a joint operator or a joint venturer depends on the party's rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement that are held in the separate vehicle.
As stated in paragraph B15, when the parties have structured a joint arrangement in a separate vehicle, the parties need to assess whether the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, any other facts and circumstances give them
rights to the net assets of the arrangement (ie the arrangement is a joint venture).
The legal form of the separate vehicle
The legal form of the separate vehicle is relevant when assessing the type of joint arrangement.
For example, the parties might conduct the joint arrangement through a separate vehicle, whose legal form causes the separate vehicle to be considered in its own right (ie the assets and liabilities held in the separate vehicle are the assets and liabilities of the separate vehicle and not the assets and liabilities of the parties).
In such a case, the assessment of the rights and obligations conferred upon the parties by the legal form of the separate vehicle indicates that the arrangement is a joint venture.
The assessment of the rights and obligations conferred upon the parties by the legal form of the separate vehicle is sufficient to conclude that the arrangement is a joint operation only if the parties conduct the joint arrangement in a separate vehicle whose legal form does not confer separation between the parties and the separate vehicle (ie the assets and liabilities held in the separate vehicle are the parties' assets and liabilities).
Assessing the terms of the contractual arrangement
In many cases, the rights and obligations agreed to by the parties in their contractual arrangements are consistent, or do not conflict, with the rights and obligations conferred on the parties by the legal form of the separate vehicle in which the arrangement has been structured.
In other cases, the parties use the contractual arrangement to reverse or modify the rights and obligations conferred by the legal form of the separate vehicle in which the arrangement has been structured.
In such a case, the assessment of the rights and obligations conferred upon the parties by the legal form of the separate vehicle indicates that the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
However, the parties modify the features of the corporation through their contractual arrangement so that each has an interest in the assets of the incorporated entity and each is liable for the liabilities of the incorporated entity in a specified proportion.
Such contractual modifications to the features of a corporation can cause an arrangement to be a joint operation.
The following table compares common terms in contractual arrangements of parties to a joint operation and common terms in contractual arrangements of parties to a joint venture.
The examples of the contractual terms provided in the following table are not exhaustive.
The contractual arrangement provides the parties to the joint arrangement with rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
The contractual arrangement provides the parties to the joint arrangement with rights to the net assets of the arrangement (ie it is the separate vehicle, not the parties, that has rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement).
The contractual arrangement establishes that the assets brought into the arrangement or subsequently acquired by the joint arrangement are the arrangement's assets.
The parties have no interests (ie no rights, title or ownership) in the assets of the arrangement.
The contractual arrangement establishes that the joint arrangement is liable for the debts and obligations of the arrangement.
The contractual arrangement establishes that the parties to the joint arrangement are liable to the arrangement only to the extent of their respective investments in the arrangement or to their respective obligations to contribute any unpaid or additional capital to the arrangement, or both.
The contractual arrangement states that creditors of the joint arrangement do not have rights of recourse against any party with respect to debts or obligations of the arrangement.
The contractual arrangement establishes the allocation of revenues and expenses on the basis of the relative performance of each party to the joint arrangement.
For example, the contractual arrangement might establish that revenues and expenses are allocated on the basis of the capacity that each party uses in a plant operated jointly, which could differ from their ownership interest in the joint arrangement.
In other instances, the parties might have agreed to share the profit or loss relating to the arrangement on the basis of a specified proportion such as the parties' ownership interest in the arrangement.
This would not prevent the arrangement from being a joint operation if the parties have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
The contractual arrangement establishes each party's share in the profit or loss relating to the activities of the arrangement.
The provision of such guarantees, or the commitment by the parties to provide them, does not, by itself, determine that the joint arrangement is a joint operation.
The feature that determines whether the joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture is whether the parties have obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement (for some of which the parties might or might not have provided a guarantee).
When the contractual arrangement specifies that the parties have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement, they are parties to a joint operation and do not need to consider other facts and circumstances (paragraphs B29–B33) for the purposes of classifying the joint arrangement.
Assessing other facts and circumstances
When the terms of the contractual arrangement do not specify that the parties have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement, the parties shall consider other facts and circumstances to assess whether the arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture.
A joint arrangement might be structured in a separate vehicle whose legal form confers separation between the parties and the separate vehicle.
The contractual terms agreed among the parties might not specify the parties' rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, yet consideration of other facts and circumstances can lead to such an arrangement being classified as a joint operation.
This will be the case when other facts and circumstances give the parties rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
When the activities of an arrangement are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties, this indicates that the parties have rights to substantially all the economic benefits of the assets of the arrangement.
The effect of an arrangement with such a design and purpose is that the liabilities incurred by the arrangement are, in substance, satisfied by the cash flows received from the parties through their purchases of the output.
When the parties are substantially the only source of cash flows contributing to the continuity of the operations of the arrangement, this indicates that the parties have an obligation for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.
The purpose of the arrangement is to manufacture materials required by the parties for their own, individual manufacturing processes.
The arrangement ensures that the parties operate the facility that produces the materials to the quantity and quality specifications of the parties.
However, the parties also consider the following aspects of the arrangement
From the fact pattern above, the following facts and circumstances are relevant
These facts and circumstances indicate that the arrangement is a joint operation.
In that scenario, such a change in the facts and circumstances would require reassessment of the classification of the joint arrangement.
Such facts and circumstances would indicate that the arrangement is a joint venture.
The following flow chart reflects the assessment an entity follows to classify an arrangement when the joint arrangement is structured through a separate vehicle
Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations
The principles on business combinations accounting that do not conflict with the guidance in this IFRS include but are not limited to
recognising the excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, if any, as goodwill; and
However, those paragraphs do not apply to the formation of a joint operation if all of the parties that participate in the joint operation only contribute assets or groups of assets that do not constitute businesses to the joint operation on its formation.
A joint operator might increase its interest in a joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business, as defined in IFRS 3, by acquiring an additional interest in the joint operation.
In such cases, previously held interests in the joint operation are not remeasured if the joint operator retains joint control.
In such cases, previously held interests in the joint operation are not remeasured.
Paragraphs 21A and B33A–B33C do not apply on the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation when the parties sharing joint control, including the entity acquiring the interest in the joint operation, are under the common control of the same ultimate controlling party or parties both before and after the acquisition, and that control is not transitory.
Accounting for sales or contributions of assets to a joint operation
When such transactions provide evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of the assets to be sold or contributed to the joint operation, or of an impairment loss of those assets, those losses shall be recognised fully by the joint operator.
When such transactions provide evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of the assets to be purchased or of an impairment loss of those assets, a joint operator shall recognise its share of those losses.
Effective date, transition and withdrawal of other IFRSs
If an entity applies those amendments in an earlier period it shall disclose that fact.
When changing from proportionate consolidation to the equity method, an entity shall recognise its investment in the joint venture as at the beginning of the immediately preceding period.
That initial investment shall be measured as the aggregate of the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities that the entity had previously proportionately consolidated, including any goodwill arising from acquisition.
The opening balance of the investment determined in accordance with paragraph C2 is regarded as the deemed cost of the investment at initial recognition.
If aggregating all previously proportionately consolidated assets and liabilities results in negative net assets, an entity shall assess whether it has legal or constructive obligations in relation to the negative net assets and, if so, the entity shall recognise the corresponding liability.
If the entity concludes that it does not have legal or constructive obligations in relation to the negative net assets, it shall not recognise the corresponding liability but it shall adjust retained earnings at the beginning of the immediately preceding period.
The entity shall disclose this fact, along with its cumulative unrecognised share of losses of its joint ventures as at the beginning of the immediately preceding period and at the date at which this IFRS is first applied.
An entity shall disclose a breakdown of the assets and liabilities that have been aggregated into the single line investment balance as at the beginning of the immediately preceding period.
That disclosure shall be prepared in an aggregated manner for all joint ventures for which an entity applies the transition requirements referred to in paragraphs C2–C6.
An entity shall determine its interest in the assets and liabilities relating to the joint operation on the basis of its rights and obligations in a specified proportion in accordance with the contractual arrangement.
An entity measures the initial carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities by disaggregating them from the carrying amount of the investment at the beginning of the immediately preceding period on the basis of the information used by the entity in applying the equity method.
An entity changing from the equity method to accounting for assets and liabilities shall provide a reconciliation between the investment derecognised, and the assets and liabilities recognised, together with any remaining difference adjusted against retained earnings, at the beginning of the immediately preceding period.
Transition provisions in an entity's separate financial statements
derecognise the investment and recognise the assets and the liabilities in respect of its interest in the joint operation at the amounts determined in accordance with paragraphs C7–C9.
provide a reconciliation between the investment derecognised, and the assets and liabilities recognised, together with any remaining difference adjusted in retained earnings, at the beginning of the immediately preceding period.
References to the 'immediately preceding period
Notwithstanding the references to the 'immediately preceding period' in paragraphs C2–C12, an entity may also present adjusted comparative information for any earlier periods presented, but is not required to do so.
If an entity does present adjusted comparative information for any earlier periods, all references to the 'immediately preceding period' in paragraphs C2–C12 shall be read as the 'earliest adjusted comparative period presented'.
Consequently, amounts recognised for acquisitions of interests in joint operations occurring in prior periods shall not be adjusted.

DISCLOSURES RELATING TO TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
Amendments to Basis for Conclusions on other IFRSs
The text of this Basis for Conclusions has been amended for consistency with those changes.
Also, fundamental changes were taking place in the financial services industry and in the way in which financial institutions manage their activities and risk exposures.
This made it increasingly difficult for users of banks' financial statements to assess and compare their financial position and performance, their associated risk exposures, and their processes for measuring and managing those risks.
FAAC members had experience and expertise in banks, finance companies and insurance companies and included auditors, financial analysts, preparers and regulators.
to provide input from the perspective of preparers and auditors of financial statements of entities that have significant exposures to financial instruments; and
to assist the Board in developing a standard and implementation guidance for risk disclosures arising from financial instruments and for other related disclosures.
The aim of the proposed amendments was to enhance disclosures about fair value and liquidity risk.
This was in response to requests from users of financial statements and recommendations from the Financial Stability Board to achieve convergence of the boards' requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities.
The different requirements result in a significant difference between amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRSs and amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with US GAAP, particularly for entities that have large amounts of derivative activities.
The proposals in the exposure draft would have replaced the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities and would have established a common approach with the FASB.
After considering the responses to the exposure draft, the boards decided to maintain their respective offsetting models.
However, to meet the needs of users of financial statements, the boards agreed jointly on additional disclosures to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements, including rights of set-off associated with an entity's recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities, on the entity's financial position.
The Board observed that the reduction in regulatory barriers in many countries and increasing competition between banks, non-bank financial services firms, and financial conglomerates have resulted in many entities providing financial services that were traditionally provided only by entities regulated and supervised as banks.
The Board concluded that this development would make it inappropriate to limit this project to banks and similar financial institutions.
The Board considered whether entities that undertake specified activities commonly undertaken by banks and other financial institutions, namely deposit-taking, lending and securities activities, face unique risks that would require a standard specific to them.
However, the Board decided that the scope of this project should include disclosures about risks arising from financial instruments in all entities for the following reasons
In particular, it could not satisfactorily differentiate an entity with securities activities from an entity holding a portfolio of financial assets for investment and liquidity management purposes.
Hence, the disclosure principles that apply to regulated entities should not differ from those that apply to non-regulated, but otherwise similar, entities.
This is because equity instruments are not remeasured and hence
they do not expose the issuer to balance sheet and income statement risk; and
the disclosures about the significance of financial instruments for financial position and performance are not relevant to equity instruments.
The Board considered whether the IFRS should apply to entities that both have financial instruments and issue insurance contracts.
The Board did not exempt these entities because financial instruments expose all entities to risks regardless of what other assets and liabilities they have.
The Board considered whether it should exempt small and medium-sized entities from the scope of the IFRS.
The Board noted that the extent of disclosures required by the IFRS will depend on the extent to which the entity uses financial instruments and the extent to which it has assumed associated risks.
The IFRS requires entities with few financial instruments and few risks to give few disclosures.
Also, many of the requirements in the IFRS are based on information provided internally to the entity's key management personnel.
This helps to avoid unduly onerous requirements that would not be appropriate for smaller entities.
However, it will keep this decision under review in its project on financial reporting for small and medium-sized entities.
However, deciding whether such an entity should prepare general purpose financial statements is a matter for the entity and local legislators and regulators.
If such an entity prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, users of those statements should receive information of the same quality as users of any general purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs.
The Board confirmed its view that no exemptions from the general requirements of any Standard should be given for the financial statements of subsidiaries.
The Board also decided to specify disclosures to satisfy this principle.
Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities (paragraph 8)
The Board concluded that disclosures for each measurement category would assist users in understanding the extent to which accounting policies affect the amounts at which financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised.
The Board also concluded that separate disclosure of the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities that are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and those mandatorily measured at fair value is useful because such designation is at the discretion of the entity.
Paragraph 10(a) requires disclosure of the change in fair value of a financial liability designated as at fair value through profit or loss that is attributable to changes in the liability's credit risk.
Although quantifying such changes might be difficult in practice, the Board concluded that disclosure of such information would be useful to users of financial statements and would help alleviate concerns that users may misinterpret the profit or loss effects of changes in credit risk, especially in the absence of disclosures.
The Board believed that this is often a reasonable proxy for the change in fair value that is attributable to changes in the liability's credit risk, in particular when such changes are large, and would provide users with information with which to understand the profit or loss effect of such a change in credit risk.
In particular, there could be other factors involved in the change in an instrument's fair value unrelated to the benchmark interest rate, such as the effect of an embedded derivative.
Respondents also cited difficulties for unit-linked insurance contracts, for which the amount of the liability reflects the performance of a defined pool of assets.
However, the Board acknowledged and shared these concerns.
As a result, the Board amended this requirement to focus directly on the objective of providing information about the effects of changes in credit risk
by permitting entities to provide a more faithful representation of the amount of change in fair value that is attributable to changes in credit risk if they could do so.
However, such entities are also required to disclose the methods used and provide their justification for concluding that those methods give a more faithful representation than the proxy in paragraph 10(a)(i).
by amending the proxy disclosure to be the amount of change in fair value that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk.
For example, some entities may be able to identify part of the change in the fair value of the liability as attributable to a change in an index.
In these cases, the proxy disclosure would exclude the amount of change attributable to a change in an index.
Similarly, excluding the amount attributable to a change in an internal or external investment fund makes the proxy more suitable for unit-linked insurance contracts.
The Board decided that when an entity has designated a financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss, it should disclose the difference between the carrying amount and the amount the entity would contractually be required to pay at maturity to the holders of the liability (see paragraph 10(b)).
The fair value may differ significantly from the settlement amount, in particular for financial liabilities with a long duration when an entity has experienced a significant deterioration in creditworthiness since their issue.
The Board concluded that knowledge of this difference would be useful to users of financial statements.
Also, the settlement amount is important to some financial statement users, particularly creditors.
The Board extended this requirement to include disclosure of the reason for reclassifications and of the amount reclassified into and out of each category.
As noted in paragraph BC14, the Board regards such information as useful because the categorisation of financial instruments has a significant effect on their measurement.
The Board decided to require additional disclosures about the situations in which any such reclassification is made, and the effects on the financial statements.
The Board regards such information as useful because the reclassification of a financial asset can have a significant effect on the financial statements.
The exposure draft proposed common offsetting requirements for IFRSs and US GAAP and proposed disclosures about financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to rights of set-off and related arrangements.
BC24C Most respondents to the exposure draft supported the boards' efforts towards achieving convergence, but their responses to the proposals varied.
Some US GAAP preparers indicated that offsetting in the statement of financial position in accordance with the proposed criteria provided more relevant information than the current model, except for derivatives and repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements.
BC24D There was no consensus among users of financial statements regarding if, or when, to present gross or net information in the statement of financial position.
However, there was consensus that both gross and net information are useful and necessary for analysing financial statements.
Users of financial statements supported achieving convergence of the IFRS and US GAAP requirements, and also supported improving disclosures so that financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs and US GAAP would be more comparable.
Comparable information is important to investors for calculating their ratios and performing their analyses.
However, the boards noted that requiring common disclosures of gross and net amounts of recognised financial instruments that are (a) set off in the statement of financial position and (b) subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements, even if not set off in the statement of financial position, would be helpful for users of financial statements.
Accordingly, the boards agreed on common disclosure requirements by amending and finalising the disclosures initially proposed in the exposure draft.
BC24F The disclosures in the exposure draft would have applied to all recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities subject to a right of set-off, and/or for which an entity had either received or pledged cash or other financial instruments as collateral.
US GAAP has similar disclosure requirements.
Consequently, if an entity has no financial assets or financial liabilities subject to a right of set-off (other than collateral agreements or credit enhancements), the boards concluded that there would be no incremental value in providing additional disclosure information for such instruments.
BC24H For example, some respondents were concerned that providing disclosure of conditional rights to set off loans and customer deposits at the same financial institution would be a significant operational burden.
Such rights are often a result of statute, and entities do not typically manage their credit risk related to such amounts based on these rights of set-off.
In addition, entities that have contractual rights to set off customer deposits with loans only in situations such as events of default see these rights as a credit enhancement and not as the primary source of credit mitigation.
Respondents argued that the cost of including these amounts in the amended disclosures would outweigh the benefit because users of financial statements did not request information related to these instruments when discussing the offsetting disclosure requirements.
The boards agreed and decided to limit the scope of the disclosures to all financial instruments that meet the boards' respective offsetting models and recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or a similar agreement.
This reduced scope still responds to the needs of users of financial statements for information about amounts that have been set off in accordance with IFRSs and amounts that have been set off in accordance with US GAAP.
The types of instruments that fall within the scope of these disclosures include the instruments that cause significant differences between amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRSs and amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
If there is an associated collateral agreement for such instruments, an entity would disclose amounts subject to such agreements in order to provide full information about its exposure in the normal course of business, as well as in the events of default and insolvency or bankruptcy.
Although non-financial collateral agreements may exist for some financial instruments, those preparers do not necessarily manage the credit risk related to such financial instruments on the basis of the non-financial collateral held.
BC24L The disclosures focus on the effects of recognised financial instruments and financial instrument set-off agreements on an entity's financial position.
The boards also noted that a comprehensive reconsideration of credit risk disclosures was not within the scope of this project.
They therefore restricted the scope of the disclosures to exclude financial instruments with rights of set-off only for non-financial collateral.
They questioned the benefit that such disclosures would provide to investors in non-financial entities.
BC24N Although the boards acknowledged that financial institutions would be among those most affected, they did not agree that the disclosures are only relevant for financial institutions.
Other industries have similar financial instrument activities and use enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements to mitigate exposure to credit risks.
Consequently, the boards concluded that the required disclosures provide useful information about an entity's arrangements, irrespective of the nature of the entity's business.
For example, a payable related to a repurchase agreement may be measured at amortised cost, while a derivative asset or derivative liability subject to the same disclosure requirements (for example, in paragraph 13C(a) of IFRS 7) will be measured at fair value.
Consequently, a financial asset or financial liability disclosure table may include financial instruments measured at different amounts.
To provide users of financial statements with the information they need to evaluate the amounts disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C of IFRS 7, the boards decided that an entity should describe any resulting measurement differences in the related disclosures.
BC24P When providing feedback on the proposals in the exposure draft, users of financial statements emphasised that information in the notes should be clearly reconciled back to the amounts in the statement of financial position.
This may include current rights of set-off that do not meet the criterion in paragraph 42(b) of IAS 32, or conditional rights of set-off that are enforceable and exercisable only in the event of default, or only in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of any of the counterparties.
Depending on the terms of the collateral arrangement, collateral will often reduce an entity's exposure in the events of default and insolvency or bankruptcy of a counterparty to the contract.
Collateral received or pledged against financial assets and financial liabilities may often be liquidated immediately upon an event of default.
At no point in time should under-collateralisation be obscured.
BC24T The exposure draft proposed disclosures by class of financial instrument.
An entity would have been required to group financial assets and financial liabilities separately into classes that were appropriate to the nature of the information disclosed, taking into account the characteristics of those financial instruments and the applicable rights of set-off.
They also indicated that they often manage credit exposure by counterparty and not necessarily by class of financial instrument.
BC24U Many users of financial statements indicated that disclosure of recognised amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements (including financial collateral) that were not set off in the statement of financial position would be useful irrespective of whether the amounts are disclosed by counterparty or by type or by class of financial instrument, as long as they can reconcile these amounts back to the statement of financial position.
In evaluating whether the disclosures should be provided by type or by class of financial instrument or by counterparty, the boards noted that the objective of these disclosures (paragraph 13B of IFRS 7) is that an entity should disclose information to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on the entity's financial position.
Disclosure by type of financial instrument may (or may not) differ from the class of financial instrument used for other disclosures in IFRS 7, but is appropriate in circumstances where a difference would better achieve the objective of the disclosures required by these amendments.
This would allow preparers to present the disclosures in the same way that they manage their credit exposure.
Consequently, the Board noted that, irrespective of whether the disclosures were required to be provided by type or by class of financial instrument or by counterparty, entities are already required to disclose information about risks and how they are managed, including information about concentrations of credit risk.
Reconciliation between IFRSs and US GAAP
BC24X Some users of financial statements asked for information to help them reconcile between the amounts set off in accordance with IFRSs and the amounts set off in accordance with US GAAP.
These amounts are important for users of financial statements to understand the effects of netting arrangements on an entity's financial position in the normal course of business and in the events of default and insolvency or bankruptcy.
BC24Y Consequently, while the amended disclosure requirements do not directly reconcile the IFRS and US GAAP amounts, they provide both gross and net information on a comparable basis.
The boards considered that requiring a full reconciliation between IFRSs and US GAAP was unnecessary, particularly given the relative costs and benefits.
The boards believe that a tabular format best conveys an overall understanding of the effect of any rights of set-off and other related arrangements on an entity's financial position and improves the transparency of such information.
The boards did not believe that this was the case with the proposed disclosure requirements.
Retrospective transition would enable analysis and understanding of comparative accounting information among entities.
In addition, the scope of the disclosures was reduced and the disclosures amended to require less detailed information than originally proposed, which would make them less burdensome for preparers to apply retrospectively.
The boards indicated that they would use such feedback, as well as the responses in their Request for Views on Effective Dates and Transition Methods, and the timing of other planned accounting and reporting standards, to determine an appropriate effective date for the proposals in the exposure draft.
If an earlier date was required, it was suggested that application should be restricted only to the accounting period being presented, rather than providing comparative information, because of the potential burden of applying the proposed disclosure requirements.
Aligning the effective date of these amendments with the effective date of the financial instruments project could result in postponing the effective date of the common disclosure requirements, which would mean a delay in providing users of financial statements the information that they need.
BC24AJ Before issuing an IFRS or an amendment to an IFRS, the Board seeks to ensure that it will meet a significant need and that the overall benefits of the resulting information justify the costs of providing it.
The disclosures address a significant difference between the amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRSs and amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with US GAAP, particularly for entities that have large amounts of derivative activities.
The disclosures therefore make the amounts presented in accordance with both sets of standards more comparable.
BC24AK During redeliberations, the Board considered feedback related to the costs of providing the disclosures proposed in the exposure draft.
As described in greater detail in other sections of this Basis for Conclusions, the Board decided to limit the scope of the disclosures because these changes would reduce the cost to preparers while still providing the information that users of financial statements had requested.
However, the Board concluded that it is reasonable to expect an entity to know the fair value of collateral that it holds and can sell even if there is no default.
Allowance account for credit losses (paragraph 16)
The Board decided not to add this disclosure in finalising the IFRS.
The accounting policy disclosures required by paragraph B5(d) also include information about the use of direct adjustments to carrying amounts of financial assets.
The Board notes that this is more complicated for compound financial instruments with multiple embedded derivative features whose values are interdependent (for example, a convertible debt instrument that gives the issuer a right to call the instrument back from the holder, or the holder a right to put the instrument back to the issuer) than for those without such features.
If the embedded equity and non-equity derivative features are interdependent, the sum of the separately determined values of the liability and equity components will not equal the value of the compound financial instrument as a whole.
For example, the values of an embedded call option feature and an equity conversion option feature in a callable convertible debt instrument depend in part on each other if the holder's equity conversion option is extinguished when the entity exercises the call option or vice versa.
The following diagram illustrates the joint value arising from the interaction between a call option and an equity conversion option in a callable convertible bond.
Circle L represents the value of the liability component, ie the value of the straight debt and the embedded call option on the straight debt, and Circle E represents the value of the equity component, ie the equity conversion option on the straight debt.
The difference between the value of the callable convertible bond as a whole and the sum of the separately determined values for the liability and equity components is the joint value attributable to the interdependence between the call option feature and the equity conversion feature.
Under the approach in IAS 32, the joint value attributable to the interdependence between multiple embedded derivative features is included in the liability component.
Even though this approach is consistent with the definition of equity as a residual interest, the Board recognises that the allocation of the joint value to either the liability component or the equity component is arbitrary because it is, by its nature, joint.
Therefore, the Board concluded that it is important to disclose the existence of issued compound financial instruments with multiple embedded derivative features that have interdependent values.
Such disclosure highlights the effect of multiple embedded derivative features on the amounts recognised as liabilities and equity.
The Board concluded that such disclosures provide relevant information about the entity's creditworthiness and its prospects of obtaining future loans.
Items of income, expenses, gains or losses (paragraph 20(a))
Some entities include interest and dividend income in gains and losses on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss and others do not.
To assist users in comparing income arising from financial instruments across different entities, the Board decided that an entity should disclose how the income statement amounts are determined.
For example, an entity should disclose whether net gains and losses on financial assets or financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss include interest and dividend income (see Appendix B, paragraph B5(e)).
Fee income and expense (paragraph 20(c))
Paragraph 20(c) requires disclosure of fee income and expense (other than amounts included in determining the effective interest rate) arising from financial assets or financial liabilities and from trust and other fiduciary activities that result in the entity holding or placing assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans, and other institutions.
This information indicates the level of such activities and helps users to estimate possible future income of the entity.
BC35B During its deliberations, the Board engaged in outreach activities with users of financial statements.
This outreach included soliciting views on presentation and disclosures.
The Board used the responses received from those outreach activities to develop the proposed hedge accounting disclosures.
BC35C The Board was told that many users did not find the hedge accounting disclosures in financial statements helpful.
BC35D To provide relevant information that enhances the transparency on an entity's hedging activities, the Board proposes hedge accounting disclosures that meet particular objectives.
Clear disclosure objectives allow an entity to apply its judgement when it provides information that is useful and relevant to users of financial statements.
BC35E The following sub-sections set out the Board's considerations regarding the proposed hedge accounting disclosures.
Scope of the hedge accounting disclosures
BC35F An entity might enter into a transaction to manage an exposure to a particular risk that might not qualify for hedge accounting (for various reasons), for example, an item that is not eligible to be designated as a hedged item or hedging instrument.
Information on such transactions might enable users to understand why an entity has entered into a transaction and how it manages the particular risk, even though those transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The Board did not believe that this would be feasible as part of its hedge accounting project as it requires a much wider scope because the disclosures would not depend on the accounting treatment.
BC35H Furthermore, users of financial statements can often obtain information on an entity's hedging activities from information in management reports and sources outside the financial reporting context.
That often gives a reasonable overview of why hedge accounting might be difficult to achieve.
However, some did raise concerns about the potential lack of information that will be available to users of financial statements about those risk exposures an entity hedges but for which hedge accounting is not applied.
The Board believes that, as part of these disclosures, entities would provide information for users of financial statements to understand how it manages risk exposures for which hedge accounting is not applied.
Hence, the Board considered that the transparency of an entity's hedging activities could be enhanced by an approach that considers
information that provides a clear picture of those risk management activities of an entity that are captured by hedge accounting (this information is not necessarily provided in the primary financial statements); and
information that is included in the primary financial statements.
BC35N To provide information that is useful to users of financial statements, there should be a clear link between the hedge accounting information that is outside the primary financial statements and the hedge accounting within those.
To provide such a link, the Board decided that an entity should provide hedge accounting disclosures by risk category.
Consequently, an entity should disclose by risk category
information that is not included in the primary financial statements (see paragraphs BC35P–BC35BB); and
information that is included in the primary financial statements (see paragraphs BC35CC–BC35SS).
BC35O The Board decided not to prescribe the risk categories by which the disclosures need to be disaggregated.
In the Board's view an entity should apply judgement and categorise risks on the basis of how it manages its risks through hedging.
For example, an entity manages its floating interest rate risk using interest rate swaps (to change it to a fixed interest rate) for some hedging relationships (cash flow hedges), while it also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage both the floating interest rate and foreign exchange risk of other hedging relationships (cash flow hedges).
However, an entity should apply its risk categories consistently throughout all the proposed hedge accounting disclosures.
Understanding an entity's risk management strategy for each risk helps users to understand the accounting information disclosed.
BC35S The Board noted that an entity will identify and ultimately describe their risk management strategies based on how it manages risk.
Because entities manage risk in different ways, the Board did not think that users of financial statements would necessarily understand an entity's risk management strategy if it required a specific list of information to be disclosed.
Instead, the Board decided to add additional guidance on the type of information that should be included in a risk management description.
In this context, risk exposure refers only to risks that the entity has decided to hedge and for which hedge accounting is applied.
quantitative information on the risk exposure that the entity manages and the extent to which the entity hedges that exposure; and
a breakdown of that information for each future period that a hedging relationship (which exists at the reporting date) covers.
BC35V The Board also proposed that an entity should disclose information about the sources of hedge ineffectiveness of hedging relationships for each particular risk category.
In the Board's view this would assist users in identifying the reasons for hedge ineffectiveness that is recognised in profit or loss.
It would also help users to determine how hedging relationships will affect profit or loss.
They commented that this would result in the disclosure of commercially sensitive information (ie the risk exposure and the hedged rate).
They believed that those who do not elect to apply hedge accounting would potentially have an unfair advantage because although they do not have to disclose anything, they could nonetheless gain insight into their competitor's hedge positions.
Commercial sensitivity was also of concern to those entities whose competitors are not listed companies or who do not report under IFRSs.
Consequently, it would result in disclosures about forward looking information and the rates at which future transactions are hedged.
Consequently, the Board decided not to require information to be disclosed about the total risk exposure because of the potential forward looking nature of this information.
The Board also decided to change the focus of the proposed disclosure from the hedged item to the hedging instrument.
In other words, the disclosure would require information on some of the terms and conditions of the hedging instrument to be provided.
The Board believes that this information will still be relevant and useful for users of financial statements in inferring the exposure that an entity is exposed to and what the effects will be on future cash flows as a result of how the entity manages the particular risk.
This is particularly the case for hedges of open portfolios.
The Board noted that, because the general hedge accounting model allows hedge accounting for hedges of groups and net positions in relation to closed portfolios, entities need to use a 'dynamic' hedging process for an open portfolio.
This means that entities designate hedging relationships for an open portfolio as if it were a closed portfolio for a short period and at the end of that period look at the open portfolio as the next closed portfolio for another short period.
The dynamic nature of this process involves frequent discontinuations and restarts of hedging relationships.
BC35Z The Board considered that, in those circumstances, providing information about the terms and conditions of the hedging instruments would not be useful given that the hedging instruments are part of a particular hedging relationship for only a short period at a time and are then designated into a new hedging relationship or left undesignated.
In contrast, the disclosure requirement related to the terms and conditions of the hedging instrument was designed to provide information for situations in which an entity hedges a risk that remains broadly the same over the entire hedged period.
Consequently, the Board decided to exempt entities from the requirement to disclose the terms and conditions of the hedging instruments in situations in which they use a 'dynamic' hedging process that involves frequent discontinuations and restarts of hedging relationships.
Consequently, the Board decided that, in such circumstances, an entity should expand its discussion of the risk management strategy by providing the following information about how the entity uses hedge accounting to reflect its risk management strategy
information about what the ultimate risk management strategy is (for the dynamic hedging process);
a description of how it reflects its risk management strategy by using hedge accounting and designating the particular hedging relationships; and
an indication of how frequently the hedging relationships are discontinued and restarted as part of the dynamic hedging process.
BC35BB The Board also noted that, because the designated hedging relationships change frequently, the specific relationships at the reporting date might not be representative of the normal volumes during the period.
Hedge accounting disclosures should therefore increase the transparency of how an entity has mitigated these recognition and measurement anomalies.
Doing so will help users identify how hedge accounting has affected the entity's statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and statement of financial position.
BC35DD To provide information on the effects of hedge accounting on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position, the Board proposed disclosures that should be presented in a tabular format that separates the information by risk category and by type of hedge.
Providing disclosures in a tabular format allows users to identify clearly the relevant numbers and their effects on the entity's statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and statement of financial position.
BC35EE During the Board's initial outreach, users said that they do not analyse an entity's hedging activities by type of hedging relationship (for example, a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge).
They said that it is more important to understand the risks that the entity manages and the results after hedging.
However, to provide information effectively on the effects of hedge accounting on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position, the information should reflect the accounting that was applied (for example, cash flow hedge accounting or fair value hedge accounting).
The Board believed that if the proposed table is prepared by risk category and by type of hedge, the table would provide sufficient links between the accounting information and the risk management information.
BC35FF The Board did not propose prescribing levels of aggregation or disaggregation for the information that should be disclosed in a tabular format.
An entity should apply judgement when it determines the appropriate level of aggregation or disaggregation.
For example, users should be able to take amounts that are disclosed and measured at fair value and make comparisons between the fair value disclosures and the proposed hedge accounting disclosures.
The deferred amounts are reflected in the statement of changes in equity in the cash flow hedge reserve.
The Board also proposed that the reconciliation should be by type of risk.
The Board considered that such a disclosure would allow users of financial statements to evaluate the effects of hedge accounting on equity and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
However, some respondents raised concerns that the proposal seems too prescriptive.
Some also commented that they did not think that the tabular disclosure, as proposed, provided a clear enough link between hedged items and hedging instruments for the purpose of explaining hedge ineffectiveness.
A few respondents also commented that the disclosures did not allow them to differentiate between financial instruments that have been designated as hedging instruments and those that have not.
These respondents believe that it is helpful to understand the purpose and effect of financial instruments if their designation is made clear through disclosures.
BC35II The Board thinks that providing a tabular disclosure format separated by type of hedge (ie fair value hedges or cash flow hedge), risk category and by risk management strategy provides a sufficient link between the accounting information and the risk management information.
BC35JJ The Board did not propose any more specific format other than requiring information to be disclosed in a tabular format.
The Board thought that entities should have the freedom to present the disclosures that require a tabular format however they feel is best in order to provide users with the most useful information.
The Board decided to require disclosure of the change in fair value of the hedging instruments and the change in the value of the hedged items on the basis that is used to calculate the hedge ineffectiveness that is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Those are the changes in value during the period (after taking into account the effect of the 'lower of' test for cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation).
This means that the difference between the amount included in the table for hedged items and the amount included in the table for hedging instruments equals the hedge ineffectiveness recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The Board thought that such a disclosure would provide potentially misleading information to users of financial statements.
This is because users of financial statements might think that all financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments might be held for speculative purposes.
This is not necessarily the case.
Entities might hold financial instruments for hedging purposes but may decide not to elect hedge accounting.
In addition to this, the Board thought that, because entities need to provide the information that requires a tabular format based on the same level of aggregation or disaggregation as in IFRS 13, users of financial statements should be able to identify the financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments by simply comparing the disclosures with each other.
Consequently, the Board also considered disclosures regarding the amounts that would be recognised in other comprehensive income under these proposals.
Consequently, as a result of IAS 1, an entity would disclose the amounts in relation to the time value of options that would be accumulated in other comprehensive income and the movements in that balance.
This disaggregation would provide additional information about what cumulative amount in other comprehensive income would become an expense item over time and what amount would be transferred when a particular transaction occurs.
However, as a consequence of the Board's decision to also allow an alternative accounting treatment for forward elements and foreign currency basis spreads, the Board also required that for the purpose of the IAS 1, amounts recognised in accumulated other comprehensive income that relate to forward elements and foreign currency basis spreads should be reconciled separately from amounts in relation to time value of options.
BC35RR For situations in which entities hedge credit risk using credit derivatives the Board decided to mitigate accounting mismatches in relation to credit derivatives accounted for at fair value through profit or loss by also using fair value through profit or loss accounting for the hedged credit exposure.
Consequently, the Board also considered disclosures to provide transparency when entities apply that accounting.
BC35SS The Board considered that the following information would be useful for understanding the accounting in such situations
a reconciliation of amounts at the beginning and end of the period for the nominal amount and for the fair value of the credit derivatives;
the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss as a result of changing the accounting for a credit exposure to fair value through profit or loss; and
when an entity discontinues fair value through profit or loss accounting for credit exposures, the fair value that becomes the new deemed cost or amortisable amount (for loan commitments) and the related nominal or principal amount.
The Board proposed that for some specifically identified disclosures, information be provided separately for hedging relationships to which the proposed exceptions apply.
However, respondents had mixed views on whether the proposed disclosure requirements struck the right balance between the expected benefits for users of financial statements and the expected cost for preparers.
As a result, these respondents suggested simplifying the proposed disclosure requirements.
Such information could be provided by requiring entities to disclose the nominal amounts of hedging instruments in hedging relationships in the scope of the amendments, supplemented with an explanation about how the entity is managing the process to transition to alternative benchmark rates.
These disclosures would help users of financial statements understand how an entity's hedging relationships are affected by the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform.
For example, the exceptions specify the assumptions to make about the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows.
Nevertheless, the Board observed that if an entity makes significant assumptions or judgements in applying the exceptions in those amendments (for example, to determine when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present), that would be useful information for the users of financial statements.
Accordingly, the Board decided to require entities to disclose information about any significant assumptions or judgements that the entity makes in applying the exceptions in the amendments.
That paragraph requires disclosure of the nominal amount of the hedging instruments in a hedging relationship directly affected by the uncertainties arising from the reform so that the information is disclosed on a gross basis rather than on a net basis (that is, offsetting hedging instruments in a liability position against those in an asset position).
This paragraph requires an entity, on the initial application of an IFRS (or amendments to an IFRS), to disclose, for the current period and each prior period presented, the amount of any adjustment for each financial statement line item affected.
This is because it would require an entity to maintain parallel systems in order to determine the amount of the adjustment for each financial statement line item affected.
To achieve this balance, the Board sought to develop disclosure requirements that would provide useful information to users of financial statements about the effects of the reform on an entity's financial instruments and risk management strategy without requiring disclosures for which the cost of providing that information would outweigh the benefits of the amendments.
However, respondents said that the requirement to provide this quantitative information based on the carrying amounts of the relevant non-derivative financial instruments may require an entity to make costly enhancements to its reporting systems and implement additional controls and reconciliations.
These users of financial statements said that quantitative information would still be useful even if an entity selected another representative basis on which to disclose it.
Quantitative information about financial assets and financial liabilities that—as at the end of the reporting period—reference interest rate benchmarks that are subject to the reform would therefore assist users of financial statements to assess an entity's progress towards implementing the reform.
The Board also considered that for this disclosure to be useful, the quantitative information about non-derivative financial assets, non-derivative financial liabilities and derivatives that continue to reference interest rate benchmarks subject to the reform should be provided in the context of the total non-derivative financial assets, total non-derivative financial liabilities and total derivatives as at the end of the reporting period.
BC35JJJ The Board agreed that an entity could still meet the underlying objective of this disclosure requirement by providing the relevant quantitative information in different ways.
Furthermore, the Board considered that permitting entities to select a basis on which to provide relevant quantitative information to achieve the disclosure objective would allow entities to leverage information that is already available and therefore would reduce the costs of providing the information.
This information would be disaggregated by significant interest rate benchmark.
For example, the quantitative information may be based on
the carrying amounts of non-derivative financial assets, the carrying amount of non-derivative financial liabilities and the nominal amount of derivatives;
the amounts related to recognised financial instruments (for example, the contractual par amount of non-derivative financial assets and non-derivative financial liabilities, and nominal amounts of derivatives); or
the amounts provided internally to key management personnel (as defined in IAS 24) of the entity about these financial instruments, for example, the entity's board of directors or chief executive officer.
Respondents often described the potential challenges in disclosing this information in a meaningful way by reference to multinational entities that are exposed to different alternative benchmark rates.
These respondents said that if the proposed disclosure was intended to confirm that the changes were economically equivalent, then the disclosure was unnecessary.
The fact that an entity has applied the practical expedient would automatically inform users of financial statements that the entity has assessed that the conditions for applying the practical expedient were met.
While some users of financial statements said the proposed disclosure could be useful for understanding the extent of changes to financial instruments to which the practical expedient is being applied, others were sceptical about whether entities would be able to disclose information in sufficient detail for it to be meaningful.
In particular, they highlighted the risk that the disclosures would be summarised at such an aggregated level that the information would not be useful.
Many entities use fair value information internally in determining their overall financial position and in making decisions about individual financial instruments.
It is also relevant to many decisions made by users of financial statements because, in many circumstances, it reflects the judgement of the financial markets about the present value of expected future cash flows relating to an instrument.
Fair value information permits comparisons of financial instruments having substantially the same economic characteristics, regardless of why they are held and when and by whom they were issued or acquired.
Fair values provide a neutral basis for assessing management's stewardship by indicating the effects of its decisions to buy, sell or hold financial assets and to incur, maintain or discharge financial liabilities.
The Board decided that when an entity does not measure a financial asset or financial liability in its balance sheet at fair value, it should provide fair value information through supplementary disclosures to assist users to compare entities on a consistent basis.
Accordingly, disclosure of fair value is not required for contracts containing a discretionary participation feature, if the fair value of that feature cannot be measured reliably.
For all other financial assets and financial liabilities, it is reasonable to expect that fair value can be determined with sufficient reliability within constraints of timeliness and cost.
Therefore, the Board concluded that there should be no other exception from the requirement to disclose fair value information for financial assets or financial liabilities.
However, the Board noted that a detailed quantitative disclosure of sensitivity to all assumptions is not required (only those that could result in a significantly different estimate of fair value are required) and that the disclosure does not require the entity to reflect interdependencies between assumptions when making the disclosure.
However, the Board noted that fair values estimated by valuation techniques are more subjective than those established from an observable market price, and concluded that users need information to help them assess the extent of this subjectivity.
That amendment does not specify how entities should account for those initial differences in subsequent periods.
The Board noted that the information required to provide these disclosures would be readily available to the entities affected.
financial instruments quoted in an active market;
financial instruments whose fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (ie without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets; and
financial instruments whose fair value is determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument (ie without modification or repackaging) and not based on available observable market data.
The Board was informed that users of financial statements value information about the risks arising from financial instruments, such as credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, to which entities are exposed, and the techniques used to identify, measure, monitor and control those risks.
Therefore, the Board decided to require disclosure of this information.
Entities with many financial instruments and related risks should provide more disclosure to communicate those risks to users of financial statements.
Conversely, entities with few financial instruments and related risks may provide less extensive disclosure.
The extent of disclosure depends on the extent of the entity's exposure to risks arising from financial instruments.
The guidance on implementing the IFRS illustrates how an entity might apply the IFRS.
The Board noted that because entities view and manage risk in different ways, disclosures based on how an entity manages risk are unlikely to be comparable between entities.
In addition, for an entity that undertakes limited management of risks arising from financial instruments, such disclosures would convey little or no information about the risks the entity has assumed.
To overcome these limitations, the Board decided to specify disclosures about risk exposures applicable to all entities.
These disclosures provide a common benchmark for financial statement users when comparing risk exposures across different entities and are expected to be relatively easy for entities to prepare.
Entities with more developed risk management systems would provide more detailed information.
The Board emphasised the interaction between qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments.
This enables users to link related disclosures and hence form an overall picture of the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments.
The Board concluded that an explicit emphasis on the interaction between qualitative and quantitative disclosures will contribute to disclosure of information in a way that better enables users to evaluate an entity's exposure.
Thus, the information does not meet the criteria of comparability, faithful representation and completeness.
Having this information in the financial statements would put IFRS preparers at a disadvantage relative to their US peers.
Respondents raised concerns that the disclosure of sensitivity analysis in particular should not be part of the financial statements.
Respondents stated that sensitivity analysis cannot be prepared with the degree of reliability expected of information in the financial statements, and that the subjectivity in the sensitivity analysis and the hypothetical alternative values could undermine the credibility of the fair values recognised in the financial statements.
The Board considered whether the disclosures should be part of the information provided by management outside the financial statements.
The Board's view is that financial statements would be incomplete and potentially misleading without disclosures about risks arising from financial instruments.
Hence, it concluded that such disclosures should be part of the financial statements.
The Board also noted that some entities might prefer to present the information required by the IFRS together with material such as a management commentary or risk report that is not part of the financial statements.
Some entities might be required by regulatory authorities to provide in a separate report information similar to that required by the IFRS.
Accordingly, the Board decided these disclosures should be given in the financial statements or incorporated by cross-reference from the financial statements to some other statement that is available to users of the financial statements on the same terms as the financial statements and at the same time.
The Board concluded that disclosures about an entity's exposure to risks arising from financial instruments should be required, and should be based on how the entity views and manages its risks, ie using the information provided to key management personnel (for example, its board of directors or chief executive officer).
provides a useful insight into how the entity views and manages risk;
results in information that has more predictive value than information based on assumptions and methods that management does not use, for instance, in considering the entity's ability to react to adverse situations;
is more effective in adapting to changes in risk measurement and management techniques and developments in the external environment;
has practical advantages for preparers of financial statements, because it allows them to use the data they use in managing risk; and
The Board considered whether it should require quantitative information about average risk exposures during the period.
It noted that information about averages is more informative if the risk exposure at the reporting date is not typical of the exposure during the period.
However, information about averages is also more onerous to prepare.
On balance, the Board decided to require disclosure of the exposures at the reporting date in all cases and to require additional information only if the information provided at the reporting date is unrepresentative of the entity's exposure to risk during the period.
BC48A In developing the impairment disclosure requirements in this IFRS, the Board sought to supplement the existing disclosures to meet the additional information needs of users of financial statements that will arise specifically from an impairment model based on expected credit losses.
The Board considered that information is useful and relevant when it enables users of financial statements to predict the likely amounts, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows.
an entity's credit risk management practices and how they relate to the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses;
the amounts in the financial statements that arise from expected credit losses that are measured in accordance with IFRS 9, including the changes in the estimate of expected credit losses and the reasons for the changes; and
an entity's credit risk profile (ie the credit risk inherent in an entity's financial instruments), including significant credit concentrations at the reporting date.
BC48D Requiring entities to estimate expected credit losses will increase the significance of forecasts and the use of an entity's judgement.
In the Board's view it is helpful for users of financial statements to understand the information entities use to estimate expected credit losses.
The Board considered that to understand how an entity has applied the proposed expected credit loss requirements, the following information would be relevant and useful
how significant increases in credit risk are assessed and identified;
how default is defined and the reasons for selecting that definition;
how an entity assesses that financial assets are credit-impaired; and
Given the various interpretations of default, the Board decided to require the disclosure of an entity's definition of default and the reasons for its selection.
This was included because feedback from users of financial statements indicated users would like to understand the extent to which recoveries of written off assets are still possible.
The Board acknowledged this desire, however it determined that the disclosure of the aggregate amount of financial assets that have been written off but that remain subject to enforcement activity would not provide the most relevant information for this purpose.
For example, the nominal amount could be very high (particularly as time passes, if the asset legally continues to accrue interest) even though the prospect of recovering any amounts outstanding might be extremely low.
In addition, the Board received feedback from preparers that tracking these amounts for an extended period would be operationally burdensome.
As a result, the Board decided to modify the disclosure and require that entities disclose the amount of financial assets that have been written off during the period, while narrative information is provided about financial assets that have previously been written off but that are still subject to enforcement activity.
BC48K  The Board also proposed narrative disclosures to complement the quantitative disclosures.
In the Board's view, users of financial statements would further benefit from a qualitative explanation of changes in estimates of expected credit losses.
Estimates of expected credit losses may change, for example, because of changes in the volume of financial instruments, changes in overall market conditions or as a result of a significant event (for example, a sovereign debt crisis, weather-related events or other disasters).
The disclosures should therefore include a qualitative narrative describing how significant events have affected the entity's estimate of expected credit losses.
Financial instruments evaluated on an individual basis
Many entities already disclose the loan balance and loss allowance amount for both collectively and individually assessed credit-impaired loans.
While these financial instruments may not have experienced an increase in credit risk greater than those evaluated on a group basis, the Board concluded that this distinction helps users of financial statements to understand how an entity is monitoring and managing credit risk, so it is useful even when the difference is not attributable to differences in credit risk.
These respondents argued that unlike in IAS 39, the loss allowance does not result from objective evidence of impairment on an individual asset.
BC48O The Board noted that conceptually, an assessment on an individual or collective basis should render the same result.
However, as noted in paragraph B5.5.2 of IFRS 9, an entity may not have access to reasonable and supportable information that enables it to identify significant increases in credit on an individual basis prior to financial assets becoming past due.
Furthermore, an entity may only be able to incorporate forward-looking information in its estimates of expected credit losses on a collective basis.
The Board therefore decided instead to require the disclosure of information about how an entity has grouped financial instruments if they are assessed or measured on a collective basis.
Amounts arising from expected credit losses
Reconciliation of the gross carrying amount and loss allowance
Almost all respondents supported the mandatory use of a loss allowance account.
Respondents (including preparers) generally supported disclosing a reconciliation (ie flow information) of changes in the loss allowance and stated that it was operational and useful.
They noted that when loss allowances are determined on a collective (ie portfolio) basis, an entity does not allocate loss allowances to individual financial assets.
Preparers also stated that the costs associated with the disclosure, and any disclosure about flow information, would be substantial.
BC48R During outreach, users of financial statements have consistently and strongly expressed the view that the change in the gross carrying amount of financial assets and the effect on the loss allowance are critical elements in understanding the credit quality of an entity's financial instruments and its credit risk management practices.
They held the view that the reconciliation of the gross carrying amount of financial instruments would greatly enhance transparency of an entity's financial asset portfolio.
BC48S The Board therefore decided to retain the requirement to provide a reconciliation of the changes in the loss allowance.
However, in the light of the feedback about the operational burden of reconciling the changes in the gross carrying amount of financial assets, the Board clarified that the objective of that reconciliation is to provide information about the key drivers for changes in the gross carrying amount to the extent that it contributes to changes in the loss allowance during the period.
Examples of such key drivers for change could include new originations and purchases, deterioration of existing financial instruments resulting in the loss allowance changing to lifetime expected credit losses and financial assets being written off during the period.
The Board also acknowledged that although the most relevant and useful information will be provided by disclosing the gross movements between loss allowance measurement categories, in some circumstances, or for some types of financial assets, information will be more useful if the movements are disclosed on a net basis (for example trade receivables accounted for in accordance with the general approach in IFRS 9).
The Board noted that it would be inappropriate to recognise a loss allowance for such financial instruments because there is no corresponding asset with which to present that loss allowance.
BC48V The Board therefore decided that the loss allowance on a loan commitment or a financial guarantee contract should be presented together with the loss allowance for expected credit losses on the associated financial asset, if an entity cannot separately identify the expected credit losses related to the separate components.
To the extent that the amount of expected credit losses on a loan commitment or a financial guarantee contract exceeds the carrying amount of the associated financial asset recognised in the statement of financial position, the remaining balance should be presented as a provision.
Purchased or originated credit-impaired assets
Consequently, the Board decided that an entity should disclose the undiscounted expected credit losses that are implicit in the pricing at initial recognition for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets.
Users of financial statements have indicated that such a disclosure would be helpful in alleviating some of the complexity in this area of accounting and would allow them to see the possible contractual cash flows that an entity could collect if there was a favourable change in expectations of credit losses for such assets.
BC48X Throughout the Impairment project, users of financial statements have noted that an area in which current disclosures and information is insufficient is that of restructurings and modifications.
Particularly during the global financial crisis, users have expressed frustration at the difficulty of understanding the extent of restructuring activity that entities are undertaking in respect of their financial assets.
This proposed requirement resulted from users of financial statements requesting information to enable them to understand the amount of financial assets that have been modified and that have subsequently improved in credit quality.
During redeliberations the Board noted operational concerns raised in feedback from preparers about the need to meet such a requirement by tracking individual financial assets, particularly even long after such assets have returned to a performing status and are no longer closely monitored for credit risk management purposes.
The Board noted that the usefulness of the information would decrease over time as an increasing number of assets are required to be included in the disclosure.
The Board rejected these views and confirmed that the scope of this guidance applies to all modifications of contractual cash flows, regardless of the reason for the modification.
In making this decision, the Board noted that an amortised cost carrying amount equates to the present value of the expected contractual cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
Consequently, the carrying amount should reflect changes in those contractual cash flows, irrespective of the reason for the modification occurring.
In addition, it was noted that any change in contractual terms will have an impact on credit risk, even if small.
Furthermore, the Board noted that it has been told previously that identifying those modifications that have been performed for credit risk management (ie non-commercial) purposes is operationally challenging.
Collateral and credit risk mitigation disclosures
For instance, an entity with more heavily collateralised loans will, all other things being equal, record a smaller loss allowance for credit losses than an entity with unsecured loans.
The Board maintained the view that information about the financial effect of collateral is useful.
However, the Board noted that it did not intend to require providing information about the fair value of collateral.
In addition, the Board decided that qualitative information should be disclosed about how collateral and other credit enhancements have been incorporated into the measurement of expected credit losses on all financial instruments.
Furthermore, without vintage information, a user would not be able to determine whether changes in the risk profile are a result of changes in the credit risk of existing financial instruments or a result of the credit risk of new instruments recognised during the period.
However, they believed that risk disaggregation would still provide insight into an entity's exposure to credit risk and were therefore in favour of including it in the notes to the financial statements.
The Board required the disclosure because changes in risk will affect the measurement of expected credit losses and it would therefore provide users of financial statements with information about the drivers of the change in the measurement.
The Board also noted that this disclosure, particularly when considered together with the reconciliation of the gross carrying amount and loss allowance, provides relevant and useful information about credit risk migration and changes in overall credit risk over time.
However, responses to the Supplementary Document considered this internal risk-rating information to be proprietary and therefore objected to this level of specificity.
Consequently, the Board decided not to propose this reconciliation.
The Board additionally decided to permit the use of an ageing analysis for financial assets for which delinquency information is the only borrower-specific information available to assess significant increases in credit risk.
The Board noted that these exemptions provide relief that is consistent with the intention to simplify the application of the impairment model for these categories of financial assets to alleviate some of the practical concerns of tracking changes in credit risk.
Paragraph 36(a) requires disclosure of an entity's maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.
However, the Board disagreed because it believes that such information
provides users of financial statements with a consistent measure of an entity's exposure to credit risk; and
takes into account the possibility that the maximum exposure to loss may differ from the amount recognised in the balance sheet.
Such an approach is consistent with the approach taken in paragraph 29(a), which states that disclosure of fair value is not required when the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Moreover, the Board concluded that the requirement might be duplicative for assets that are presented in the statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets often represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.
In the Board's view, the disclosure requirement should focus on the entity's exposure to credit risk that is not already reflected in the statement of financial position.
However, the Board noted that paragraph 36(a) requires disclosure of the amount that best represents the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date, which is the carrying amount.
Collateral held as security and other credit enhancements (paragraphs 36(b) and 37(c))
Respondents indicated that fair value information might not be available for
small entities and entities other than banks, which may find it onerous to acquire information about collateral;
banks that collect precise information on the value of collateral only on origination, for loans whose payments are made on time and in full (for example a mortgage portfolio secured by properties, for which valuations are not kept up to date on an asset-by-asset basis);
particular types of collateral, such as a floating charge on all the assets of an entity; and
insurers that hold collateral for which fair value information is not readily available.
The Board also noted respondents' concerns that an aggregate disclosure of the fair value of collateral held would be misleading when some loans in a portfolio are over-collateralised, and other loans have insufficient collateral.
The Board agreed with respondents that the information useful to users is not the total amount of credit exposure less the total amount of collateral, but rather is the amount of credit exposure that is left after available collateral is taken into account.
Therefore, the Board decided not to require disclosure of the fair value of collateral held, but to require disclosure of only a description of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements.
The Board noted that such disclosure does not require an entity to establish fair values for all its collateral (in particular when the entity has determined that the fair value of some collateral exceeds the carrying amount of the loan) and, thus, would be less onerous for entities to provide than fair values.
Credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired (paragraph 36(c))
The Board noted that information about credit quality gives a greater insight into the credit risk of assets and helps users assess whether such assets are more or less likely to become impaired in the future.
Because this information will vary between entities, the Board decided not to specify a particular method for giving this information, but rather to allow each entity to devise a method that is appropriate to its circumstances.
The Board deleted the requirement in paragraph 36(d) to disclose the carrying amount of financial assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.
The Board considered the difficulty in identifying financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated to avoid becoming past due or impaired (rather than for other commercial reasons).
The Board noted that the original requirement was unclear about whether the requirement applies only to financial assets that were renegotiated in the current reporting period or whether past negotiations of those assets should be considered.
Moreover, the Board was informed that commercial terms of loans are often renegotiated regularly for reasons that are not related to impairment.
In practice it is difficult, especially for a large portfolio of loans, to ascertain which loans were renegotiated to avoid becoming past due or impaired.
Financial assets that are either past due or impaired (paragraph 37)
The Board decided to require separate disclosure of financial assets that are past due or impaired to provide users with information about financial assets with the greatest credit risk (paragraph 37).
an analysis of the age of financial assets, including trade receivables, that are past due at the reporting date, but not impaired (paragraph 37(a)).
This information provides users with information about those financial assets that are more likely to become impaired and helps users to estimate the level of future impairment losses.
an analysis of financial assets that are individually determined to be impaired at the reporting date, including the factors the entity considered in determining that the financial assets are impaired (paragraph 37(b)).
Within a class of assets some might be over-collateralised while others might be under-collateralised.
Hence, aggregate disclosure of the fair value might be misleading.
However, the Board believes that information on the financial effect of such assets is useful to users.
The Board concluded that this information is useful because it provides information about the frequency of such activities and the entity's ability to obtain and realise the value of the collateral.
The Board noted that this amount might be more relevant in the case of collateral obtained that is expected to be sold.
However, it also noted that such an amount would be included in the impairment calculation that is reflected in the amount recognised in the balance sheet and the purpose of the disclosure is to indicate the amount recognised in the balance sheet for such assets.
The Board decided to require disclosure based on the earliest contractual maturity date because this disclosure shows a worst case scenario.
Some respondents expressed concerns that such a contractual maturity analysis does not reveal the expected maturity of liabilities, which, for some entities—eg banks with many demand deposits—may be very different.
They suggested that a contractual maturity analysis alone does not provide information about the conditions expected in normal circumstances or how the entity manages deviations from expected maturity.
Therefore, the Board decided to require a description of how the entity manages the liquidity risk portrayed by the contractual maturity analysis.
emphasising that an entity must provide summary quantitative data about its exposure to liquidity risk based on information provided internally to key management personnel of the entity as required by paragraph 34(a).
However, the Board noted that the requirement to provide disclosures based on the remaining contractual maturities was difficult to apply for some derivative financial liabilities and did not always result in information that reflects how many entities manage liquidity risk for such instruments.
Hence, for some circumstances the Board eliminated the previous requirement to disclose contractual maturity information for derivative financial liabilities.
However, the Board retained minimum contractual maturity disclosures for non-derivative financial liabilities (including issued financial guarantee contracts within the scope of the IFRS) and for some derivative financial liabilities.
BC58C The Board noted that for non-derivative financial liabilities (including issued financial guarantee contracts within the scope of the IFRS) and some derivative financial liabilities, contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of cash flows associated with the liabilities.
Therefore, this information is useful to users of financial statements.
The Board concluded that disclosures based on the remaining contractual maturities of these financial liabilities should continue to be required.
BC58D The Board also emphasised the existing requirement to disclose a maturity analysis for financial assets held for managing liquidity risk, if that information is required to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk.
The Board also emphasised that an entity must explain the relationship between qualitative and quantitative disclosures about liquidity risk so that users of financial statements can evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk.
users have consistently emphasised the fundamental importance of sensitivity analysis;
a sensitivity analysis can be disclosed for all types of market risk and by all entities, and is relatively easy to understand and calculate; and
it is suitable for all entities—including non-financial entities—that have financial instruments.
It is supported by disclosures of how the entity manages the risk.
For example, the analysis may not reveal non-linearities in sensitivities or the effects of interdependencies between variables.
Although more informative, such an analysis is also more complex and costly to prepare.
Accordingly, the Board decided not to require such an analysis, but to permit its disclosure as an alternative to the minimum requirement when it is used by management to manage risk.
However, entities that manage on the basis of value at risk would not want to prepare a separate sensitivity analysis solely for the purpose of this disclosure.
The Board's objective was to require disclosures about sensitivity, not to mandate a particular form of sensitivity disclosure.
Therefore, the Board decided not to require disclosure of the effects on profit or loss and equity if an alternative disclosure of sensitivity is made.
The Board concluded that it would not be possible to provide comprehensive guidance on the methodology to be used in preparing the sensitivity analysis.
Moreover, the effect of a reasonably possible change will vary depending on the entity's risk exposures.
As a result, entities are required to judge what those reasonably possible changes are.
However, the Board decided that it would provide high level application guidance about how the entity should assess what is a reasonably possible change and on the appropriate level of aggregation in the disclosures.
In response to comments received on ED 7, the Board also decided to clarify that
The sensitivity analysis shows the effect on current period profit or loss and equity if a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable had been applied to the risk exposures in existence at the balance sheet date.
The Board also decided to add a simple example of what a sensitivity analysis might look like.
The Board discussed whether it should require disclosure of information about operational risk.
However, the Board noted that the definition and measurement of operational risk are in their infancy and are not necessarily related to financial instruments.
It also decided that such disclosures would be more appropriately located outside the financial statements.
Therefore, the Board decided to defer this issue to its research project on management commentary.
In response to feedback received on the exposure draft the IASB developed more fully the alternative model described in the exposure draft and the boards discussed the alternative model.
their joint discussions of the alternative derecognition model described in the exposure draft;
the feedback the IASB received from national standard-setters on the largely favourable effects of the IFRS derecognition requirements during the financial crisis.
The boards also decided to conduct additional research and analysis, including a post-implementation review of some of the FASB's recently amended requirements, as a basis for assessing the nature and direction of any further efforts to improve or align IFRSs and US GAAP.
to evaluate the nature of and risks associated with the entity's continuing involvement in derecognised financial assets.
The Board concluded that in those situations, users of financial statements need to understand the relationship between those transferred financial assets and the associated liabilities that an entity recognises.
Understanding that relationship helps users of financial statements in assessing an entity's cash flow needs and the cash flows available to the entity from its assets.
The Board decided to continue requiring those disclosures because they provide information that is useful in understanding the relationship between transferred financial assets that are not derecognised and associated liabilities.
a qualitative description of the nature of the relationship between transferred assets and associated liabilities, including restrictions arising from the transfer on the reporting entity's use of the transferred assets; and
a schedule that sets out the fair value of the transferred financial assets, the associated liabilities and the net position when the counterparty to the associated liabilities has recourse only to the transferred assets.
BC65H The Board concluded that these disclosures would provide information that is useful in assessing the extent to which the economic benefits generated by assets of an entity cannot be used in an unrestricted manner, as is implied when assets are recognised in an entity's statement of financial position.
In addition, the disclosures would provide information about liabilities that will be settled entirely from the proceeds received from the transferred assets, and thus identify liabilities for which the counterparties do not have claims on the assets of the entity in general.
For those assets for which the underlying cash flows are committed to be used to satisfy related liabilities, the Board noted that a schedule that sets out the fair value of the transferred financial assets, the associated liabilities and the net position (in addition to showing the cash flow relationship between those assets and liabilities) also provides a means of understanding the net exposure of an entity following a transfer transaction that fails derecognition.
The Board was asked by users of financial statements, regulators and others to review the disclosure requirements for what are often described as 'off balance sheet' activities.
Transfers of financial assets, particularly securitisation of financial assets, were identified as forming part of such activities.
The Board concluded that when an entity retains continuing involvement in financial assets that it has derecognised, users of financial statements would benefit from information about the risks to which the entity remains exposed.
Such information is relevant in assessing the amount, timing and uncertainty of the entity's future cash flows.
However, the IFRS requires the information at an aggregated level, so information specific to derecognition transactions is often not available.
In response to requests from users and others the Board concluded that disclosures specific to derecognition transactions were necessary.
The Board reasoned that a combination of disclosures about the strike price or repurchase price to repurchase assets, the fair value of its continuing involvement, the maximum exposure to loss and qualitative information about an entity's obligations to provide financial support are relevant in understanding an entity's exposure to risks.
BC65M In addition, the Board concluded that information about an entity's gain or loss on derecognition and the timing of recognition of that gain or loss provides information about the proportion of an entity's profit or loss that arises from transferring financial assets in which the entity also retains continuing involvement.
Such information is useful in assessing the extent to which an entity generates profits from transferring financial assets while retaining some form of continuing involvement and thus exposure to risk.
The Board decided that if transfer activity is concentrated around the end of reporting periods, disclosure of this fact provides an indication of whether transfer transactions are undertaken for the purpose of altering the appearance of the statement of financial position rather than for an ongoing commercial or financing purpose.
In such cases, the amendments require disclosure of when the greatest transfer activity took place within that reporting period, the amount recognised from the transfer activity in that part of the reporting period, and the total amount of proceeds from transfer activity in that part of the reporting period.
Application of the disclosure requirements to a servicing contract
The Board observed, however, that a servicing contract is generally continuing involvement for the purposes of the transfer disclosure requirements because, in most cases, the servicer has an interest in the future performance of the transferred financial assets as a result of that contract.
That would be the case if the amount and/or timing of the servicing fee depended on the amount and/or timing of the cash flows collected from the transferred financial asset.
In addition, some preparers will need time to make the system changes necessary to comply with the IFRS.
The Board noted that most of the risk disclosures, in particular those about market risk, are based on information collected at the end of the reporting period.
The Board also noted that comparative disclosures about risk are less relevant because these disclosures are intended to have predictive value.
The Board considered and rejected arguments that it should extend the exemption
Application of the amendment to such a period might therefore require an entity to determine the fair value as at the end of the period for a servicing asset or servicing liability, which the entity might not have previously determined.
It might be impracticable for an entity to determine the fair value of such a servicing asset or servicing liability without using hindsight.
The IFRS permits entities to determine the amount of change in fair value attributable to changes in the instrument's credit risk using an alternative method if the entity believes that its alternative method gives more faithful representation.
The proxy disclosure has been amended to be the amount of change in fair value that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk.
As a result, entities may exclude factors other than a change in a benchmark interest rate when calculating the proxy.
No disclosure is required of whether the entity has complied with capital targets set by management and of the consequences of any non-compliance with those targets.
In the amended paragraphs, new text is underlined and deleted text is struck through.
the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract--for example, direct labour and materials; and
an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts--for example, an allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and equipment used in fulfilling that contract among others.
The entity shall not restate comparative information.
Basis for Conclusions on the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting
THE OBJECTIVE OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF USEFUL FINANCIAL INFORMATION
FUNDAMENTAL AND ENHANCING QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS
OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PERSPECTIVE ADOPTED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MEASUREMENT BASES AND THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE
CLASSIFICATION OF INCOME AND EXPENSES
This Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework).
It summarises the considerations of the International Accounting Standards Board (Board) in developing the Conceptual Framework.
Long-term investment as a business activity
Information needs of long-term investors
The chapters on the objective of general purpose financial reporting and qualitative characteristics of useful financial information came into effect as soon as they were issued.
In addition to finalising the chapters on the objective of general purpose financial reporting and qualitative characteristics of useful financial information, the Board and the FASB
discussed the definitions of the elements of financial statements; and
discussed and held public round-table meetings about measurement.
Most respondents to that consultation identified the Conceptual Framework as a priority project for the Board.
Developing the Conceptual Framework as a whole enabled the Board and stakeholders to see more clearly the links between different aspects of the Conceptual Framework.
The FASB did not make corresponding changes to its Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts.
some important areas were not covered;
the guidance in some areas was unclear; and
some aspects were out of date.
In particular, although the Board reconsidered some aspects of chapters on the objective of financial reporting and qualitative characteristics of useful financial information, it did not reconsider those chapters fundamentally.
BC0.12 The Board normally establishes a consultative group for major projects.
Some stakeholders stated that in some areas the Board's proposals merely described the factors that the Board would consider in making judgements when developing Standards.
They expressed the view that, as a result, the proposals did not examine fundamental concepts and were not sufficiently aspirational.
The Board did not share that view.
The Board viewed the Conceptual Framework as a practical tool to help it to develop Standards.
The Board concluded that a Conceptual Framework would not fulfil this role if it described concepts without explaining the factors the Board needs to consider in making judgements when the application of concepts does not lead to a single answer, or leads to conflicting answers.
The Board's aim in doing so was to reflect the Board's most developed thinking on these matters, not to justify its standard-setting decisions or current practice.
The Board may consider revising that discussion in the future if it considers that necessary.
The Board concluded that these issues would best be dealt with if it were to carry out projects to consider revising Standards on these topics.
BC0.19 The Board considered whether to focus the stated purpose of the Conceptual Framework by stating that its primary purpose would be only to assist the Board in developing Standards.
The Board rejected this approach because acknowledging the assistance the Conceptual Framework can give to other parties would not prevent the Board from developing focused and consistent concepts that will help it to develop Standards.
BC0.20 Although preparers apply the Conceptual Framework in developing accounting policies when no Standard applies to a particular transaction or other event or when a Standard allows a choice of accounting policy, a few aspects of the Conceptual Framework can only be applied by the Board.
BC0.22 The Board found that the status of the Conceptual Framework has worked well in practice.
Also, an explicit statement that the Conceptual Framework does not override any requirements in a Standard prevents entities from attempting to override inappropriately Standards those entities might view as contradicting the Conceptual Framework.
It is helpful for the Conceptual Framework to acknowledge this, and to specify that such departures are appropriate only if needed to meet the objective of general purpose financial reporting.
That need might arise because conceptual thinking or the economic environment may change, and new or revised Standards might need to reflect these changes.
In response, the Board tested the revised definitions of an asset and a liability and the guidance supporting those definitions (see paragraphs BC4.19–BC4.22).
In addition, the Board tested for inconsistencies between the revised concepts and existing Standards.
BC0.25 The aim of these tests was not to identify whether the Board should develop proposals to amend any Standards following the revision of the Conceptual Framework.
Amending a Standard is not an automatic consequence of that revision.
Changes to Standards are made to address deficiencies in financial reporting.
The Board will consider whether it should amend this section of the IFRS for SMEs Standard when it next reviews that Standard.
An entity's business activities are a matter of fact that can in most cases be determined objectively.
Hence, if entities conduct the same type of business activities, the Board expects that those activities would be reflected in a similar manner in the entities' financial statements.
BC0.31 The Board considered whether the nature of business activities should be considered in all areas of standard-setting and should be embedded in the Conceptual Framework as an overarching concept.
The Board concluded that the nature of an entity's business activities does not affect all areas of financial reporting in the same way and to the same extent and so it should not be included as an overarching concept.
In a particular Standard, the concept of business activities can be further explained and developed.
Governments have indicated that encouraging long-term investment is an important tool for promoting economic growth.
This is a precondition for the healthy and efficient functioning of financial markets.
Transparent financial reporting helps market participants to make more efficient and informed resource allocation and other economic decisions and thus makes investment more attractive to capital providers (investors and lenders).
Instead, standard-setting decisions are driven by the need for entities to provide useful information.
the business activity of long-term investment (see paragraphs BC0.37–BC0.39); and
the information needs of long-term investors (see paragraphs BC0.40–BC0.43).
BC0.37 The Board considered a suggestion made by some stakeholders that it should identify long-term investment as a particular type of business activity (or business model) and develop specific measurement and presentation and disclosure requirements for entities conducting that business activity.
Some stakeholders expressing those views suggested that
entities should not use a current value measurement basis for their long-term investments and for their liabilities; or
if a current value measurement basis is used for those investments and liabilities, income and expenses resulting from remeasurements should be included in other comprehensive income, not in the statement of profit or loss.
Thus, the nature of an entity's business activities is considered in selecting a measurement basis for an asset or liability and for related income and expenses.
referring explicitly to any particular business activity would, inappropriately, embed excessive detail in the Conceptual Framework; and
the Conceptual Framework does not refer to any other business activity.
Views expressed by these stakeholders included the following
Hence, these stakeholders argue that long-term investors need information that helps them to assess management's stewardship of the entity's economic resources.
lead to excessive and volatile dividend distributions that are not in the best interest of long-term investors;
lead to inflated management remuneration (including bonuses); and
(iii) encourage short-termism and financial engineering and discourage long-term investment.
BC0.41 For the following reasons, the Board disagreed with the views expressed in paragraph BC0.40
The Board considers both long-term investors and short-term investors to be primary users of financial statements.
The Board's discussions with users in its project on the Conceptual Framework and in many other projects have identified no reasons why existing investors would need information that differs from the information needed by potential investors.
Instead, the Board's decisions have been driven by an assessment of what information is most likely to be useful to the primary users of financial statements, including both long-term and short-term investors.
Distribution policy is affected by many other factors, for example, the entity's financing needs, current and projected liquidity, the risks faced by the entity, legal constraints and (in the case of bonus decisions) remuneration policy and incentive arrangements.
These factors differ by entity, by country and over time.
It would be neither desirable nor feasible for the Board to consider them in standard-setting decisions.
However, the Board concluded that to help it to identify what information particular Standards should require entities to provide, there is no need for the Conceptual Framework to contain a specific reference to the needs of long-term investors.
When the Board develops Standards, it routinely seeks input and feedback from investors, including long-term investors, to help ensure that it understands what information they need.
Should there be a primary user group?
Why are existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors considered the primary users?
In the light of these comments, the Board considered whether to make changes in the following areas
primary users (see paragraphs BC1.18–BC1.20); and
Consistently with the Board's responsibilities, the Conceptual Framework establishes an objective of financial reporting and not just of financial statements.
Financial statements are a central part of financial reporting, and most of the issues that the Board addresses involve financial statements.
New technologies, for example the use of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), may make it practicable in the future for reporting entities either to prepare or to make available the information necessary for different users to assemble different financial reports to meet their individual information needs.
To provide different reports for different users, or to make available all of the information that users would need to assemble their own custom-designed reports, would be expensive.
Requiring users of financial information to assemble their own reports might also be unreasonable, because many users would need to have a greater understanding of accounting than they have now.
Therefore, the Board concluded that for now a general purpose financial report is still the most efficient and effective way to meet the information needs of a variety of users.
External was intended to convey that internal users such as management were not the intended beneficiaries for general purpose financial reporting as established by the Board.
Over time, the separation between businesses and their owners has grown.
The reasons are discussed in paragraphs BC1.15–BC1.17 and BC1.21–BC1.26.
The Board sympathised with their information needs but concluded that without a defined group of primary users, the Conceptual Framework would risk becoming unduly abstract or vague.
Others said that the primary users should be existing shareholders and creditors, and that financial reports should focus on their needs.
BC1.16 The reasons why the Board concluded that the primary user group should be the existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors of a reporting entity are
However, too much is a subjective judgement.
In developing financial reporting requirements that meet the objective of financial reporting, the boards will rely on the qualitative characteristics of, and the cost constraint on, useful financial information to provide discipline to avoid providing too much information.
These respondents stated that the Board should describe primary users as holders of equity claims against the entity (or perhaps as the holders of the most residual equity claims against the entity).
The respondents argued that holders of equity claims have different (and perhaps more extensive) information needs than other capital providers because they are exposed to more extensive risks.
Nevertheless, it concluded that its reasons for describing the primary user group as the existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors of a reporting entity were still valid (see paragraph BC1.16).
Consequently, the Board concluded that no changes to the description of the primary user group were needed.
However, the Board observed that individual users may have information needs and desires that are different from, and possibly conflict with, those of other users with the same type of interest in the reporting entity.
General purpose financial reports are intended to provide common information to users and cannot accommodate every request for information.
The Board will seek the information set that is intended to meet the needs of the maximum number of users in cost-beneficial ways.
BC1.22 Some stakeholders questioned the interaction between general purpose financial reporting and management's needs.
The Board stated that some of the information directed to the primary users is likely to meet some of management's needs but not all of them.
However, management has the ability to access additional financial information, and consequently, general purpose financial reporting need not be explicitly directed to management.
BC1.23 Some stakeholders said that maintaining financial stability in capital markets (the stability of a country's or region's economy or financial systems) should be an objective of financial reporting.
They stated that financial reporting should focus on the needs of regulators and fiscal policy decision-makers who are responsible for maintaining financial stability.
BC1.24 Other stakeholders opposed establishing an objective to maintain financial stability.
They said that financial statements should present the economic reality of the reporting entity with as little bias as possible, but that such a presentation is not necessarily inconsistent with a financial stability objective.
BC1.25 However, advocates of a financial stability objective had a different outcome in mind.
They did not encourage the Board to require reporting entities to provide information for use by regulators and fiscal policy decision-makers.
Instead, they recommended that the Board consider the consequences of new Standards for the stability of the world's economies and financial systems and, at least at times, assign greater weight to that objective than to the information needs of investors, lenders and other creditors.
However, expanding the objective of financial reporting to include maintaining financial stability could at times create conflicts between the objectives that the Board is not well-equipped to resolve.
For example, some may take the view that the best way to maintain financial stability is to require entities not to report, or to delay reporting, some changes in asset or liability values.
That requirement would almost certainly result in depriving investors, lenders and other creditors of information that they need.
The only way to avoid conflicts would be to eliminate or de-emphasise the existing objective of providing information to investors, lenders and other creditors.
The Board concluded that eliminating that objective would be inconsistent with its basic mission, which is to serve the information needs of participants in capital markets.
Those frameworks also stated that financial information that is useful in making economic decisions would also be helpful in assessing how management has fulfilled its stewardship responsibility.
For example, shareholders who vote on whether to retain directors or replace them, and on how members of management should be remunerated for their services, need information on which to base their decisions.
Shareholders' decision-making process may include evaluating how management of the entity performed against management in competing entities in similar circumstances.
BC1.29 The Board agreed with these respondents and noted that, in most cases, information designed for resource allocation decisions would also be useful for assessing management's performance.
Consequently, both sections addressed the same points and provided more detail than was necessary.
Both are important for making decisions about providing resources to an entity, and information about stewardship is also important for resource providers who have the ability to vote on, or otherwise influence, management's actions.
Instead, the Board described what stewardship encapsulates.
The Board reintroduced the term 'stewardship' and, in describing the objective of general purpose financial reporting, gave more prominence to the importance of providing information needed to assess management's stewardship of the entity's economic resources.
That extra prominence contributes to highlighting management's accountability to users for economic resources entrusted to their care.
Both types of information are needed to meet the overall objective of financial reporting — that is to provide information that is useful for making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity (resource allocation decisions).
BC1.35 The Board also considered other approaches suggested by some stakeholders.
Those approaches would have identified the provision of information to help to assess management's stewardship as part of the objective of financial reporting or as an additional and equally prominent objective.
The Board rejected those approaches because
Thus, in their view, resource allocation decisions excluded decisions made while holding an investment, for example, decisions to reappoint or replace management, to assess the adequacy of management's remuneration or to approve a business strategy proposed by management.
Users of financial statements need to assess both the amount, timing and uncertainty of future net cash inflows and management's stewardship of the entity's economic resources to make any of these decisions.
That vote will ultimately influence the Board of directors' subsequent actions affecting the use of the entity's economic resources.
However, financial reporting is not designed to provide information that will help the primary users of that information to exercise their rights to vote on other actions by management, such as developing a statement on an issue of a public policy that does not directly affect the use of the entity's economic resources.
In particular, these respondents focused on the selection of a measurement basis
That assessment enables users of financial statements to hold management to account for its actions.
smaller entities versus larger entities;
closely held entities versus those with widely dispersed ownership.
Therefore, the Board concluded that the objective of general purpose financial reports is the same for all entities.
However, cost constraints and differences in activities among entities may sometimes lead the Board to permit or require differences in reporting for different types of entities.
Investors, creditors, and others who are concerned with assessing the prospects for enterprise net cash inflows are especially interested in that information.
BC1.45 To be useful for decision-making, financial reports must provide information about a reporting entity's economic resources and claims, and the change during a period in economic resources and claims.
A reporting entity cannot provide reasonably complete information about its financial performance (as represented by comprehensive income, profit or loss or other similar terms) without identifying and measuring its economic resources and the claims.
The reason for the change is that in many cases, claims against an entity are not claims on specific resources.
In addition, many claims will be satisfied using resources that will result from future net cash inflows.
Thus, while all claims are claims against the entity, not all are claims against the entity's existing resources.
Assessing solvency is of interest to investors, lenders and other creditors, and the objective of general purpose financial reporting is to provide information that is useful to them for making decisions.
To do so would be inconsistent with the objective of serving the common information needs of the primary user group.
Can faithful representation be empirically measured?
substance over form (see paragraph BC2.33);
The Board also made some editorial changes to Chapter 2, mainly to use the term 'faithful representation' more precisely by discussing whether financial information faithfully represents what it purports to represent (for example, an economic phenomenon), rather than by discussing whether financial information itself is faithfully represented.
Alternatives are available for all aspects of financial reporting, including recognition, derecognition, measurement, classification, presentation and disclosure.
When developing Standards, the Board will choose the alternative that goes furthest towards achieving the objective of financial reporting.
Preparers of financial information will also have to choose among the alternatives in a way that achieves the objective of financial reporting if no Standards apply or if application of a particular Standard requires judgements or provides options.
The decision-makers on which this Conceptual Framework focuses are existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors.
That objective by itself leaves a great deal to judgement and provides little guidance on how to exercise that judgement.
Subsequent chapters use the qualitative characteristics to help guide choices about recognition, measurement and the other aspects of financial reporting.
Others said that the most important qualitative characteristic differs depending on the circumstances; therefore, differentiating qualitative characteristics was not appropriate.
BC2.11 The Board does not agree that the distinction is arbitrary.
However, financial information that is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent may still be useful even if it does not have any of the enhancing qualitative characteristics.
BC2.12 It is self-evident that financial information is useful for making a decision only if it is capable of making a difference in that decision.
However, users consider a variety of information from many sources, and the extent to which a decision is affected by information about a particular economic phenomenon is difficult, if not impossible, to determine, even after the fact.
The Board also assesses relevance by meeting users to discuss proposed Standards, potential agenda decisions, effects on reported information of applying recently implemented Standards and other matters.
Information has predictive value if it can be used in making predictions about the eventual outcomes of past or current events.
In contrast, statisticians use predictability to refer to the accuracy with which it is possible to foretell the next number in a series and persistence to refer to the tendency of a series of numbers to continue to change as it has changed in the past.
Rather, materiality is an aspect of relevance, because immaterial information does not affect a user's decision.
Furthermore, a standard-setter does not consider materiality when developing standards because it is an entity-specific consideration.
The boards agreed with those views and concluded that materiality is an aspect of relevance that applies at the individual entity level.
This clarification emphasises that decisions about materiality are intended to reflect the needs of the primary users, not the needs of any other group.
Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.
The comments of respondents to numerous proposed standards indicated a lack of a common understanding of the term 'reliability'.
Some focused on verifiability or free from material error to the virtual exclusion of faithful representation.
Others focused more on faithful representation, perhaps combined with neutrality.
Some apparently think that reliability refers primarily to precision.
BC2.26 Because attempts to explain what reliability was intended to mean in this context have proved unsuccessful, the Board sought a different term that would more clearly convey the intended meaning.
The term 'faithful representation', the faithful depiction in financial reports of economic phenomena, was the result of that search.
That term encompasses the main characteristics that the previous frameworks included as aspects of reliability.
However, many respondents who made those comments assigned a different meaning to reliability from what the Board meant.
In particular, many respondents' descriptions of reliability more closely resembled the Board's notion of verifiability than its notion of reliability.
Those comments led the Board to affirm its decision to replace the term 'reliability' with 'faithful representation'.
This interpretation of faithful representation would allow the recognition of items that cannot be measured reliably.
Consequently, the qualitative characteristic of faithful representation does not act as an effective filter when identifying the types of information to be included in financial statements.
More relevant information may lack reliability and more reliable information may lack relevance.
Treating that concept solely as an enhancing qualitative characteristic (verifiability, see paragraphs BC2.60–BC2.62) gives it too little weight.
This use of reliability is much less frequent in Standards.
Hence, the Board retained the term 'faithful representation' as the label for the qualitative characteristic previously called 'reliability'.
Can be depended on by users to faithfully represent what it purports to represent
Free from material error or bias
Faithful representation means that financial information represents the substance of an economic phenomenon rather than merely representing its legal form.
Representing a legal form that differs from the economic substance of the underlying economic phenomenon could not result in a faithful representation.
They said that the framework should include conservatism, prudence or both.
They said that bias should not always be assumed to be undesirable, especially in circumstances when bias, in their view, produces information that is more relevant to some users.
BC2.35 Deliberately reflecting conservative estimates of assets, liabilities, income or equity has sometimes been considered desirable to counteract the effects of some management estimates that have been perceived as excessively optimistic.
In their view, relevant information must have purpose, and information with a purpose is not neutral.
In other words, because financial reporting is a tool to influence decision-making, it cannot be neutral.
Obviously, reported financial information is expected to influence the actions of users of that information, and the mere fact that many users take similar actions on the basis of reported information does not demonstrate a lack of neutrality.
The Board does not attempt to encourage or predict specific actions of users.
If financial information is biased in a way that encourages users to take or avoid predetermined actions, that information is not neutral.
Stakeholders expressed a range of views on how to achieve such asymmetry and to what extent it should be achieved.
For example, some advocate a concept of prudence that would
require more persuasive evidence to support the recognition of income or assets than the recognition of expenses or liabilities; or
require the selection of measurement bases that recognise losses at an earlier stage than gains.
BC2.38 An understanding of prudence is linked to an understanding of the term 'neutrality'.
the neutral application of accounting policies — applying the selected accounting policies in a neutral (ie unbiased) manner (see paragraph BC2.39); and
the selection of neutral accounting policies — selecting accounting policies in order to provide relevant information that faithfully represents the items that it purports to represent (see paragraph BC2.44).
A faithful representation requires that the depiction is neutral.
BC2.39 The Board was persuaded by the arguments made by some stakeholders that applying prudence (defined as the exercise of caution when making judgements under conditions of uncertainty) can help to achieve neutrality in applying accounting policies.
Thus, 'cautious prudence' (see paragraph BC2.37(a)) can help to achieve a faithful representation of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses.
Setting out that message clearly is expected to
help the Board to develop rigorous Standards that would reduce the risk of management bias in applying the reporting entity's accounting policies.
People continued to use the term, but did not always say clearly what they meant by it.
In addition, some stakeholders said that, because the term had been removed, financial information prepared using IFRS Standards was not neutral but was, in fact, imprudent.
The Board concluded that it would reduce the confusion by reintroducing the term with a clear explanation that caution works both ways, so that assets and liabilities are neither overstated nor understated.
asymmetric prudence reflects the view that investors are more interested in downside risk than upside potential;
asymmetric prudence is inherent in many Standards and the Conceptual Framework should acknowledge this fact so that asymmetric prudence could be applied consistently when developing Standards;
by limiting management remuneration, asymmetric prudence would reduce management's opportunism and encourage long-term growth.
The Board noted that, depending on its exact nature, the requirement to apply asymmetric prudence in all circumstances might
prohibit the recognition of all unrealised gains.
In some circumstances, for example, in the measurement of many financial instruments, recognising unrealised gains is necessary to provide relevant information to users of financial reports.
prohibit the recognition of all unrealised gains not supported by observable market prices.
In some circumstances, measuring an asset or liability at a current value (which may require the recognition of unrealised gains) provides relevant information to users of financial reports even if the current value cannot be determined directly by observing prices in an active market.
permit an entity to measure an asset at an amount lower than an unbiased estimate using the measurement basis selected for that asset or to measure a liability at an amount higher than such an estimate.
Such an approach cannot result in relevant information and cannot provide a faithful representation.
The selection of neutral accounting policies means selecting accounting policies in a manner that is not intended to increase the probability that financial information will be received favourably or unfavourably by users.
does not require an entity to recognise the value of the entity in the statement of financial position.
does not require the recognition of all assets and liabilities.
does not require the measurement of all assets and liabilities at a current value.
Considering those factors would not lead to such a requirement.
does not prohibit impairment tests on assets measured at historical cost.
Measurement at historical cost, including an impairment test, is consistent with neutrality if that measurement basis is selected without bias.
The absence of bias means that the measurement basis is selected without slanting, weighting, emphasising, de-emphasising or otherwise manipulating information to increase the probability that it will be received favourably or unfavourably by users.
This would be the consequence of the Board taking decisions that it believes require entities to produce the most relevant information that faithfully represents what it purports to represent, rather than a consequence of applying asymmetric prudence.
A faithful representation, by itself, does not necessarily result in useful information.
A slightly more subtle example is an estimate of the amount by which an asset's carrying amount should be adjusted to reflect an impairment in the asset's value.
That estimate can be a faithful representation if the reporting entity has properly applied an appropriate process, properly described the estimate and explained any uncertainties that significantly affect the estimate.
However, if the level of uncertainty in such an estimate is sufficiently large, that estimate will not be particularly useful.
In other words, the relevance of the asset being faithfully represented is questionable.
If there is no alternative representation that is more faithful, that estimate may provide the best available information.
Thus, measurement uncertainty associated with the estimation process does not affect relevance; it affects whether that measure can be provided in a way that produces a faithful representation.
For example, if the underlying phenomenon is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, a highly uncertain measure may provide the only relevant information about that phenomenon.
However, such studies have not provided techniques for empirically measuring faithful representation apart from relevance.
BC2.51 Both previous frameworks discussed the desirability of providing statistical information about how faithfully a financial measure is represented.
That would not be unprecedented.
Other statistical information is sometimes reflected in financial reports.
For example, some entities disclose value at risk from derivative financial instruments and similar positions.
The Board expects that the use of statistical concepts for financial reporting in some situations will continue to be important.
Unfortunately, the Board and the FASB have not identified any way to quantify the faithfulness of the representations in a financial report.
It further stated that neither a faithful representation of an irrelevant phenomenon nor an unfaithful representation of a relevant phenomenon helps users to make useful decisions.
Their main concern seemed to relate to the relationship between the relevance of information and the tolerable level of measurement uncertainty for that information.
BC2.56 The Board concluded that an explicit acknowledgement of the trade-off between relevance and measurement uncertainty would help to explain why, in some cases, an estimate with a high level of measurement uncertainty might, nevertheless, provide useful information — for example, in cases when the only relevant information is a highly uncertain estimate.
BC2.57 In addition, the Board updated the terminology used in the description of the process of applying fundamental qualitative characteristics.
However, even if it is not readily comparable, information that is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent is still useful.
Comparable information, however, is not useful if it is not relevant and may mislead if it does not faithfully represent what it purports to represent.
Therefore, comparability is considered an enhancing qualitative characteristic instead of a fundamental qualitative characteristic.
Lack of verifiability does not necessarily render information useless, but users are likely to be more cautious because there is a greater risk that the information does not faithfully represent what it purports to represent.
Therefore, verifiability was considered an aspect of faithful representation.
Some respondents pointed out that including verifiability as an aspect of faithful representation could result in excluding information that is not readily verifiable.
Those respondents recognised that many forward-looking estimates that are very important in providing relevant financial information (for example, expected cash flows, useful lives and residual values) cannot be directly verified.
However, excluding information about those estimates would make the financial reports much less useful.
The Board agreed and repositioned verifiability as an enhancing qualitative characteristic, very desirable but not necessarily required.
However, some respondents pointed out that timeliness is not part of relevance in the same sense that predictive and confirmatory value are.
The Board was persuaded that timeliness is different from the other components of relevance.
BC2.65 Timeliness is very desirable, but it is not as critical as relevance and faithful representation.
Timely information is useful only if it is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent.
In contrast, relevant information that provides a faithful representation may still be useful (especially for confirmatory purposes) even if it is not reported in as timely a manner as would be desirable.
Both frameworks also similarly described that for financial information to be understandable, users should have a reasonable degree of financial knowledge and a willingness to study the information with reasonable diligence.
BC2.67 Despite those discussions of understandability and users' responsibilities for understanding financial reports, misunderstanding persists.
For example, some have expressed the view that a new accounting method should not be implemented because some users might not understand it, even though the new accounting method would result in reporting financial information that is useful for decision-making.
They imply that understandability is more important than relevance.
Classifying understandability as an enhancing qualitative characteristic is intended to indicate that information that is difficult to understand should be presented and explained as clearly as possible.
However, transparency, high quality, internal consistency, true and fair view or fair presentation are different words to describe information that has the qualitative characteristics of relevance and representational faithfulness enhanced by comparability, verifiability, timeliness and understandability.
Credibility is similar but also implies trustworthiness of a reporting entity's management.
BC2.71 Interested parties sometimes suggested other criteria for standard-setting decisions, and the Board has at times cited some of those criteria as part of the rationale for some decisions.
Those criteria include simplicity, operationality, practicability or practicality, and acceptability.
Instead, they are part of the overall weighing of benefits and costs of providing useful financial information.
For example, a simpler method may be less costly to apply than a more complex method.
In some circumstances, a simpler method may result in information that is essentially the same as, but somewhat less precise than, information produced by a more complex method.
In that situation, a standard-setter would include the decrease in faithful representation and the decrease in implementation cost in weighing benefits against costs.
BC2.74 The Board has attempted and continues to attempt to develop more structured methods of obtaining information about the cost of gathering and processing the information that proposed Standards would require entities to provide.
The primary method used is to request interested parties, sometimes formally (such as by field tests and questionnaires), to submit cost and benefit information for a specific proposal that is quantified to the extent feasible.
Those requests have resulted in helpful information and have led directly to changes to proposed requirements to reduce the costs without significantly reducing the related benefits.
Description and boundary of the reporting entity
Joint control and significant influence
Those qualitative characteristics apply to both financial information provided in financial statements and financial information provided in other financial reports.
Financial statements are a central part of financial reporting and most issues that the Board addresses involve financial statements.
Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and financial performance of an entity.
The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions.
Financial statements also show the results of the management's stewardship of the resources entrusted to it.
assets, liabilities and equity instead of financial position; and
income and expenses instead of financial performance.
Information needs to be useful in assessing the prospects for future net cash inflows to the reporting entity and in assessing management's stewardship of the entity's economic resources.
In addition, it is necessary to identify those statements as the place where recognition occurs because otherwise it would not be possible to describe recognition clearly.
In contrast, because cash inflows and cash outflows and contributions from holders of equity claims and distributions to them are not elements of financial statements, statements providing information about those items do not provide a summary of recognised elements.
Hence, they argued that 'information about risks' could be understood to include almost any type of information, including information that would be best reported outside financial statements.
Indeed, some argued that the information about how an entity manages risks belongs outside financial statements.
If information were to be directed towards the needs of a particular subset of primary users, it might be necessary to provide different sets of financial statements for each subset.
That could cause confusion and undermine confidence in financial reporting.
In addition, as mentioned in paragraph BC1.6, providing different reports for different subsets of primary users could be expensive.
The Board has no authority to determine who must, should or could prepare such statements.
economic activities of an entity are being conducted, have been conducted or will be conducted;
economic activities of the entity can be objectively distinguished from those of other entities and from the economic environment in which the entity exists; and
BC3.15 The Board concluded that the feature mentioned in paragraph BC3.14(b)(iii) plays a role in determining the boundary of the reporting entity (see paragraph BC3.18).
the financial statements of an entity that has never conducted and will never conduct economic activities are unlikely to provide useful information to users of financial statements; and
the terms 'circumscribed area' and 'objectively distinguished' are vague and unclear, so they would not provide clear guidance on what constitutes a reporting entity.
It further proposed that financial statements should describe the set of economic activities included within the reporting entity.
In particular, they were concerned that a reporting entity that is a portion of an entity could choose to report on an incomplete set of economic activities, for example, by excluding from its financial statements the reporting entity's share of overheads.
In addition, there may be difficulties in identifying which claims should be included in financial statements if the reporting entity is a portion of an entity.
The Board concluded that the completeness and neutrality aspects of the qualitative characteristic of faithful representation are particularly important in determining the boundary of a reporting entity.
For example, if the boundary of a reporting entity were determined in such a way that the boundary contains an arbitrary or incomplete set of economic activities, financial information provided in that reporting entity's financial statements would be incomplete and may also lack neutrality.
Thus, if the boundary were to be determined in such a way, the resulting information would not meet users' information needs.
The Board also concluded that to help users to understand what is included in a set of financial statements, those financial statements need to describe how the boundary of the reporting entity was determined and what constitutes the reporting entity.
BC3.19 Determining the boundary of a reporting entity is normally straightforward if that entity is a legal entity or if that entity comprises only legal entities all linked by a parent-subsidiary relationship.
In those cases, the boundary of the legal entity or legal entities determines the boundary of the reporting entity.
Determining the boundary in this way meets users' information needs.
Many of those who commented welcomed a discussion of this issue, but disagreed with restricting the preparation of combined financial statements to entities under common control.
BC3.21 The Board concluded that combined financial statements can provide useful information to users of financial statements in some circumstances.
The Board concluded that such discussion would be best developed if the Board decides in the future to develop a Standard on this topic.
In the case of consolidated financial statements, the information needs of primary users may differ depending on whether their focus is on the parent (see paragraphs BC3.23–BC3.24) or on the subsidiaries (see paragraph BC3.25).
Consolidated financial statements provide that information.
prepare unconsolidated financial statements in addition to consolidated financial statements it prepares; or
provide information about the assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses of the parent alone in consolidated financial statements, in the notes.
For example, some information about a subsidiary's assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses may be material to the financial statements of the subsidiary, but may not be material to the consolidated financial statements of the parent.
The subsidiary's own financial statements are designed to provide the primary users of its financial statements with information about the subsidiary's assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses.
Separate definition of an economic resource
Deletion of the notion of an expected flow
Goods or services that are immediately consumed
Economic benefits available to all other parties
Risks and rewards of ownership
No practical ability to avoid
Interpreting 'no practical ability to avoid
Reporting the substance of contractual rights and obligations
Income and expenses defined in terms of changes in assets and liabilities
Types of income and expenses
a liability — as a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits;
expenses — as decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.
However, some aspects of those definitions caused confusion in practice because
the explicit reference in the definitions of an asset and a liability to the flows of economic benefits blurred the distinction between the economic resource or obligation and the resulting flows of economic benefits; and
In addition, some readers were unclear about the relationship between the terms 'expected' in the definitions and 'probable' in the recognition criteria.
To address these issues, and for the reasons given in paragraphs BC4.6–BC4.18, the Board revised the definitions to read as follows
an asset is a present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events;
a liability is a present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events; and
an economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits.
Supporting guidance for the definition of an asset is discussed in paragraphs BC4.23–BC4.43 and for the definition of a liability in paragraphs BC4.44–BC4.68.
This moved the references to future flows of economic benefits so that they now appear in the supporting definition of an economic resource instead of in the definitions of an asset and a liability.
The Board concluded that this separation would help to remove the confusion mentioned in paragraph BC4.3(a).
It emphasises more clearly that an asset (or liability) is an economic resource (or obligation) and that it is not the ultimate inflow (or outflow) of economic benefits that the economic resource (or obligation) may produce.
This approach also streamlines the definitions and shows more clearly the parallels between assets and liabilities.
References to that concept appear in the definition of an economic resource and in the guidance supporting the definition of a liability.
The Board replaced the notion of an expected inflow or outflow of resources for the following reasons
To avoid such confusion, the Board introduced the phrase 'has the potential to' in the definition of an economic resource.
BC4.11 The phrase 'has the potential to produce economic benefits' (or similarly 'has the potential to require a transfer of an economic resource') captures the following points
Those economic benefits must arise from some feature that already exists within the economic resource.
BC4.12 Some stakeholders stated that the Board should retain the notion of an expected inflow or outflow of resources.
They stated that users and preparers of financial statements do not regard an item as an asset if inflows of economic benefits are not expected or are not at least reasonably possible.
Those respondents argued that the revised definitions would considerably widen the range of items identified as assets and liabilities, which might lead to
pressure to identify every possible asset and liability, imposing a significant operational burden for little benefit if ultimately the asset or liability is not recognised or is measured at nil;
recognition as assets and liabilities of more items that are uncertain, improbable or hard to measure, unless the recognition criteria are made more robust;
a presumption that, in principle, all assets and liabilities should be recognised even if inflows or outflows are not expected; and
pressure to provide in the notes irrelevant information about unrecognised assets and liabilities for which inflows or outflows are unlikely.
In practice, an entity considers the definitions of an asset and a liability and recognition criteria at the same time to identify those assets and liabilities that the entity might need to recognise, or about which it might need to provide information in the notes.
the phrase 'as a result of past events' remains in the definitions of an asset and a liability; and
the word 'present' remains in the definition of a liability and is inserted in the definition of an asset.
Paragraphs BC4.64–BC4.68 discuss why the phrase 'as a result of past events' is particularly important to the revised definition of a liability.
Hence, the Board retained that phrase in the definitions.
BC4.18 If a past event created an asset or liability, that fact alone does not confirm that the asset or liability still exists: it is also necessary to consider whether the entity still controls a present economic resource or is still bound by a present obligation.
Thus, the Board also retained the reference to 'present' in the definition of a liability and added it to the definition of an asset.
to enable both the Board and stakeholders to assess implications of the proposals for future Standards; and
to help to identify any problems with the proposed definitions and supporting guidance.
identifying ways in which the proposed definitions and supporting guidance could help the Board to reach decisions in some of its current projects; and
These examples included rights and obligations that meet the definitions of an asset or a liability but have a low probability of inflows or outflows of economic benefits or have highly uncertain outcomes.
The analysis of those examples explained not only why an asset or liability exists, but also why, applying the recognition criteria in Chapter 5, that asset or liability would not necessarily be recognised in the financial statements.
The analysis of those examples illustrated how and why applying the proposed definitions and supporting guidance could, in many cases, lead to conclusions consistent with the requirements in the Standards.
In developing the revised definitions and supporting guidance, the Board considered this feedback together with other feedback received on the proposals.
economic resource (see paragraphs BC4.24–BC4.27);
focus on rights (see paragraphs BC4.28–BC4.39); and
BC4.24 Paragraphs BC4.6–BC4.7 explain the Board's decision to introduce a separate definition of an economic resource and paragraphs BC4.8–BC4.14 discuss the Board's decision to remove the notion of expected flows from the definition of an asset and not to include that notion in the definition of an economic resource.
BC4.25 The Board concluded that the definition of an asset should refer to the economic resource, not to the resulting economic benefits.
Although an asset derives its value from its potential to produce future economic benefits, what the entity controls is the present right that contains that potential.
The entity does not control the future economic benefits.
BC4.26 The Board considered whether to use the term 'resource' instead of 'economic resource'.
The Board intended that the term 'economic resource' cover all resources that have the potential to produce economic benefits rather than be limited to resources for which a market currently exists.
BC4.27 In some jurisdictions, the Board's Conceptual Framework is applied in the public sector and in other settings outside the financial markets, including the not-for-profit sector.
Consequently, some stakeholders stated that the definition of an asset should include resources that produce benefits other than cash flows, for example, social or environmental services or benefits to the reporting entity, to other parties or to wider society.
Similarly, the definition of a liability should, some stakeholders suggested, include obligations to transfer such benefits as well as obligations entered into for prudential or moral purposes, to meet expectations of a broader group of stakeholders or to maintain public support.
some assets, for example, tangible assets, are best described as resources instead of rights.
The concept of accounting for tangible assets as a set of rights is inconsistent with practice, they argued, especially when that concept is combined with the idea of 'unbundling' rights and recognising them as separate assets.
unless the Conceptual Framework explains what factors drive the identification of the unit of account, it would be difficult to explain consistently for a single asset comprising several rights whether to recognise that single asset as a whole or to recognise some of those rights separately.
a focus on rights within a larger set of rights would put more pressure on the recognition and derecognition criteria and the unit of account.
Entities would need to ask themselves numerous questions in order to confirm whether new assets or liabilities exist, without providing any clear benefit to users of financial statements.
These respondents argued that the rights approach has caused challenges in developing Standards and also in applying them, particularly in relation to derecognition decisions.
It is equally true that ownership of a physical object arises because of rights conferred by law.
Those paragraphs explain what constitutes 'core' goodwill and state that core goodwill meets the definition of an asset.
The Board concluded that if an asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights, it is likely to be easier to identify, measure and describe the asset.
This may affect whether recognising the asset would provide relevant information and whether it is possible to represent it faithfully.
However, the Board concluded that identifiability and separability should not form part of the definition of an asset.
The Board concluded that such items can be assets.
It considered whether the term 'right' was broad enough to capture such items, or whether the Board should instead define an economic resource by reference to a 'right or other source of value'.
BC4.36 The Board concluded that the notion of 'other sources of value' was too vague to be useful in a formal definition.
That right exists momentarily until the goods or services are consumed, at which point the consumption is recognised as an expense.
An alternative or additional reason could be that such rights are not controlled by the entity — the entity cannot deny other parties access to any economic benefits that may flow from those rights.
It also introduced a definition of control.
BC4.41 The Board considered whether the definition of an asset should incorporate the notion of exposure to risks and rewards of ownership.
Some Standards identify that exposure (or the related notion of exposure to variable returns) as either an aspect of control or an indicator of control
The Board did not move the reference to control into the asset recognition criteria because such a move would be unlikely to change which assets would be recognised and because the Board has identified no problems in practice that would be addressed by such a move.
The entity would not need the right to obtain all, or even substantially all, the economic benefits from the building because its asset is not a right over the whole building.
The question of whether to include a threshold such as 'substantially all' may arise when developing Standards, for example, if a Standard requires an entity to account for a group of rights as a single asset (a single unit of account).
The main changes from the previous definition are as follows
deletion of the reference to an expected outflow of economic benefits.
replacement of the phrase 'resources embodying economic benefits' with the new defined term 'economic resource' (see paragraphs BC4.6–BC4.7).
the entity has an obligation (see paragraphs BC4.47–BC4.61);
the obligation is to transfer an economic resource (see paragraphs BC4.62–BC4.63); and
the obligation is a present obligation that exists as a result of past events (see paragraphs BC4.64–BC4.68).
However, in some other situations an entity has some limited ability to avoid a future transfer.
Both in developing Standards and in applying them, problems had arisen because it was unclear how limited that ability must be for an entity to have a 'present obligation'.
an entity does not have a legally enforceable obligation to transfer an economic resource, but its ability to avoid the transfer is limited by its customary practices, published policies or specific statements (such obligations are sometimes referred to as 'constructive obligations'); or
a requirement already exists for an entity to transfer an economic resource, but the outcome of that requirement is conditional on the action that the entity itself may take.
However, the factors used to assess whether an entity has the practical ability to avoid a particular transfer would depend on the nature of the entity's duty or responsibility and would be considered when developing Standards.
It is sufficient that, as a consequence of a past event, the entity may have to transfer an economic resource if further conditions are met.
That omission would place too much emphasis on legal form and not enough weight on faithfully representing the substance of obligations that are, in practice, as binding as obligations that are legally enforceable.
Moreover, if an entity has a theoretical right to take action that would avoid an obligation, but has no practical ability to exercise that right, that obligation binds the entity as effectively as if it did not have that theoretical right.
BC4.53 The Board rejected a suggestion made by several stakeholders to apply a threshold based on the probability of future outflows.
Those respondents suggested that an entity should be regarded as having an obligation if it were probable or, perhaps, reasonably certain that the entity would transfer an economic resource.
They argued that such a threshold would provide the most relevant measure of the expenses in the period.
The supporting guidance focuses on what an entity is obliged to do — not on the likelihood of the possible outcomes.
Applying the criterion of 'no practical ability to avoid' will require judgement.
Some stakeholders were concerned that allowing preparers of financial statements to apply this criterion would lead to diverse practice and that in some circumstances entities would recognise a liability when, in the view of some of those stakeholders, the entity does not have a genuine obligation.
However, the Board noted that preparers of financial statements will rarely be required to apply that criterion without further requirements and guidance.
The Board will, if necessary, develop guidance on applying that criterion to particular cases as it develops Standards.
This is intended to mean not just that it would be economically advantageous to make the transfer.
Rather, the adverse economic consequences of not making the transfer are so severe that the entity has no practical ability to avoid the transfer.
Although the entity has the theoretical right to avoid the transfer, it has no practical ability to exercise that right.
BC4.56 The Board considered whether phrases such as the following could be easier to interpret than 'no practical ability to avoid
little or no discretion (in practice) to avoid'.
The Board chose the phrase 'no practical ability to avoid' because it most effectively conveys the need to identify what an entity is obliged to do, instead of focusing on the probable outcome.
The Board concluded that the counterparty does control an asset in such cases.
It concluded that in the case of such obligations a corresponding right is controlled by society at large — the people living in the area.
They have the right to receive the services required to restore their environment.
Paragraphs BC4.8–BC4.14 explain why the Board replaced the notion that an outflow of resources is expected with the concept that a liability has the potential to require a transfer of an economic resource.
That would be the case if the obligation is a present obligation that has arisen as a result of the past events discussed in paragraphs BC4.64–BC4.68.
Such obligations are sometimes referred to as 'stand-ready obligations'.
BC4.65 Some obligations arise from a single obligating event, for example, receiving goods.
Other obligations build up over time through a continuous obligating event, for example, conducting a continuous activity.
BC4.66 In some cases, a chain of events creates an obligation.
In such cases, identifying which of those events (reaching the threshold or operating on the specified date) is the obligating event can be particularly difficult.
Therefore, it is important to explain which of the events in the chain must have occurred for an entity to have a present obligation 'as a result of past events'.
BC4.68 The Board concluded that the concept 'as a result of past events' means that
The activity increases the magnitude of the economic resources that the entity will or may have to transfer.
Indeed, some guidance — in particular, the guidance supporting the liability definition — was developed with significant thought given to non-reciprocal transactions.
BC4.70 The Board concluded that its guidance supporting the definitions of an asset and a liability is equally suitable for reciprocal exchange transactions and non-reciprocal transactions.
In both cases, the starting point is to identify the rights and obligations arising from the transaction.
The items in category (a) may be liabilities but are subject to existence uncertainty.
It often refers to an item that may give rise to an outflow of economic resources if some uncertain future event occurs.
Depending on the circumstances, an obligating event might or might not have occurred.
If an obligating event has occurred, the item might be a liability subject to existence uncertainty, outcome uncertainty, measurement uncertainty or any combination of those uncertainties.
The liability might be recognised or unrecognised.
Likewise, selecting a unit of account without considering how recognition or measurement requirements would apply may not result in useful information.
In the Board's view, it is possible for items to qualify for recognition on an individual basis and to be measured on a group basis.
For example, a collection of items qualifying for recognition on an individual basis
could be measured as a single unit of account when estimating their recoverable amount; or
may sometimes, as a practical expedient, be measured as a portfolio.
BC4.76 Decisions about the unit of account are linked to decisions about recognition and measurement that are made in developing Standards.
Hence, the Board concluded that decisions about selecting a unit of account will need to be made in developing Standards, not in the Conceptual Framework.
The Board did not rank the factors by priority because their relative importance depends on the specific features of the item for which the entity is accounting.
In the Board's view, no single ranking could be used to determine the most useful unit of account consistently for a broad range of Standards.
When the entity transfers the goods to the customer, it simultaneously receives a right to receive payment from the customer.
At that time, the customer receives the goods and incurs an obligation to pay for them.
BC4.82 The Board considered whether the combined right and obligation to exchange economic resources could give a reporting entity both a separate asset (a right to exchange resources, equivalent to a purchased option) and a separate liability (the obligation to exchange resources, equivalent to a written option).
Conversely, the issuer of the written option undertakes the obligation to make the exchange, if the holder exercises its right.
However, if an entity is both the holder of a purchased option and the issuer of an identical written option for the same underlying exchange of economic resources
the entity's right under its purchased option to withdraw from the exchange is nullified by its obligation to exchange if the counterparty exercises its right under the entity's written option; and
the counterparty's right under the entity's written option to withdraw from the exchange is nullified by its obligation to exchange if the entity exercises its right under its purchased option.
BC4.84 Consequently, if an entity is both the holder of a purchased option and the issuer of a written option for the same underlying exchange on the same terms, neither party has the right to avoid exchanging economic resources.
Moreover, the entity's right and obligation to exchange economic resources are so interdependent that they cannot be separated.
Hence, the contract cannot be separated into more than a single asset or liability.
Once the lessor has performed its obligation to deliver that right, the lease contract is no longer an executory contract.
The lessee controls the right-of-use asset and has a liability for the lease payments.
Trade date accounting treats the financial asset as having already been delivered at the commitment (trade) date, instead of accounting for the purchase or sale contract as a derivative until settlement.
In other words, permitting this method results from considering the cost constraint — from considering the relative costs and benefits of trade date accounting and settlement date accounting (the other method permitted by IFRS 9).
The Board will set recognition requirements for executory contracts in developing Standards in the same way it sets recognition requirements for other assets and liabilities.
BC4.87 In the light of stakeholders' concerns, the Board considered whether the revised concepts on executory contracts could result in more assets and liabilities arising from executory contracts being recognised.
In many cases in current practice, an asset or liability is not recognised for an executory contract.
The Board expects that this will continue to be so.
Those concepts drew on concepts developed by the Board in standard-setting projects.
to make a binary distinction between liabilities and equity;
to define equity as the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities; and
BC4.90 The Board considered whether continuing to make a binary distinction between liabilities and equity is sufficient to provide users of financial statements with useful information about claims against the entity.
The inherent limitation of a binary distinction between liabilities and equity is that it attempts to make a single distinction between claims that have various characteristics in varying degrees.
Eliminating that binary distinction and defining a single element for all claims would allow the accounting for each type of claim to be determined individually to depict its specific characteristics.
Moreover, it is not possible to measure all claims directly without valuing the entire entity, which goes beyond the stated objective of general purpose financial reports.
However, the Board concluded that introducing another element would make the classification and resulting accounting more complex.
An outcome similar to introducing a new element could instead be achieved by separately presenting different classes within liabilities or within equity.
will consider approaches to distinguishing liabilities from equity, including approaches that could require changes to the definitions of a liability or equity in the Conceptual Framework.
The Board will use the output from that project when it decides, in due course, whether to add to its active agenda a project to amend the relevant Standards, the Conceptual Framework, or both.
Any decision to start an active project would require the Board to go through its due process for adding a project to its agenda.
That guidance was not designed to help to distinguish liabilities from equity (see paragraph BC4.45).
BC4.94 The Board disagreed with these arguments, concluding that
Hence, when making decisions about recognition, measurement and presentation and disclosure, the Board considers whether the resulting information provides useful information about both an entity's financial position and its financial performance.
Hence, much of financial reporting is currently based on transactions and will continue to be so.
Consequently, identifying income and expenses necessarily leads to identifying which assets and liabilities have changed.
They refer to real economic phenomena (economic resources and obligations to transfer economic resources).
A statement of financial position depicting assets, liabilities and equity provides users with more relevant and understandable information about an entity's financial position than does a mere summary of amounts that have arisen as by-products of a matching process.
However, an intention to match income and expenses does not justify the recognition in the statement of financial position of items that do not meet the definitions of an asset or a liability.
BC4.95 The Board noted that no major problems had been identified with the definitions of income and expenses.
The material was originally included to emphasise that income includes revenue and gains and that expenses include losses.
The Board decided that that emphasis is now unnecessary and the implication that the Conceptual Framework defines subclasses of income and expenses is unhelpful.
The Board does not expect the removal of that material to cause any changes in practice.
the item has a cost or value that can be measured with reliability.
For example, applying the criterion could prevent the recognition of some derivative financial instruments.
Moreover, it could result in a gain being recognised for a transaction when no economic gain has occurred.
For example, suppose that, in exchange for receiving cash, an entity incurs a liability to pay a fixed amount if some unlikely event occurs in the future.
If the liability is not recognised because an outflow of economic benefits is not considered probable when the entity receives the cash, the entity will recognise an immediate gain at that time.
In practice, a 'reliable' measure was usually interpreted as one with a tolerable level of measurement uncertainty and perhaps also as verifiable and free from error.
relevant information about the asset or liability and about any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity; and
a faithful representation of the asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity.
This would have meant that if the Board had decided that recognition of a particular item would not provide useful information, it would have had to include an exception to this principle in particular Standards.
The Board rejected that approach because it expects that in some circumstances it will continue to conclude that recognising particular assets or particular liabilities will not provide useful information or that the costs of recognising them would exceed the benefits of doing so.
To be useful to the Board, the Conceptual Framework needs to give guidance on how to approach decisions about setting recognition requirements in Standards.
A presumption or overarching principle that every item meeting the definition of an asset or a liability should be recognised would be too restrictive and would not provide such guidance.
These stakeholders suggested that the Board needs more concrete and robust recognition criteria to ensure that it develops Standards with consistent requirements that result in useful information.
In the Board's view, setting more rigid recognition criteria in the Conceptual Framework would not help the Board to set recognition requirements in Standards that result in useful information to users of financial statements at a cost that does not exceed the benefits.
Some stakeholders disagreed with the revised approach to recognition because they were concerned that it could increase the range of recognised assets and liabilities.
BC5.10 In developing the revised recognition criteria, the Board aimed to develop tools that would help it to base decisions on a more coherent set of principles.
It did not have an objective of either increasing or decreasing the range of assets and liabilities recognised.
Paragraphs BC5.15–BC5.20 provide the Board's responses to specific concerns in relation to situations when probability of inflows or outflows of economic benefits is low and paragraphs BC5.21–BC5.22 provide the Board's responses to specific concerns in relation to measurement uncertainty.
BC5.12 The guidance supporting the revised recognition criteria provides examples of factors that may indicate when recognising an asset or liability may fail to provide users of financial statements with relevant information.
it is uncertain whether an asset or liability exists (see paragraphs BC5.13–BC5.14); or
an asset or liability exists, but the probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits is low (see paragraphs BC5.15–BC5.20).
BC5.13 It is sometimes uncertain whether an asset or liability exists (existence uncertainty).
The Board concluded that it is helpful to consider existence uncertainty separately from outcome uncertainty and separately from measurement uncertainty.
Although existence uncertainty may contribute to outcome uncertainty and measurement uncertainty, conceptually it is different and could affect recognition decisions differently.
Distinguishing different types of uncertainty makes it easier to decide what information is most likely to be relevant to users of financial statements and how to provide that information in a way that provides a faithful representation.
the probability criterion had proved to be a practical way of applying the qualitative characteristics.
The proposed supporting guidance on items with a low probability of generating a flow of economic benefits was not clear enough and would lead to doubt and inconsistency.
Recognising such assets and liabilities would not provide useful information.
In addition, preparers of financial statements might have to search extensively for rights and obligations.
(The deletion of the notion of an 'expected' flow is discussed in paragraphs BC4.8–BC4.14.)
if assets and liabilities with a low probability of future inflows and outflows were recognised, they might have to be measured at amounts based on expected value.
Such measurement is difficult and puts a burden on preparers of financial statements.
Sometimes, providing information about the range and distribution of possible outcomes is more useful than providing a measure based on expected value.
Such measures may provide an illusion of precision that does not exist.
BC5.16 Some respondents suggested applying a probability filter for some assets or liabilities (for example, for patents or research and development), but not for all (for example, not for derivative financial assets), or for some transactions but not for others (for example, not for the acquisition of an asset for cash).
Those respondents suggested it is not reasonable to remove the probability requirement from the recognition criteria simply to permit the recognition of some financial instruments.
Including an exception for particular financial instruments in a Standard would be sufficient to achieve that result.
BC5.17 The Board acknowledged that a probability threshold could be a practical way to filter out assets and liabilities whose recognition might not provide relevant information.
However, this approach would lead to not recognising assets and liabilities in some cases when recognition could provide relevant information.
It would also be difficult to set a probability threshold that could be applied across all Standards and in all recognition events.
BC5.20 Some stakeholders expressed a concern that the term 'low probability' is too subjective to be interpreted consistently.
However, the Board's objective in discussing situations of low probability was to indicate that in some such situations, the Board might conclude that some information may not be relevant.
The Board's objective was not to identify a threshold above which information would always be relevant and below which it would always be irrelevant.
The Board concluded that a high level of measurement uncertainty would not necessarily preclude a measure from providing useful information about an asset or liability, so it would be difficult to set a single threshold based on measurement uncertainty that could be applied across all Standards and in all recognition events.
They described this as an application of prudence (asymmetric prudence, applying the terminology used in paragraph BC2.37).
Paragraphs BC2.44–BC2.45 provide further discussion of symmetry in decisions about recognition and measurement.
Thus, an entity derecognises an asset or liability when it no longer meets the criteria for recognition (or no longer exists, or is no longer an asset or liability of the entity).
the change in the entity's assets and liabilities as a result of that transaction or other event.
If an entity transfers an entire asset or an entire liability and retains no exposure to that asset or liability, the control approach and the risks-and-rewards approach both lead to the same outcome.
Moreover, in such cases, achieving both aims described in paragraph BC5.26 is straightforward.
BC5.28 In contrast, the Board has encountered difficulties in standard-setting when an entity transfers only part of an asset or liability or retains some exposure to variations.
The Board views both aims as valid.
continuing to recognise the retained component, if any.
present any retained component separately in the statement of financial position;
as a last resort, if derecognition of the transferred component is not sufficient to achieve both aims described in paragraph BC5.26 even when supported by separate presentation or by explanatory information, considering whether continuing to recognise the transferred component would achieve those aims.
That continued recognition would need to be supported by separate presentation or explanatory information because financial statements would include as assets and liabilities, and as related income and expenses, items that do not meet the definition of an element of financial statements.
BC5.30 The Board considered whether the description of aims of accounting requirements for derecognition should explicitly refer to the qualitative characteristic of relevance in addition to the qualitative characteristic of faithful representation.
The Board noted that the aims described in paragraph BC5.26 identify what economic phenomena need to be represented faithfully when derecognition is being considered.
In the Board's view, information about those economic phenomena is what would be relevant to users of financial statements.
describes measurement bases and the information they provide; and
discusses the factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis.
These respondents suggested that the Board should undertake further research on measurement and either
delay issuing a revised Conceptual Framework until that research is completed;
issue a revised Conceptual Framework without a measurement section; or
develop high-level interim guidance on measurement for use until more complete concepts and principles can be developed.
The Board rejected these suggestions.
The Board concluded that a separate measurement objective is unlikely to provide useful additional guidance to help it to develop measurement requirements.
The main advantages of using a single measurement basis would be
the amounts included in the financial statements could be more meaningfully added, subtracted and compared; and
the financial statements would be less complex and, arguably, more understandable.
In addition, if the Board were to identify a concept of wealth or capital that would meet the information needs of users of financial statements, a single measurement basis would be required in order to produce a measure of that wealth or capital.
Nearly all respondents who commented on this issue supported the suggested approach.
Most of the respondents who suggested the use of a single measurement basis conceded that this could not be achieved in practice, at least in the short term.
In addition, in different circumstances, a particular measurement basis may be
easier to understand and implement than another;
more verifiable, less prone to error or subject to a lower level of measurement uncertainty than another; or
less costly to implement than another.
The Board did not find such a distinction useful when describing or selecting a measurement basis for use in a particular Standard because the difference between entry and exit values in the same market is often small, except for transaction costs (see paragraphs BC6.30–BC6.33).
Identifying that information will help to identify whether a particular measurement basis is likely to provide useful information to the users of financial statements in particular circumstances.
That term is used, for example, when that economic value may differ from the amount of a future cash payment or future cash receipt, for example, because of factors such as the time value of money.
The historical cost of a liability when it is incurred or taken on is initially the value of the consideration received to incur or take on the liability minus transaction costs.
When developing Standards, the Board will decide whether to specify how those initial values are determined.
If the asset is measured at historical cost, this derecognition is reflected through depreciation or amortisation of the asset.
Similarly, fulfilment of all or part of a liability leads to derecognition of the part of the liability that is fulfilled.
BC6.21 If an asset has become impaired or a liability has become onerous, the cost determined at initial recognition is unlikely to provide relevant information if it is not updated.
However, historical cost does not reflect changes in value of an asset that is not impaired or of a liability that is not onerous.
BC6.22 The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability reflects estimates of future cash flows discounted at a rate that is not updated after initial recognition, unless the asset or liability bears interest at a variable rate.
For loans given or received, if interest is receivable or payable regularly, the amortised cost of the loan typically approximates the amount originally paid or received.
In addition, the carrying amount of a loan given is reduced if it is impaired.
It states that current measurement bases include fair value, value in use (for assets), fulfilment value (for liabilities) and current cost.
The description of current cost is derived from descriptions of current cost in various academic sources.
In those Standards, value in use is used in determining the recoverable amount of an asset that is measured at historical cost and may be impaired.
Within that context, if value in use is used to determine the recoverable amount of an impaired asset, immediately after the impairment loss has been recognised, the carrying amount of the asset equals its value in use.
Similarly, the relief value of a liability is the benefit that an entity would enjoy if it were relieved of the liability being measured.
The Board did not include a discussion of deprival value or relief value because they are more complex than other measurement bases and have been used in few jurisdictions.
Hence, the Board concluded that it is unlikely to use deprival value or relief value when developing Standards.
The Board concluded that it is unnecessary to describe net realisable value separately, because it is derived from another current measure.
BC6.30 Transaction costs can arise both when
an asset is acquired or a liability is incurred or taken on; and
an asset is sold or disposed of or a liability is settled or transferred.
They have normally been defined in particular Standards as incremental costs, other than the transaction price, that would not have been incurred if the particular asset (or liability) being measured had not been acquired (incurred) or sold or disposed of (transferred or settled).
the historical cost and current cost of an asset or liability reflect those transaction costs.
Although the transaction costs are not part of the transaction price, the entity could not have acquired the asset or incurred the liability without incurring those transaction costs.
if the measure is intended to depict the fair value, fulfilment value or value in use of an asset or liability, the measure does not reflect those transaction costs.
Those costs do not affect the current value of that asset or liability.
value in use and fulfilment value reflect those transaction costs if the entity expects to incur them;
fair value does not reflect those transaction costs; and
historical cost and current cost do not reflect transaction costs that would be incurred in selling or disposing of an asset or in settling or transferring a liability because these measurement bases are entry values — they reflect the costs of acquiring the asset or incurring the liability.
BC6.34 To meet the objective of financial statements, information provided by a particular measurement basis must be useful to users of financial statements.
A measurement basis achieves this if it provides information that is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent.
BC6.35 The Board considered whether to prescribe the order in which factors should be considered in selecting a measurement basis (for example, using a hierarchy or decision tree).
Indeed, in many cases it will be important to consider several factors when selecting a measurement basis.
However, the Board concluded that the relative importance of the information produced in those statements will depend on how users will use the resulting information in their analysis, which will, in turn, depend on facts and circumstances.
characteristics of the asset or liability; and
contribution to future cash flows (see paragraphs BC6.38–BC6.42).
For example, depending on the nature of an entity's business activities, the same asset could be sold as inventory, leased to another entity or used in the entity's business.
In addition, the Board noted that, in many cases, the nature of an entity's business activities is a matter of fact, not an opinion or management intent.
When this is not the case, the Board will need to consider how to address any subjectivity.
whether the assets and liabilities are related in some way; and
measurement uncertainty (see paragraphs BC6.44–BC6.45).
Some respondents used the term 'reliability' to describe that factor.
As discussed in paragraphs BC2.28–BC2.31, the Board did not reintroduce the term 'reliability'.
The Board disagreed with this view, concluding that the tolerable level of measurement uncertainty depends on facts and circumstances and can be decided only when developing Standards.
verifiability should play a more significant role in selecting a measurement basis; and
comparability could be enhanced if the Board, when developing Standards, prevented preparers of financial statements from choosing between measurement bases.
BC6.51 One way in which such information could be provided is to use a current measurement basis for an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to use a different measurement basis for the related income or expenses in the statement of profit or loss.
In such cases, the difference between the income or expenses included in the statement of profit or loss and the change in current value of the asset or liability is included in other comprehensive income.
measuring a class of equity or a component of equity directly would be inappropriate because equity is defined as a residual interest; and
it would be inconsistent with the reporting entity perspective because dividing total equity between classes and into components would result in the reporting of items that do not have a financial effect on the reporting entity as a whole.
BC6.54 Although the total carrying amount of equity (total equity) is measured as a residual, the Board noted that equity is defined as a type of claim — a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities.
Measuring some classes of equity, or some components of equity, directly does not contradict that definition and differs from measuring total equity directly.
Even if some individual classes or components of equity are measured directly, total equity will continue to equal the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised assets minus the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised liabilities.
BC6.55 The Board also concluded that the direct measurement of some individual classes of equity or components of equity would not contradict the entity perspective adopted in financial statements.
Such information would not be provided from the perspective of a particular claimholder.
Approach to guidance on presentation and disclosure of income and expenses
Reclassifying items into the statement of profit or loss
A particular issue identified was providing information about an entity's financial performance, including the use of other comprehensive income.
concepts that describe how information should be presented and disclosed in financial statements.
Those concepts will guide the Board in setting presentation and disclosure requirements in Standards and may guide entities in providing information in financial statements.
a Disclosure Initiative, a collection of implementation and research projects aimed at improving disclosure in financial statements by providing additional guidance that builds on the presentation and disclosure concepts set out in the Conceptual Framework.
a research project on primary financial statements.
The Board may explore enhancements to the statement of changes in equity or other enhancements to presentation or disclosure requirements as part of its research project on Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Equity.
Some respondents suggested that the term 'other comprehensive income' is neither particularly descriptive nor well understood by users of financial statements.
Those decisions were made for particular reasons in particular projects, not for a single consistently applied conceptual reason.
BC7.11 The Board decided it was important for the Conceptual Framework to include some discussion of this topic.
how to define or describe profit or loss (see paragraphs BC7.15–BC7.20);
how to decide which income and expenses are included in the statement of profit or loss and which income and expenses are included in other comprehensive income (see paragraphs BC7.21–BC7.25); and
whether and when the amounts included in other comprehensive income should be reclassified into the statement of profit or loss (see paragraphs BC7.26–BC7.33).
The Board concluded that it had made significant progress in developing high-level guidance on presentation of income and expenses and that this guidance would help the Board to develop presentation requirements in Standards.
That decision will not preclude further work on reporting financial performance.
the statement of profit or loss as the primary source of information about an entity's financial performance for the reporting period; and
the total or subtotal for profit or loss as a highly summarised depiction of the entity's financial performance for the period.
However, on the basis of its previous work the Board concluded that no single characteristic, or small number of characteristics, is shared by all items included in the statement of profit or loss but not shared by items that are most appropriately included in other comprehensive income.
Consequently, the Board concluded that it is not possible to produce a robust conceptual definition of profit or loss or of other comprehensive income.
BC7.18 The Board also concluded that it could not create a prescriptive list of all categories of items that are most appropriately included in the statement of profit or loss.
Such a list could never be complete and would inevitably lead to reporting in other comprehensive income some, perhaps many, items that would generally be regarded as being more appropriately included in the statement of profit or loss.
BC7.19 A number of stakeholders repeatedly asked the Board to define profit or loss.
A few of them provided suggestions for how to develop such a definition or for distinguishing income and expenses to be included in the statement of profit or loss from income and expenses to be included in other comprehensive income.
However, no consensus on a viable approach emerged.
The Board concluded that introducing guidance on this topic was a significant improvement.
BC7.21 As mentioned in paragraph BC7.17, the Board did not identify a single characteristic or a single set of characteristics shared by all items that are most appropriately included in the statement of profit or loss.
As mentioned in paragraph BC7.15, that description states that the statement of profit or loss is the primary source of information about an entity's financial performance for the reporting period.
If that statement is the primary source of that information, excluding income and expenses from that statement without compelling reasons could make that statement less useful.
The Board's intention in establishing this principle was to emphasise that the statement of profit or loss is the default location for income and expenses.
BC7.26 The Board considered whether items of income and expenses included in other comprehensive income should be subsequently reclassified into the statement of profit or loss.
Such reclassification is sometimes referred to as 'recycling'.
The differences between these requirements arose because the Board had taken different approaches to the issue at different times.
To be consistent with that approach, the Board generally prohibited reclassification in Standards it developed at those times.
At other times, the Board's approach was that all income and expenses should be included in the statement of profit or loss at some point.
To achieve that objective, reclassification would be necessary.
BC7.29 The Board concluded that if the statement of profit or loss is the primary source of information about an entity's financial performance for the period, the cumulative amounts included in that statement over time need to be as complete as possible.
Hence, income and expenses can be permanently excluded from the statement of profit or loss only if there is a compelling reason in that particular case.
The reporting period in which reclassification takes place is the period when doing so results in the statement of profit or loss providing more relevant information or providing a more faithful representation of the entity's financial performance for that period.
When this approach is used, reclassification is the only way to ensure that, over the holding period of the asset or liability, the cumulative amount of income or expenses included in the statement of profit or loss for that asset or liability is the amount determined using the measurement basis selected for that statement.
BC7.32 In some cases, it might not be possible to identify any period when reclassifying income and expenses into the statement of profit or loss would have the result described in paragraph BC7.30.
In such cases, without an appropriate, non-arbitrary basis for reclassification, reclassification would not provide useful information.
Entities cannot take that decision.
Those concepts are important to financial reporting and influence the definitions of income and expenses, the selection of measurement bases, and presentation and disclosure decisions.
The Board may decide to revisit the concepts of capital and capital maintenance in the future if it considers such a revision necessary.
The term 'reliability' was used instead of 'faithful representation', but the meaning was intended to be similar.
non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
CLASSIFICATION OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS (OR DISPOSAL GROUPS) AS HELD FOR SALE OR AS HELD FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OWNERS
Non-current assets that are to be abandoned
Measurement of a non-current asset (or disposal group)
Recognition of impairment losses and reversals
Changes to a plan of sale or to a plan of distribution to owners
Gains or losses relating to continuing operations
In particular, the IFRS requires
assets that meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale to be presented separately in the statement of financial position and the results of discontinued operations to be presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Assets of a class that an entity would normally regard as non-current that are acquired exclusively with a view to resale shall not be classified as current unless they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with this IFRS.
If a non-current asset within the scope of the measurement requirements of this IFRS is part of a disposal group, the measurement requirements of this IFRS apply to the group as a whole, so that the group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The classification, presentation and measurement requirements in this IFRS applicable to a non-current asset (or disposal group) that is classified as held for sale apply also to a non-current asset (or disposal group) that is classified as held for distribution to owners acting in their capacity as owners (held for distribution to owners).
This IFRS specifies the disclosures required in respect of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or discontinued operations.
Disclosures in other IFRSs do not apply to such assets (or disposal groups) unless those IFRSs require
Further, the asset (or disposal group) must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value.
The probability of shareholders' approval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as part of the assessment of whether the sale is highly probable.
An extension of the period required to complete a sale does not preclude an asset (or disposal group) from being classified as held for sale if the delay is caused by events or circumstances beyond the entity's control and there is sufficient evidence that the entity remains committed to its plan to sell the asset (or disposal group).
This will be the case when the criteria in Appendix B are met.
However, when those criteria are met after the reporting period but before the authorisation of the financial statements for issue, the entity shall disclose the information specified in paragraph 41(a), (b) and (d) in the notes.
A non-current asset (or disposal group) is classified as held for distribution to owners when the entity is committed to distribute the asset (or disposal group) to the owners.
For this to be the case, the assets must be available for immediate distribution in their present condition and the distribution must be highly probable.
Actions required to complete the distribution should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the distribution will be made or that the distribution will be withdrawn.
The probability of shareholders' approval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as part of the assessment of whether the distribution is highly probable.
This is because its carrying amount will be recovered principally through continuing use.
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) to be abandoned include non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are to be used to the end of their economic life and non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are to be closed rather than sold.
Measurement of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale
An entity shall measure a non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for distribution to owners at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute.
Hence, if the asset (or disposal group) is acquired as part of a business combination, it shall be measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Any increase in the present value of the costs to sell that arises from the passage of time shall be presented in profit or loss as a financing cost.
not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss that has been recognised, either in accordance with this IFRS or previously in accordance with IAS 36, on the non-current assets that are within the scope of the measurement requirements of this IFRS.
Requirements relating to derecognition are set out in
Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale shall continue to be recognised.
Financial statements for the periods since classification as held for sale or as held for distribution to owners shall be amended accordingly if the disposal group or non-current asset that ceases to be classified as held for sale or as held for distribution to owners is a subsidiary, joint operation, joint venture, associate, or a portion of an interest in a joint venture or an associate.
If an entity removes an individual asset or liability from a disposal group classified as held for distribution to owners, the remaining assets and liabilities of the disposal group to be distributed shall continue to be measured as a group only if the group meets the criteria in paragraph 12A.
Otherwise, the remaining non-current assets of the group that individually meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale (or as held for distribution to owners) shall be measured individually at the lower of their carrying amounts and fair values less costs to sell (or costs to distribute) at that date.

The need to change previous accounting and history of the project
The differences in accounting treatment across jurisdictions and products made it difficult for investors and analysts to understand and compare insurers' results.
Most stakeholders, including insurers, agreed on the need for a common global insurance accounting standard even though opinions varied as to what it should be.
Long-duration and complex insurance risks are difficult to reflect in the measurement of insurance contracts.
In addition, insurance contracts are not typically traded in markets and may include a significant investment component, posing further measurement challenges.
To address these issues, the Board undertook a project to make insurers' financial statements more useful and insurance accounting practices consistent across jurisdictions.
made limited improvements to then existing accounting practices for insurance contracts; and
required an entity to disclose information about insurance contracts.
As a result, there was wide diversity in the financial reporting of insurance contracts across entities applying IFRS Standards, and within some entities' financial statements.
In addition, some of that financial reporting did not provide useful information about those contracts to users of financial statements.
It is a comprehensive Standard for accounting for insurance contracts.
It is the result of the proposals set out in the following consultation documents previously published by the Board
These activities helped the Board to understand the concerns and challenges that arose for some entities while implementing the Standard.
unduly disrupt implementation already under way.
The Board considered whether the following approaches could be used to account for insurance contracts
applying generally applicable IFRS Standards (see paragraphs BC9–BC12); and
selecting an existing model for accounting for insurance contracts (see paragraphs BC13–BC15).
The paragraphs that follow explain why the Board rejected these approaches and developed a new Standard for insurance contracts.
Insurance contracts are excluded from the scope of many existing IFRS Standards that might otherwise apply to such contracts, including Standards on
If the Board extended the scope of existing IFRS Standards to include insurance contracts, an entity would need to
identify service components and investment components within each premium that it receives.
The Board decided that it would be difficult for an entity to routinely separate components of an insurance contract, and setting requirements to do so would result in complexity.
Such separation would also ignore interdependencies between components, with the result that the sum of the values of the components may not always equal the value of the contract as a whole, even on initial recognition.
But the Board also decided that
apply the financial instruments Standards to the investment component.
measure the investment components at fair value through profit or loss or at amortised cost, as applicable.
This is discussed in paragraphs BC165–BC166.
For investment components measured at amortised cost, incremental transaction costs relating to the investment component would reduce the initial carrying amount of that liability.
Overall, applying generally applicable IFRS Standards would provide useful information for users of financial statements and would be relatively easy to apply to insurance contracts for which there is no significant variability in outcomes and no significant investment component.
However, simply applying generally applicable Standards would be difficult and would produce information of limited relevance for other types of insurance contracts.
In those cases, the problems created by interdependencies are less significant.
The requirements for separating and measuring non-insurance components of an insurance contract are discussed in paragraphs BC98–BC114.
The Board rejected this suggestion because such an approach would be based on the type of entity issuing the contract and on numerous standards developed at different times.
In addition, although US GAAP is widely used as a basis for accounting for insurance contracts, it was developed in the context of US insurance products and the US regulatory environment.
The Board also decided that it would be inappropriate to account for insurance contracts using other national insurance accounting models because many such models
do not use current estimates of all cash flows;
require no explicit risk measurement, even though risk is the essence of insurance;
fail to reflect the time value or the intrinsic value of some or all embedded options and guarantees, or else they measure time value or intrinsic value in a way that is inconsistent with current market prices;
present an entity's financial performance, particularly for life insurance, in a manner difficult for users of financial statements to understand.
However, the Board noted that
Overview of the approach taken in the Standard
In addition, many insurance contracts generate cash flows with substantial variability over a long period.
To provide useful information about these features, the Board developed an approach that
combines current measurement of the future cash flows with the recognition of profit over the period that services are provided under the contract (see paragraphs BC18–BC26);
requires an entity to make an accounting policy choice at a portfolio level of whether to recognise all insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss or to recognise some of that income or expenses in other comprehensive income (see paragraphs BC38–BC49).
The Board developed this approach rather than a fair value model.
However, many stakeholders suggested that such an approach places too much emphasis on hypothetical transactions that rarely happen.
An insurance contract typically combines features of a financial instrument and a service contract in such a way that those components are interrelated.
Hence, the Board concluded that entities should not unbundle the components and account for them separately, except as discussed in paragraphs BC98–BC114.
Instead, the Board developed requirements to account for both the financial and service components without unbundling them.
Measurement at current value is consistent with the requirements for comparable financial instruments.
a current risk-adjusted present value that incorporates all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the future cash flows, in a way that is consistent with observable market information (the fulfilment cash flows (see paragraphs BC19–BC20)); and
an amount representing the unearned profit in the contracts relating to services still to be provided (the contractual service margin (see paragraphs BC21–BC26)).
The current value of the fulfilment cash flows allocated to a group of insurance contracts includes
a current, unbiased estimate of the future cash flows expected to fulfil the insurance contracts.
The estimate of future cash flows reflects the perspective of the entity, provided that the estimates of any relevant market variables are consistent with the observable market prices for those variables (see paragraphs BC147–BC184N).
an adjustment for the time value of money and the financial risks associated with the future cash flows, to the extent that the financial risks are not included in the estimate of the future cash flows.
For example, if the cash flows being discounted are an estimate of the probability-weighted average (the mean), that mean itself does not include an adjustment for risk, and any financial risk (ie uncertainty relating to financial risk on whether the ultimate cash flows will equal the mean) will be included in the discount rate (a risk-adjusted rate).
If, in contrast, the cash flows being discounted are an estimate of the mean with an adjustment to reflect uncertainty related to financial risk, the discount rate will be a rate that reflects only the time value of money (ie not adjusted for risk).
The discount rates are consistent with observable current market prices for instruments whose cash flow characteristics are consistent with the estimates of the cash flows of the insurance contracts.
The discount rates also exclude the effects of any factors that influence observable market prices but are not relevant to the estimates of the cash flows of the insurance contracts (see paragraphs BC185–BC205B).
an adjustment for the effects of non-financial risk, referred to as a risk adjustment for non-financial risk.
The risk adjustment for non-financial risk is defined as the compensation that the entity requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk (see paragraphs BC206–BC217).
The underlying objective of the Board's approach to the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows is to achieve consistent measurement with current market information when possible.
That market-consistent measurement includes any options and guarantees embedded in the insurance contracts.
The Board decided that the use of a market-consistent current value measurement model for the fulfilment cash flows is desirable because it provides the most relevant information about
fulfilment cash flows, by incorporating all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort on a timely basis; and, hence
changes in the fulfilment cash flows, including changes in the economic value of options and guarantees embedded in insurance contracts.
This means that there is no need for a separate liability adequacy test.
On initial recognition, the contractual service margin is an amount that reflects the excess of the consideration charged for a group of insurance contracts over the risk-adjusted expected present value of the cash outflows expected to fulfil the group of contracts and any insurance acquisition cash flows incurred before the recognition of the group of contracts.
Accordingly, if a group of contracts is onerous on initial recognition, no contractual service margin would be recognised.
This reflects the Board's view that the carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts should reflect the obligation of the entity to provide future service, and that amount should be at least equal to the fulfilment cash flows.
These changes depict changes in the future profit to be earned from providing services under the contracts, and include
changes in the estimates of the fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service (see paragraphs BC222–BC269C);
the effect of the time value of money on the contractual service margin (see paragraphs BC270–BC276E) and, for insurance contracts with direct participation features, changes in the entity's share of the underlying items (see paragraphs BC238–BC263);
the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the contractual service margin (see paragraphs BC277–BC278); and
the profit earned in the period from providing services (see paragraphs BC279–BC283J).
Although the service and financial components of an insurance contract are not separated for measurement on initial recognition, the Board decided that changes in the carrying amount of the insurance contract have different information value, depending on the nature of the change.
As a result of the combined treatment of the changes in the fulfilment cash flows and the changes in the contractual service margin
changes in estimates relating to current period and past period service are recognised in profit or loss (see paragraphs BC224(c) and BC232–BC236); and
changes in estimates arising from assumptions that relate to financial risks, including the effects of changes in discount rates, are recognised in profit or loss, or profit or loss and other comprehensive income, in the period in which the change occurs (except for some such changes for insurance contracts with direct participation features (see paragraphs BC238–BC247)).
The total carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts (ie the fulfilment cash flows plus the contractual service margin) can be regarded as having the following components
a liability for incurred claims, being the fulfilment cash flows for claims and expenses already incurred but not yet paid.
the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage and the resulting profit and revenue recognition being broadly consistent with IFRS 15, except that
for insurance contracts without direct participation features — the measurement is updated for changes in financial assumptions; and
for insurance contracts with direct participation features — the measurement is updated for changes in the fair value of the items in which the entity and the policyholder participate; and
The determination of revenue under previous insurance accounting practices varied across jurisdictions and often resulted in the presentation of revenue amounts that could not be easily compared with the information reported by other entities, either in the insurance industry or in other industries.
the accounting of deposits as revenue; and
the recognition of revenue on a cash basis.
Consistent with that Standard, an entity depicts revenue for the transfer of promised coverage and other services at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the services.
recognises insurance revenue in each period as it satisfies the performance obligations in the insurance contracts.
The Board decided that determining insurance revenue in this way makes the financial statements of entities that issue insurance contracts more understandable and more comparable with other entities.
It also increases comparability among entities that issue insurance contracts.
Both this approach and the simpler premium allocation approach (see paragraphs BC288–BC295) allocate customer consideration in a way that reflects the transfer of services provided under the contract.
Many users of financial statements use measures of revenue to provide information about the volume of business and gross performance.
The Board considered the view that lack of comparability between the presentation of insurance results and revenue amounts reported by entities in other sectors would not be a significant disadvantage to users of financial statements of entities that issue insurance contracts.
In the view of some, users of financial statements do not typically compare the results of entities that issue insurance contracts with those of other entities.
Instead, they argue that many users of financial statements that specialise in the insurance sector rely on the disaggregated information in the notes to the financial statements.
In contrast, the profit from other transactions is measured as the difference between revenue and expenses.
Such measures give information about the total increase in assets under management.
Applying IFRS 17, this would instead be reported in the notes to the financial statements and elsewhere.
The Board rejected this view.
To do so would be equivalent to a bank recognising a deposit as revenue and its repayment as an expense.
To achieve this without separating the investment component for measurement purposes, the Board decided to identify the investment components only at the time revenue and incurred claims are recognised, and to exclude the amounts so identified.
In doing this, the Board considered defining the investment component as (a) the amount that the contract requires to be repaid when no insured event occurs, rather than (b) the amount that would be repaid even if an insured event does not occur.
For example, if the entity pays the higher of an account balance and a fixed amount in the event of a policyholder's death, using the definition in (a) the whole of the payment that results from the policyholder's death would be regarded as relating to the insurance component rather than to the investment component.
Using the definition in (a) has the practical advantage that an entity would need to identify cash flows relating to an investment component only if it made a payment in the absence of an insured event.
However, the Board decided that defining an investment component in this way does not faithfully represent the fact that the amount accumulated in the account balance through deposits by the policyholder is paid to the policyholder in all circumstances, including in the event of the policyholder's death.
In the Board's view, the insurance benefit is the additional amount that the entity would be required to pay if an insured event occurs.
However, the liability for remaining coverage represents the obligation to provide coverage for a future period and other services needed to fulfil the contract.
As a result, recognising insurance revenue to the extent of a reduction in the liability for remaining coverage, adjusted to eliminate changes that do not relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation, would faithfully represent the entity's performance in providing services.
These adjustments ensure that the total insurance revenue presented over the duration of the group of insurance contracts is the same as the premiums received for services, adjusted for a financing component.
The Board considered whether each period's coverage should be treated as a separate performance obligation or whether the coverage for the entire contract should be regarded as a single performance obligation that would be satisfied over time.
When considering the principle from IFRS 15, the Board concluded that the obligation to provide coverage in any particular part of the entire coverage period would generally not be a separate performance obligation, and the coverage and services provided over the whole duration of the contract would generally be treated as a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time.
Hence, a change in the pattern of expected cash flows results in the entity updating its measure of progress and adjusting the amount of revenue recognised accordingly.
A consequence of the decision to measure the satisfaction of the entity's performance obligations in each period using the change in the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage during each period is that insurance revenue will be recognised partly on the basis of the expected claims and benefits.
Some expressed concern about this and hence questioned whether the service provided by an insurance contract was adequately represented by the change in the measurement of an entity's obligation.
Rather, they thought that revenue (the gross amount) ought to be determined independently of changes in the obligation (the net amount).
However, the Board concluded that time-based methods of allocating premiums would not reflect the fact that the value of the services provided in each period may differ.
Instead, the Board noted that the amount reported as the liability for remaining coverage represents the value of the obligation to provide services.
The Board therefore concluded that the reduction in the liability for remaining coverage is a reasonable representation of the value of the performance obligation to provide services that was satisfied in the period.
The reduction in the liability for remaining coverage includes an allocation of the contractual service margin to reflect the services provided in the period.
That allocation reflects the quantity of benefits provided and duration of contracts in a group.
The other changes in the liability for remaining coverage that represent revenue for the period are measured using current assumptions.
Insurance finance income or expenses comprise the changes in the carrying amount of the asset or liability for a group of insurance contracts arising from
the effect of financial risks and changes in financial risks; but
excluding any such effects for groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features that would normally adjust the contractual service margin but do not do so because the group of insurance contracts is onerous.
These effects are recognised as part of the insurance service result, for the reasons given in paragraph BC247.
assumptions about inflation based on an index of prices or rates or on prices of assets with inflation-linked returns are financial assumptions; and
assumptions about inflation based on an entity's expectation of specific price changes are non-financial assumptions.
Doing so provides useful information about different aspects of the entity's performance.
Such income or expenses for a portfolio of insurance contracts is either all included in profit or loss or is disaggregated between profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
If disaggregated, the amount in profit or loss is based on a systematic allocation of the expected total finance income or expenses over the duration of the groups of insurance contracts in the portfolio.
The systematic allocation is based on the characteristics of the insurance contracts, without reference to factors that do not affect the cash flows expected to arise under the contracts.
For example, the allocation of the insurance finance income or expenses should be based on expected recognised returns on assets only if those expected recognised returns affect the cash flows of the contracts.
The Board decided to allow entities to choose an accounting policy for the presentation of insurance finance income or expenses to balance the sometimes competing demands of understandability and comparability.
By allowing an accounting policy choice, the Board
acknowledges that it could be appropriate for an entity to disaggregate the effect of changes in assumptions that relate to financial risks between profit or loss and other comprehensive income by presenting the insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss using a systematic allocation based on the characteristics of the insurance contract;
allows entities to avoid the costs and complexity of using other comprehensive income when the benefits of doing so do not outweigh those costs (because permitting entities to present the total insurance finance income or expenses in a period in profit or loss allows entities to avoid additional calculations to derive separate amounts to be presented in profit or loss and other comprehensive income).
The Board noted that, in selecting an accounting policy, entities would need to apply judgement regarding the policy's relative benefits and costs.
The Board decided to require entities to make the accounting policy choice for each portfolio because a key factor in making the choice will be what assets the entity regards as backing the insurance contracts.
The Board received feedback that many entities regard the choice of strategies for assets backing insurance contracts to be driven by the differences between portfolios of insurance contracts.
Accordingly, an option applied to portfolios of insurance contracts would allow entities to reduce accounting mismatches.
The Board concluded that even if it were to allow an accounting policy choice, entities within the same jurisdiction are likely to remain comparable because they are likely to issue similar products and adopt similar asset strategies for those products.
Thus, the entities are likely to make similar accounting policy choices.
Alternative approaches to the presentation of insurance finance income or expenses considered but rejected by the Board are discussed in paragraphs BC340–BC342C.
Basis of disaggregation (paragraphs B129–B136 of IFRS 17)
Allowing an accounting policy choice on whether to present in profit or loss insurance finance income or expenses using a systematic allocation raises the question of what constitutes a systematic allocation.
The Board considered a cost-based presentation approach and discussed various practical methods of determining a cost measurement basis for the insurance finance income or expenses.
However, the Board concluded that some potentially appropriate approaches, such as some projected crediting methods, could not be described as cost measurements.
Instead, the Board decided to set an objective for disaggregating the insurance finance income or expenses of a systematic allocation based on the characteristics of the insurance contracts.
The Board considered whether this disaggregation objective alone would be sufficient, given the variety of contracts and the need to tailor more specific requirements to the features of different contracts.
However, the Board concluded that a lack of prescribed methods might result in a lack of comparable information.
An inherent feature of any systematic allocation of insurance finance income or expenses based on the characteristics of a group of insurance contracts is potential accounting mismatches between the insurance contracts and the finance income or expenses on assets held by the entity.
The only way of completely eliminating such accounting mismatches for all insurance contracts would be to measure both the insurance contracts and the assets using the same measure of current value and to include all finance income or expenses in profit or loss.
However, for insurance contracts for which there can be no economic mismatch with the assets held, it is possible to eliminate accounting mismatches between the insurance contracts and the assets in a different way, by using the current period book yield.
The current period book yield is the change in the carrying amount of assets regarded as backing the insurance contracts, recognised in profit or loss for the period.
The Board considered whether the same requirement should apply to groups of insurance contracts to which the current period book yield applies.
The Board concluded that to achieve the objective of the current period book yield, which is to eliminate accounting mismatches between the insurance contracts and the assets held, no amounts should be reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on a transfer of a group beyond any such amounts arising because of the change in carrying amount of the assets recognised in profit or loss in the period of the transfer.
In developing the approach outlined in paragraph BC16, the Board considered the following pervasive issues
the complexity of the Standard.
An entity's rights and obligations arise from individual contracts with policyholders.
However, a fundamental aspect of much insurance activity is that the entity issues a large number of similar contracts knowing that some will result in claims and others will not.
The large number of contracts reduces the risk that the outcome across all the contracts will differ from that expected by the entity.
In reaching a decision on the level of aggregation, the Board balanced the loss of information inevitably caused by the aggregation of contracts with the usefulness of the resulting information in depicting the financial performance of an entity's insurance activities and with the operational burden of collecting the information (see paragraphs BC115–BC139T).
The Board was aware that the development of an accounting model for insurance contracts would inevitably result in possible accounting mismatches because of the different basis of accounting for assets and liabilities in other Standards.
Nonetheless the Board has minimised the extent of accounting mismatch, when possible, while recognising this limitation.
Particular consideration was given to potential or perceived accounting mismatches arising from
the presentation of insurance finance income or expenses (see paragraphs BC38–BC49);
the measurement of underlying items for insurance contracts with direct participation features (see paragraph BC56); and
some requested that the Board create a hedge accounting solution for insurance contracts without direct participation features;
some noted that the Board is researching a model for dynamic risk management, and suggested aligning the projects; and
some noted that the application of the risk mitigation requirements on a prospective basis would not eliminate accounting mismatches for relationships that started before the date of initial application.
The Board's decisions on risk mitigation techniques related to insurance contracts with direct participation features reduce the accounting mismatches that were introduced by the variable fee approach by providing an option to align the overall effect of the variable fee approach more closely to the model for other insurance contracts (see paragraphs BC250–BC256H).
However, the Board concluded that it would not be appropriate to develop a bespoke solution for all hedging activities for insurance contracts, noting that such a solution should form part of a broader project.
The Board also concluded that a prospective basis was necessary for the application of the risk mitigation requirements on transition, for the reasons set out in paragraph BC393.
Insurance contracts with direct participation features are measured by reference to the fair value of the underlying items (see paragraphs BC238–BC249D).
This measurement reflects the investment-related nature of the contracts.
Applying IFRS Standards, many underlying items will also be measured at fair value.
The Board also decided to amend some IFRS Standards to enable additional underlying items to be measured at fair value (see paragraph BC65(c)).
The Board noted that all such mismatches would be eliminated only if all assets and liabilities were recognised and measured at fair value.
recognising it as profit over the coverage period of the contracts (see paragraph BC59);
adjusting it for changes in estimates of cash flows relating to future service, with different requirements for different types of insurance contracts (see paragraph BC60); and
(iii) the consequent need for a specified level of aggregation (see paragraphs BC51–BC52).
The recognition of the contractual service margin as profit over the coverage period, rather than as a gain immediately on initial recognition of the group of insurance contracts, adds complexity for preparers because they will need to track and allocate the contractual service margin.
However, the Board concluded that recognition of the profit in the group of insurance contracts over the coverage period is necessary to represent faithfully an entity's financial performance over the coverage period.
The requirement to adjust the contractual service margin for changes in estimates relating to future service increases complexity for both users and preparers of financial statements.
For preparers of financial statements, complexity arises from the need to identify the changes in estimates of future cash flows that adjust the contractual service margin separately from changes in estimates that do not adjust the contractual service margin.
For both, a particular source of complexity arises from the distinction between changes in estimates relating to future service and changes relating to past service.
That distinction may be subjective and may vary according to when the entity makes the change in estimate.
An entity adjusts the contractual service margin for a change in estimates of cash flows that is made before the cash flows occur.
In contrast, the entity recognises an experience adjustment in profit or loss and does not adjust the contractual service margin if there is no change in estimate before the cash flows occur.
The requirement to present insurance revenue in the financial statements increases complexity for preparers because entities must identify investment components and exclude them from insurance revenue and from incurred claims presented in the statement of profit or loss.
Some preparers expressed concern about the operational challenges of compliance.
However, the Board decided that these potential challenges are outweighed by the following benefits of the requirements
For example, many users have indicated that if entities reported investment components as revenue, they would overstate revenue and could distort performance measures such as combined ratios.
Such reporting would also hamper comparability between insurers and entities in other industries.
Such a measurement would reduce the complexity of financial statements overall.
Requiring an entity to make an accounting policy choice on how to present insurance finance income or expenses introduces complexity for both preparers of financial statements, who have to assess what choice to make, and for users of financial statements who have to understand what choice has been made and its implications on the amounts presented.
The Board had proposed requiring insurance finance income or expenses to be disaggregated between profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
However, the Board was persuaded that the balance between the costs and benefits of such disaggregation will vary significantly across entities depending on the type of insurance contracts that they issue and the information that the users of their financial statements find most useful.
The Board therefore concluded that it should leave the assessment of that balance to be made by the entity.
The Board decided to base its approach on the type of activity rather than on the type of the entity because
The Board also noted that investment contracts with discretionary participation features are almost exclusively issued by entities that issue insurance contracts (see paragraphs BC82–BC86).
The Board decided that for many contracts that specify a link to returns on underlying items, those underlying items include a mix of assets that are almost all measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Measurement of own shares, own debt and owner-occupied property at fair value through profit or loss would be consistent with the measurement of the majority of the underlying assets and would prevent accounting mismatches.
Other IFRS Standards include requirements that may apply to some aspects of such contracts.
Accordingly, the Board did not view work on policyholder accounting as a high priority.
The following aspects of the definition of an insurance contract are discussed below
the definition of a contract (see paragraphs BC69–BC70);
the insurance risk (see paragraphs BC71–BC72);
the insurable interest (see paragraphs BC73–BC75);
the quantity of insurance risk (see paragraphs BC76–BC80); and
the expiry of insurance-contingent rights and obligations (see paragraph BC81).
Thus, when referring to contractual terms the effects of law and regulation are also considered.
They apply when an entity considers how to classify a contract and when assessing the substantive rights and obligations for determining the boundary of a contract.
The Board's reasons for requiring such cash flows to be included in the measurement are set out in paragraphs BC167–BC169.
Some contracts have the legal form of insurance contracts but do not transfer significant insurance risk to the issuer.
Insurable interest (paragraphs B7–B16 of IFRS 17)
The definition of an insurance contract reflects the risk the entity accepts from the policyholders by agreeing to compensate the policyholders if they are adversely affected by an uncertain event (paragraph B12 of IFRS 17).
The notion that the uncertain event must have an adverse effect on the policyholder is known as 'insurable interest'.
The Board considered whether it should eliminate the notion of insurable interest and replace it with the notion that insurance involves assembling risks into a pool in which they can be managed together.
Some argued that doing so would appropriately include the following within the scope of the Standard
contracts that require payment if a specified uncertain future event occurs, causing economic exposure similar to insurance contracts, whether the other party has an insurable interest or not; and
However, the Board decided to retain the notion of insurable interest because without the reference to 'adverse effect', the definition might have captured any prepaid contract to provide services with uncertain costs.
Such a definition would have extended the meaning of the term 'insurance contract' beyond its traditional meaning, which the Board did not want to do.
The notion of insurable interest is also needed to avoid including gambling in the definition of insurance.
Furthermore, it is a principle-based distinction, particularly between insurance contracts and contracts used for hedging.
Quantity of insurance risk (paragraphs B17–B25 of IFRS 17)
In developing this material, the Board considered the criteria in US GAAP for a contract to be treated as an insurance contract, which includes the notion that there should be a 'reasonable possibility' of a 'significant loss'.
However, quantitative guidance risks creating an arbitrary dividing line that results in different accounting treatments for similar transactions that fall marginally on different sides of the line.
Instead, noting the criteria applied in US GAAP, the Board decided to add the requirement that a contract transfers insurance risk only if there is a scenario with commercial substance in which the issuer has a possibility of a loss on a present value basis.
However, a single contract, or even a single book of similar contracts, would rarely generate a material loss in relation to the financial statements as a whole.
Although entities manage contracts by portfolios, the contractual rights and obligations arise from individual contracts.
The Board also rejected the notion of defining the significance of insurance risk by expressing the expected (ie probability-weighted) average of the present values of the adverse outcomes as a proportion of the expected present value of all outcomes, or as a proportion of the premium.
This notion had some intuitive appeal because it would include both amount and probability.
However, such a definition would have meant that a contract could start as a financial liability and become an insurance contract as time passes or probabilities are reassessed.
In the Board's view, it would be too burdensome to require an entity to continuously monitor whether a contract meets the definition of an insurance contract over its duration.
Instead, the Board adopted an approach that requires the decision about whether a contract is an insurance contract to be made once only, at contract inception (unless the terms of the contract are modified).
Expiry of insurance-contingent rights and obligations
Some stakeholders suggested that a contract should not be accounted for as an insurance contract if the insurance-contingent rights and obligations expire after a very short time.
Although investment contracts with discretionary participation features do not meet the definition of insurance contracts, the advantages of treating them the same as insurance contracts rather than as financial instruments when they are issued by entities that issue insurance contracts are that
Sometimes investment contracts with discretionary participation features share in the performance of insurance contracts.
Using the same accounting for both types of contracts will produce more useful information for users of financial statements because it enhances comparability within an entity.
It also simplifies the accounting for those contracts.
For example, some cash flow distributions to participating policyholders are made in aggregate both for insurance contracts that specify a link to returns on underlying items and for investment contracts with discretionary participation features.
This makes it challenging to apply different accounting models to different parts of that aggregate participation.
Splitting these contracts into components with different accounting treatments would cause the same problems that would arise if insurance contracts were separated (see paragraph BC10(a)).
Also, in the Board's view, the accounting model it has developed for insurance contracts, including the treatment of discretionary cash flows (see paragraphs BC167–BC170), is more appropriate than using any other model for these types of contracts.
the date of initial recognition is the date the entity becomes party to the contract, because there is no pre-coverage period and hence the practical concerns noted in paragraph BC141 do not arise;
the contract boundary principle builds on the defining characteristic, namely the presence of the discretionary participation features, rather than on the existence of insurance risk; and
the requirement for the recognition of the contractual service margin in profit or loss refers to the pattern of the provision of investment related services.
warranties provided by a manufacturer, dealer or retailer in connection with the sale of its goods or services to a customer (see paragraphs BC89–BC90).
some financial guarantee contracts (see paragraphs BC91–BC94).
insurance contracts in which the entity is the policyholder, unless those contracts are reinsurance contracts (see paragraph BC66).
Product warranties (paragraphs 7(a) and B26(g) of IFRS 17)
Such warranties might provide a customer with assurance that the related product will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications, or they might provide the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications.
Further, in the Board's view, accounting for such contracts in the same way as other contracts with customers would provide comparable information for the users of financial statements for the entities that issue such contracts.
Hence, the Board concluded that changing the existing accounting for these contracts would impose costs and disruption for no significant benefit.
Financial guarantee contracts (paragraph 7(e) of IFRS 17)
IFRS Standards define a financial guarantee contract as a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
These contracts transfer credit risk and may have various legal forms, such as a guarantee, some types of letters of credit, a credit default contract or an insurance contract.
Some view all contracts that transfer credit risk as financial instruments.
However, a precondition for a payment in the contracts described in paragraph BC91 is that the holder has suffered a loss — a distinguishing feature of insurance contracts.
Consequently, an entity should account for financial guarantee contracts in the same way as other insurance contracts.
Similar accounting should apply to similar contracts.
As a result, an entity should account for financial guarantee contracts in the same way as other financial instruments.
However, although the terms of the option may appear to be imprecise, in the vast majority of cases the accounting choice for financial guarantee contracts is clear and no implementation problems appear to have been identified in practice.
The Board did not view it as a high priority to address the inconsistency that results from accounting for financial guarantee contracts differently depending on the issuer.
Some credit-related contracts lack the precondition for payment that the holder has suffered a loss.
An example of such a contract is one that requires payments in response to changes in a specified credit rating or credit index.
The Board concluded that those contracts are derivatives and do not meet the definition of an insurance contract.
Therefore, such contracts will continue to be accounted for as derivatives.
Credit card contracts and similar contracts that provide credit or payment arrangements (paragraph 7(h) of IFRS 17)
BC94A Some contracts that provide credit or payment arrangements meet the definition of an insurance contract—for example, some credit card contracts, charge card contracts, consumer financing contracts or bank account contracts.
The Board concluded that such restrictions would mitigate the lack of comparability that might otherwise arise between similar contracts issued by the same entity.
A fixed-fee service contract is a contract in which the level of service depends on an uncertain event.
Examples include roadside assistance programmes and maintenance contracts in which the service provider agrees to repair specified equipment after a malfunction.
Such contracts meet the definition of an insurance contract because
it is uncertain whether, or when, assistance or a repair will be needed;
the owner is adversely affected by the occurrence; and
the service provider compensates the owner if assistance or repair is needed.
Fixed-fee service contracts meet the definition of an insurance contract.
Further, the Board decided the practice of accounting for these contracts in the same way as other contracts with customers would provide useful information for the users of financial statements for the entities that issue such contracts.
Hence, the Board thought that changing the accounting for these contracts would impose costs and disruption for no significant benefit.
However, some stakeholders noted some entities issue both fixed-fee service contracts and other insurance contracts.
For example, some entities issue both roadside assistance contracts and insurance contracts for damage arising from accidents.
Insurance contracts create rights and obligations that work together to generate cash inflows and cash outflows.
Separating such non-insurance components from an insurance contract can improve comparability.
Accounting for such components using other applicable IFRS Standards makes them more comparable to similar contracts that are issued as separate contracts, and allows users of financial statements to better compare the risks undertaken by entities in different businesses or industries.
Separating a single contract into components could result in complex accounting that does not provide useful information for interdependent cash flows attributable to the components.
Furthermore, when cash flows are interdependent, separating the cash flows for each component can be arbitrary, particularly if the contract includes cross-subsidies between components or discounts.
Also, as noted in paragraph BC10(a), when separation ignores interdependencies between components, the sum of the values of the components may not always equal the value of the contract as a whole, even on initial recognition.
However, stakeholders indicated that some were unsure how to interpret the term closely related for non-insurance components embedded in insurance contracts.
embedded derivatives (see paragraphs BC104–BC107);
goods and non-insurance services (see paragraphs BC110–BC113).
BC103 The criteria for separating such non-insurance components from insurance components differ to reflect the different characteristics of the non-insurance components.
This is consistent with applying different accounting models to the equivalent contracts accounted for on a stand-alone basis.
Embedded derivatives (paragraph 11(a) of IFRS 17)
The Board noted that accounting separately for some embedded derivatives in hybrid contracts
ensures that contractual rights and obligations that create similar risk exposures are treated alike whether or not they are embedded in a non-derivative host contract.
counters the possibility that entities might seek to avoid the requirement to measure derivatives at fair value through profit or loss by embedding a derivative in a non-derivative host contract.
In the Board's view, fair value through profit or loss is the only measurement basis that provides relevant information about derivatives.
If derivatives were measured at cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, their role in reducing or increasing risk would not be visible.
In addition, the value of derivatives often changes disproportionately in response to market movements and fair value is the measurement basis that best captures such non-linear responses to changes in risk.
That information is essential to communicate the nature of the rights and obligations inherent in derivatives to users of financial statements.
The Board's approach is consistent with the approach it has taken with hybrid contracts other than hybrid financial assets.
The Board concluded that when embedded derivatives are closely related to the host insurance contract, the benefits of separating those embedded derivatives fail to outweigh the costs.
However, the Board decided that those benefits would exceed the costs when the embedded derivatives are not closely related to the host insurance contract.
Previous practice indicates that the costs of separating such embedded derivatives from host insurance contracts would not be excessive.
As explained in paragraph BC10(a), the Board decided that it would be difficult to routinely separate such investment components from insurance contracts.
separate only any distinct investment components from insurance contracts.
An investment component is distinct if the cash flows of the insurance contract are not highly interrelated with the cash flows from the investment component.
Separating such components does not create the problems noted in paragraph BC10(a).
This requirement is consistent with the objective of separation, which is to account for a separated component the way stand-alone contracts with similar characteristics are accounted for.
In the Board's view, in most cases, entities would be able to determine an observable stand-alone selling price for the goods or services bundled in an insurance contract if those components meet the separation criteria.
Applying IFRS 15, any discounts and cross-subsidies are allocated to components proportionately or on the basis of observable evidence.
In the Board's view, this approach ensures that the allocation of cross-subsidies and discounts / supplements reflects the economics of the separated components.
Insurance acquisition cash flows and some fulfilment cash flows relating to overhead costs do not clearly relate to one of the components.
Such components may have been separated when applying previous accounting practices.
However, the Board concluded that it would not be possible to separate in a non-arbitrary way a component that is not distinct from the insurance contract nor would such a result be desirable.
Permitting an entity to separate such components would mean that the entity measures the components in the contract on an arbitrary basis.
The Board also noted that when separation ignores interdependencies between insurance and non-insurance components, the sum of the values of the components may not always equal the value of the contract as a whole, even on initial recognition.
That would reduce the comparability of the financial statements across entities.
Some aspects of the adjustments to the carrying amount of the contractual service margin result in gains being treated differently from losses or changes in estimates relating to current and past service being treated differently from changes in estimates relating to future service (see paragraphs BC21–BC24).
These different treatments mean that the accounting result depends on the level of aggregation at which the adjustments are made, because amounts that would offset each other within the measurement of a group of insurance contracts would be treated differently (and hence not offset each other) if contracts were measured individually.
BC116 For example, suppose an entity issued a group of identical contracts expecting that there would be more claims from some of the contracts than others, but not knowing which contracts would be the ones with more claims.
Subsequently it becomes apparent which contracts are likely to give rise to claims and which are not, and the number of contracts in each category is as expected.
If the contracts were measured individually, the expected claims may cause the contracts for which they are likely to arise to become onerous, with an equal and opposite reduction in the fulfilment cash flows of the other contracts.
The entity would recognise a loss for the onerous contracts immediately in profit or loss and an increase in the contractual service margin for the other contracts.
That increase in the contractual service margin would not be recognised immediately in profit or loss but instead would be recognised over the current and future coverage period.
The fulfilment cash flows include all changes in estimates, regardless of whether they are gains or losses or they relate to past, current or future service.
Measuring contracts individually would also provide a clear measurement objective.
However, the Board decided that such an approach would not provide useful information about insurance activities, which often rely on an entity issuing a number of similar contracts to reduce risk.
The Board concluded, therefore, that the contractual service margin should be measured at a group level.
BC119 Once the Board had decided that the contractual service margin should be measured for a group, the Board considered what that group level should be.
The Board considered whether it could draw on requirements for groups set by insurance regulators.
However, as noted in paragraph BC15, regulatory requirements focus on solvency not on reporting financial performance.
In particular, the Board noted that the less profitable group of contracts would have a lesser ability to withstand unfavourable changes in estimates and might become onerous before the more profitable group would do so.
The Board regards information about onerous contracts as useful information about an entity's decisions on pricing contracts and about future cash flows, and wanted this information to be reported on a timely basis.
Paragraph BC279 explains that, following the Board's principle for the allocation of the contractual service margin, an entity should systematically recognise the remaining contractual service margin in profit or loss over the current and remaining coverage period to reflect the remaining transfer of services to be provided by the insurance contracts.
When this is the case, measuring the contracts on
an individual basis would mean that the contractual service margin associated with contracts with a shorter than average coverage period would be fully recognised in profit or loss over that shorter period;
a group basis would mean that the contractual service margin associated with contracts with a shorter than average coverage period would not be fully recognised in profit or loss over that shorter period.
In principle, this condition would ensure the contractual service margin of a particularly profitable individual contract within a group is not carried forward after the individual contract has expired.
In principle, this condition would ensure the contractual service margin of an individual contract that expired was not carried forward after the contract had expired.
did not want the contractual service margin of an expired contract to exist as part of the average contractual service margin of a group long after the coverage provided by the contract ended, but also did not want to recognise a disproportionate amount of contractual service margin for contracts lapsing as expected within a group of similar contracts.
requiring contracts in a group to have similar expected profitability — meaning that loss-making contracts could not be grouped with profitable contracts, whether at initial recognition or if changes in conditions make a previously profitable group loss-making.
Hence, such a requirement would provide information about loss-making groups of insurance contracts.
requiring groups not be reassessed after initial recognition.
BC125 The Board also noted that, in principle, it would be possible to meet the objective of the recognition of the contractual service margin in profit or loss discussed in paragraph BC120 either by grouping only contracts with a similar size of contractual service margin and the same remaining coverage period, or by reflecting the different duration and profitability of the contracts within the group in the allocation of the contractual service margin.
BC126 The Board noted that entities could interpret the approach described in paragraphs BC124–BC125 as requiring an excessively large number of groups that may provide insufficiently useful information to justify the operational burden that would be imposed by extensive disaggregation of portfolios.
Accordingly, the Board sought a balance to reflect profit and potential losses in the statement of financial performance in appropriate periods and the operational burden.
BC127 To achieve that balance, the Board concluded that an entity should be required to identify portfolios of contracts subject to similar risks and managed together, and to divide a portfolio into, at a minimum, groups of
contracts that are onerous at initial recognition, if any;
contracts that are not onerous at initial recognition and that have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently, if any; and
all other contracts, if any.
BC129 The objective of the requirement to identify contracts that are onerous at initial recognition is to identify contracts that are onerous measured as individual contracts.
An entity typically issues individual contracts and it is the characteristics of the individual contracts that determine how they should be grouped.
However, the Board concluded this does not mean that the contracts must be measured individually.
If an entity can determine using reasonable and supportable information that a set of contracts will all be in the same group, then the entity can measure that set to determine whether the contracts are onerous or not, because there will be no offsetting effects in the measurement of the set.
The same principle applies to the identification of contracts that are not onerous at initial recognition and that have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently — the objective is to identify such contracts at an individual contract level, but this objective can be achieved by assessing a set of contracts if the entity can conclude using reasonable and supportable information that the contracts in the set will all be in the same group.
The Board decided that to assess whether contracts that are not onerous at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently, an entity should use the information provided by its internal reporting system but need not gather additional information.
The Board concluded that such information would provide a sufficient basis for making this assessment and that it would not be necessary to impose costs of gathering additional information.
Some stakeholders nonetheless expressed the view that separating contracts that have no significant possibility of becoming onerous from other contracts that are not onerous was burdensome and unnecessary.
In general, the Board seeks to minimise exemptions because they increase complexity for both users of financial statements and preparers and may have unintended consequences for future standard-setting activities.
Further, providing an exemption for accounting for economic differences caused by the effect of law or regulation on pricing may create an undesirable precedent, given that such effects are not restricted to insurance contracts.
In deciding the appropriate grouping of contracts, the Board sought to balance the need to group contracts to reflect the economics of issuing insurance contracts against grouping at too high a level, which would reduce the usefulness of information produced (see paragraph BC123).
BC132 The Board concluded it would not provide useful information to group separately contracts that an entity is required by specific law or regulation to group together for determining the pricing or level of benefits.
All market participants in that jurisdiction will be constrained in the same way, particularly if such entities are unable to refuse to provide insurance coverage solely on the basis of differences in that characteristic.
These practices are sometimes termed 'self-regulatory practices'.
Grouping contracts that have different likelihoods of becoming onerous reduces the information provided to users of financial statements.
These stakeholders do not think that contracts that have been priced on the same basis by the entity should be in different groups.
The Board noted that applying IFRS 17, an entity would not be expected under normal circumstances to group separately contracts priced on the same basis by the entity.
In that case, the information that is used to determine the groups will be the same information that is available to the entity for pricing purposes.
If contracts are onerous at inception, that will generally be the result of an intentional pricing strategy (and is likely to be relatively infrequent).
If contracts are not onerous at inception, the date of initial recognition may be later than inception (see paragraphs BC140–BC144).
Hence, the information used for determining the groups may differ from the information that had been available for pricing purposes.
BC136 The Board noted that the decisions outlined in paragraph BC127 could lead to perpetual open portfolios.
The Board was concerned that this could lead to a loss of information about the development of profitability over time, could result in the contractual service margin persisting beyond the duration of contacts in the group, and consequently could result in profits not being recognised in the correct periods.
The Board observed that such grouping was important to ensure that trends in the profitability of a portfolio of contracts were reflected in the financial statements on a timely basis.
However, the Board considered that any principle-based approach that satisfied the Board's objective would require the reintroduction of a test for similar profitability, which as set out in paragraph BC126, was rejected as being operationally burdensome.
Some stakeholders asserted that such a division would distort the reported result of those contracts and would be operationally burdensome.
Therefore it may not be necessary for an entity to restrict groups in this way to achieve the same accounting outcome in some circumstances.
However, as noted above, an entity will typically enter into transactions for individual contracts.
The Board therefore considered whether to amend the requirements, and if so, how (see paragraph BC139B).
Having considered a number of possible amendments, the Board reaffirmed its view that the benefits of the level of aggregation requirements significantly outweigh the costs.
The Board therefore decided to retain the requirements unchanged.
Aspects of internal management such as asset and liability management strategy or risk management strategy have different objectives.
Hence an approach based on those aspects would not necessarily achieve the Board's objective.
This suggestion would have removed the requirement to group separately insurance contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous from other insurance contracts that are not onerous at initial recognition.
The Board noted that an entity will generally issue contracts expecting them to be profitable, and losses will arise subsequently as a result of changes in expectations.
Including all contracts that are profitable at initial recognition in a single group could significantly delay loss recognition or increase the risk of losses for onerous contracts never being recognised.
Other suggestions related to specific types of insurance contracts—those with intergenerational sharing of risks between policyholders (see paragraphs BC139I–BC139S).
The contractual service margin of each group would average the profitability of all contracts in the group over the life of the portfolio, resulting in the loss of useful information about trends in profitability.
The effect of averaging profits of the contracts in the group could therefore be substantially increased, leading to a greater likelihood that
the contractual service margin of a contract would outlast the coverage period of that contract; and
the continuing profitability of some contracts would absorb the subsequent adverse changes in expectations that make some contracts onerous.
The Board reaffirmed its view that the requirements specify the amounts to be reported, not the methodology to be used to arrive at those amounts (see paragraph BC138).
However, the Board concluded that information about higher or lower profits earned by an entity from different generations of contracts is sufficiently useful to justify such costs.
applying the requirement to such contracts requires arbitrary allocations, and the resulting information is therefore not useful; and
implementing the requirement is particularly costly and complex for such contracts, and the cost exceeds the resulting benefit.
However, each generation of contracts may be more or less profitable for an entity than other generations.
The entity's share in the fair value returns on underlying items is unaffected by the way the policyholders' share is distributed among generations of policyholders.
For example, even if all generations of policyholders share equally in the fair value returns on the same pool of underlying items, the amount of the entity's share in those fair value returns created by each generation may differ.
distinguishing between the effect of risk sharing and the effect of discretion (paragraph BC139L); and
BC139L The aspect set out in paragraph BC139K(a) relates to circumstances in which an entity has discretion over the portion of the fair value returns on underlying items that the entity pays to policyholders and the portion that the entity retains.
The Board acknowledged that an entity with such discretion is required to apply additional judgement compared to an entity without such discretion to allocate changes in fulfilment cash flows between groups in a way that appropriately reflects the effect of risk sharing and the effect of the discretion.
BC139M The aspect set out in paragraph BC139K(b) relates to insurance contracts with direct participation features.
For such contracts, an entity adjusts the contractual service margin for changes in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of underlying items.
include features such as financial guarantees on the returns on underlying items or other cash flows that do not vary with returns on underlying items (for example, insurance claims); and
do not share the changes in the effect of the features in (a) between the entity and policyholders, or share the changes in the effect between the entity and policyholders in a way that results in the entity bearing more than a small share.
The Board instead observed the rarity makes the information particularly useful to users of financial statements when such an event occurs.
The Board identified such information about the effect of financial guarantees as being particularly important when interest rates are low.
The population is much smaller than some stakeholders had suggested.
An exemption would therefore result in difficulties for entities and auditors in identifying which contracts would be exempted, and for users of financial statements in understanding which contracts had been exempted.
However, there is no way to specify the scope of the exemption other than by using arbitrary thresholds because the balance of costs and benefits for different contracts vary across a range and there is no clearly identifiable point at which the costs exceed the benefits.
For a very limited population of contracts the costs and benefits of the requirement are more finely balanced.
However, it is not possible to define that population in a way that does not risk it becoming too broad.
The profitability of a contract is initially set when the contract is issued, based on facts and circumstances at that date—for example, interest rates, underwriting expectations and pricing.
BC140 The Board considered whether an entity should recognise the obligations and associated benefits arising from a group of insurance contracts from the time at which it accepts risk.
BC141 Further, some stakeholders were concerned that a requirement to recognise the group of insurance contracts from the time the entity accepts risk would mean that the entity would need to track and account for the group even before the coverage period begins.
Those expressing that view stated that accounting for the group of insurance contracts before the coverage period begins would require system changes whose high costs outweigh the benefits of doing so, particularly because the amount recognised before the coverage period begins might be immaterial, or even nil.
In the view of these respondents, even if amounts recognised before the coverage period begins are insignificant, requiring an entity to account for groups of insurance contracts in the pre-coverage period would impose on the entity the requirement to track groups to demonstrate that the amounts are insignificant.
the rationale described in paragraph BC141 for not recognising a group of insurance contracts in the pre-coverage period — ie tracking information before the coverage period begins does not generate benefits that outweigh costs — applies only to contracts before payments are due; and
the benefits of reporting insurance contracts that are onerous in the pre-coverage period outweigh the costs of recognising the contracts.
That approach ensures that entities recognise adverse changes in circumstances without the need to track groups before the coverage period begins.
BC145 The costs of originating insurance contracts are often incurred before the coverage period begins.
As discussed in paragraph BC176, the Board concluded that an entity should not recognise such costs as separate assets.
The Board observed that, in effect, entities will recognise groups from the date that the insurance acquisition cash flows are incurred.
That date may differ from the date on which the insurance contract is issued — for example, it may be the date that premiums become due.
The sections below discuss the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows, in particular
how an entity estimates the expected value of cash flows (see paragraphs BC147–BC157);
which cash flows should be included in the expected value of cash flows (see paragraphs BC158–BC184N);
how the cash flows are adjusted to reflect the time value of money and the financial risks, to the extent that the financial risks are not included in the estimates of future cash flows (see paragraphs BC185–BC205B); and
how the cash flows are adjusted to depict the effects of non-financial risk (see paragraphs BC206–BC217).
estimates that are consistent with available market information (see paragraphs BC153–BC154);
current estimates at the reporting date (see paragraphs BC155–BC156); and
explicit estimates (see paragraph BC157).
BC148 Because insurance contracts transfer risk, the cash flows generated by insurance contracts are uncertain.
Some argue that the measurement of insurance contracts should use a single estimate of the cash flows, for example, the most likely outcome or an outcome that is likely to prove 'sufficient' at an implicit or explicit level of confidence.
However, the Board decided that a measure of insurance contracts is most useful if it captures information about the full range of possible outcomes and their probabilities.
The expected present value is the probability-weighted mean of the present value of the possible cash flows.
In other words, the estimates should not be biased by the intention of attaining a predetermined result or inducing particular behaviour.
A lack of bias is important because biased financial reporting information cannot faithfully represent economic phenomena.
A lack of bias requires that estimates of cash flows and the associated probabilities should be neither conservative nor optimistic.
BC150 In principle, determining an expected present value involves the following steps
estimating the probability of that scenario occurring.
Consistent with the approach taken in IFRS 9, the Board decided to specify that an entity should use reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort in determining an expected present value.
Consequently, differences between the ultimate outcome and the previous estimate of expected value are not 'errors' or 'failures'.
However, such embedded options and guarantees also have a time value because they could be 'in the money' at expiry.
To the extent that those options and guarantees remain embedded in the insurance contract (see paragraphs BC104–BC107), the expected present value of future cash flows is an estimate based on all possible outcomes about cash flows.
The Board concluded that this measurement approach provides the most relevant information about embedded options and guarantees.
Estimates that are consistent with available market information (paragraphs 33(b) and B42–B53 of IFRS 17)
involve less subjectivity than measurements that use entity-specific expectations that differ from market consensus;
reflect all evidence available to market participants; and
are developed using a common and publicly accessible benchmark that users of financial statements can understand more easily than information developed using a private, internal benchmark.
an entity is required to use observable current market variables, such as interest rates, as direct inputs without adjustment when possible; and
when variables cannot be observed in, or derived directly from, market prices, the estimates should not contradict current market variables.
For example, estimated probabilities for inflation scenarios should not contradict probabilities implied by market interest rates.
Current estimates at the reporting date (paragraphs 33(c) and B54–B60 of IFRS 17)
However, the Board concluded that using current estimates
gives more relevant information about the entity's contractual obligations and rights by better reflecting information about the amounts, timing and uncertainty of the cash flows generated by those obligations and rights.
Because of the uncertainty associated with insurance contract liabilities and the long duration of many insurance contracts, current information reflecting the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows is particularly relevant for users of financial statements.
incorporates all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort in the measurement, thus avoiding the need for a separate test to ensure that the liability is not understated (sometimes known as a 'liability adequacy test').
Any liability adequacy test is likely to involve some arbitrary components.
For example, any specified timing for such a test would inevitably be arbitrary, unless current information were required at each reporting date.
is broadly consistent with other IFRS Standards for provisions (IAS 37) and financial liabilities (IFRS 9).
Consistent with these Standards, the Board concluded that an entity should include the effect of possible changes in legislation on future cash flows only when the change in legislation is substantively enacted.
Explicit estimates (paragraphs 33(d) and B46 of IFRS 17)
BC157 The Board concluded that explicit estimates of cash flows, which require an entity to consider actively whether circumstances have changed, result in more useful information about the entity's obligations to policyholders than estimates that combine cash flows with either the risk adjustment for non-financial risk or the adjustment to reflect the time value of money and financial risks.
Explicit estimates also reduce the possibility that the entity does not identify some changes in circumstances.
This exception applies if the entity uses the fair value of a replicating portfolio of assets to measure some of the cash flows that arise from insurance contracts, which will combine the cash flows and the adjustment to reflect the time value of money and financial risks.
The fair value of a replicating portfolio of assets reflects both the expected present value of the cash flows from the portfolio of assets and the risk associated with those cash flows (see paragraph B46 of IFRS 17).
BC158 This section discusses which cash flows should be included in the expected value of cash flows, including
cash flows that arise from future premiums (see paragraphs BC159–BC164);
deposit floors (see paragraphs BC165–BC166);
cash flows over which the entity has discretion (see paragraphs BC167–BC170);
(ca) cash flows relating to policyholder taxes (see paragraph BC170A);
cash flows that affect or are affected by cash flows to policyholders of other contracts (see paragraphs BC171–BC174);
insurance acquisition cash flows (see paragraphs BC175–BC184K); and
pre-recognition cash flows other than insurance acquisition cash flows (see paragraphs BC184L–BC184N).
BC159 The measurement of a group of insurance contracts includes all the cash flows expected to result from the contracts in the group, reflecting estimates of policyholder behaviour.
Thus, to identify the future cash flows that will arise as the entity fulfils its obligations, it is necessary to draw a contract boundary that distinguishes whether future premiums, and the resulting benefits and claims, arise from
If so, those future premiums, and the resulting benefits and claims, are included in the measurement of the group of insurance contracts; or
If so, those future premiums, and the resulting benefits and claims, are not included in the measurement of the group of existing insurance contracts.
If both parties are bound equally, the boundary of the contract is generally clear.
Similarly, if neither party is bound, it is clear that no genuine contract exists.
Thus, any cash flows arising beyond that point occur beyond the boundary of the existing contract and relate to a future contract, not to the existing contract.
Thus, that point would lie within the boundary of the existing contract, unless the restriction on the entity's ability to reprice the contract is so minimal that it is expected to have no commercial substance (ie the restriction has no discernible effect on the economics of the transaction).
In the Board's view, a restriction with no commercial substance does not bind the entity.
This would be the case if the contract charges level premiums and the risks covered by the contract increase with time.
In this case, the insurance contract binds the entity by requiring it to provide the policyholder with something of value: continuing insurance coverage without the need to undergo underwriting again.
Although the terms of the contract are such that the policyholder has a benefit in renewing the contract, and thus the entity expects that renewals will occur, the contract does not require the policyholder to renew the contract.
The Board originally decided that ignoring the entity's expectation of renewals would not reflect the economic circumstances created by the contract for the entity.
Consequently, the Board originally proposed that if the entity can reprice an existing contract for general but not individual-specific changes in policyholders' risk profiles, the cash flows resulting from the renewals repriced in this way lie within the boundaries of the existing contract.
BC163 Many stakeholders suggested that the original proposal in paragraph BC162(c) resulted in some cash flows for which the entity was not bound being included within the boundary of some contracts.
Even when an entity is prevented from repricing an existing contract using an individual policyholder's risk assessment, the entity may nonetheless be able to reprice a portfolio to which the contract belongs with the result that the price charged for the portfolio as a whole fully reflects the risk of the portfolio.
As a result, these stakeholders argued that in such cases the entity is no longer bound by the existing portfolio of contracts and that any cash flows that arise beyond that repricing point should be considered to be beyond the boundary of the existing contract.
To the extent that an entity would not be able to charge a price that fully reflects the risks of the portfolio as a whole, it would be bound by the existing contract.
For example, in one reporting period an entity may decide that a renewal premium for a portfolio of contracts is outside the contract boundary because the restriction on the entity's ability to reprice the contract has no commercial substance.
However, if circumstances change so that the same restrictions on the entity's ability to reprice the portfolio take on commercial substance, the entity may conclude that future renewal premiums for that portfolio of contracts are within the boundary of the contract.
Such a requirement would contradict the principle that an entity should incorporate in the measurement of an insurance contract future cash flows on a probability-weighted basis.
Cash flows over which the entity has discretion (paragraph B65 of IFRS 17)
Those reasons could be to maintain the entity's competitive position or because the entity believes it is under some moral pressure.
Thus, it could be difficult to make a reasonable estimate of the level of distribution that would ultimately be enforceable in the unlikely event that an entity asserts that its discretion to pay or withhold amounts to policyholders is unfettered.
That amount does not provide relevant information about the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows.
On the other hand, users of financial statements would want to know
how much of the cash flows will be unavailable to investors because the entity expects to pay them to policyholders.
how much of the risk in the contracts is borne by the policyholders through the participation mechanism and how much by the shareholders.
This information is conveyed by the required disclosures about risk.
However, in the Board's view, including such components in the measurement of insurance contracts would generate more useful information for users of financial statements.
It concluded that it would not.
The Board agreed that any costs specifically chargeable to the policyholder are cash flows that will arise as the entity fulfils an insurance contract.
Cash flows that affect or are affected by cash flows to policyholders of other contracts (paragraphs B67–B71 in IFRS 17)
This effect is sometimes called 'mutualisation'.
However, that term is used in practice to refer to a variety of effects, ranging from the effects of specific contractual terms to general risk diversification.
That means that some of the amounts based on underlying items may be paid to policyholders of contracts that will be issued in the future that share in the returns on the same underlying items, rather than to existing policyholders.
From the entity's perspective, the terms of the existing contract require it to pay the amounts, even though it does not yet know when or to whom it will make the payments.
BC175 Entities often incur significant costs to sell, underwrite and start new insurance contracts. These costs are commonly referred to as 'insurance acquisition cash flows'.
Insurance contracts are generally priced to recover those costs through premiums or through surrender charges, or both.
Such models treat insurance acquisition cash flows as a representation of the cost of a recognisable asset, which, depending on the model, might be described as a contract asset or a customer relationship intangible asset.
The Board noted that an entity typically charges the policyholder a price the entity regards as sufficient to compensate it for undertaking the obligation to pay for insured losses and for the cost of originating the contracts.
Thus, a faithful representation of the remaining obligation to pay for insured losses should not include the part of the premium intended to compensate for the cost of originating the contracts.
Because insurance revenue is recognised in the same pattern as changes in the liability for remaining coverage, this would mean that some of the insurance revenue would be recognised when the insurance acquisition cash flows are paid, often at the beginning of the coverage period.
At all times, the liability for the group is measured as the sum of the fulfilment cash flows, including any expected future insurance acquisition cash flows, and the contractual service margin.
Insurance acquisition cash flows included in measurement
Those cash flows can be clearly identified as relating specifically to the contract.
For example, there would be different liabilities reported if the entity had an internal sales department rather than outsourcing sales to external agents.
In the Board's view, differences in the structure of insurance acquisition activities would not necessarily reflect economic differences between insurance contracts issued by the entities.
The entity measures and manages these costs for the portfolio, rather than for the individual contract.
Accordingly, including insurance acquisition cash flows that are incremental at the portfolio level in the fulfilment cash flows of the insurance contracts would be consistent with identification of other cash flows that are included in the measurement of the contracts.
In this context, excluding some insurance acquisition cash flows that relate to issuing a portfolio of contracts would result in an understatement of the fulfilment cash flows and an overstatement of the contractual service margins of groups in the portfolio.
In addition, the Board wanted to avoid measuring liabilities and expenses at different amounts depending on how an entity structures its insurance acquisition activities, as described in paragraph BC182(a).
BC184B Before the amendment, an entity was required to allocate insurance acquisition cash flows directly attributable to a group to only that group.
The entity agrees to those costs because it expects that some policyholders will renew their contracts.
Often, those costs are fully directly attributable to the initial insurance contract issued because those costs are non-refundable and are not contingent on the policyholder renewing the contracts.
In the Board's view, an entity recognising a loss in that circumstance would provide useful information to users of financial statements.
The information would reflect that the entity does not have a right to either oblige policyholders to renew the contracts, or to reclaim the commissions from sales agents if policyholders choose not to renew the contracts.
Such a requirement depicts the payment of up-front costs such as commissions as an asset that an entity expects to recover through both initial insurance contracts issued and expected renewals.
The asset reflects the right of an entity to not pay again costs it had already paid to obtain renewals.
BC184F The Board concluded it did not need to develop requirements to specify how to allocate insurance acquisition cash flows to expected renewals.
The Board also decided to clarify that an entity must apply a consistent method across reporting periods by referring in the requirements to a systematic and rational method (rather than a systematic and rational basis).
The amendment will therefore increase the carrying amount of assets for insurance acquisition cash flows.
Accordingly, the Board considered whether it should specify requirements for
accretion of interest on assets for insurance acquisition cash flows.
assessments of the recoverability of assets for insurance acquisition cash flows.
The Board decided to specify such requirements for the reasons set out in paragraphs BC184I–BC184K.
The asset was typically of relatively short duration and any lack of recoverability would be reflected on a timely basis when the asset was derecognised and the insurance acquisition cash flows were included in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts (see paragraph BC180).
BC184K The Board noted that an entity measures an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows at the level of a group of insurance contracts.
An impairment test at a group level compares the carrying amount of an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows allocated to a group with the expected net cash inflow of the group.
That net cash inflow includes cash flows for contracts unrelated to any expected renewals but expected to be in that group.
The Board therefore decided to require an additional impairment test specific to cash flows for expected renewals.
This additional impairment test results in the recognition of any impairment losses when the entity no longer expects the renewals supporting the asset to occur, or expects the net cash inflows to be lower than the amount of the asset.
Without the additional impairment test, cash flows from contracts unrelated to any expected renewals might prevent the recognition of such an impairment loss.
Such assets and liabilities might have been recognised before the group of insurance contracts is recognised because the cash flows occur or because a liability is recognised applying another IFRS Standard.
Cash flows are related to a group of insurance contracts if they would have been included in the fulfilment cash flows at the date of initial recognition of the group had they been paid or received after that date.
BC184M The Board agreed with feedback that such cash flows should be included in the determination of the contractual service margin and insurance revenue for the group of insurance contracts.
These cash flows should affect profit and revenue in the same way as the fulfilment cash flows regardless of their timing (or of the timing of their recognition as a liability).
BC184N The amendment requires an entity to derecognise any asset or liability for such cash flows when the entity recognises the related group of insurance contracts to the extent that the asset or liability would not have been recognised separately from the group of insurance contracts if the cash flows (or the event that triggered their recognition as a liability) had occurred at the date of initial recognition of the group of insurance contracts.
In addition the Board concluded that, to be consistent with the recognition of insurance revenue and incurred expenses required by IFRS 17, to the extent that an asset is derecognised when the entity recognises the related group of insurance contracts, insurance revenue and expenses should be recognised.
In contrast, no insurance revenue or expenses arise on the derecognition of a liability at that date.
The derecognition of a liability results either in the amounts expected to settle the liability being included in the fulfilment cash flows or the performance obligation depicted by the liability being subsumed within the recognition of the group of insurance contracts.
For example, an entity that recognised a liability for premiums received in advance of the recognition of a group of insurance contracts would derecognise that liability when the entity recognises a group of insurance contracts to the extent the premiums relate to the contracts in the group.
The performance obligation that was depicted by the liability would not be recognised separately from the group of insurance contracts had the premiums been received on the date of the initial recognition of the group.
No insurance revenue arises on the derecognition of the liability.
whether the measurement of all insurance contracts should be discounted (see paragraphs BC186–BC191);
current, market-consistent estimates of the time value of money and financial risks, to the extent not included in the estimates of future cash flows (see paragraph BC192);
the approach taken in respect of liquidity and own credit risk factors in determining the discount rate for a group of insurance contracts (see paragraphs BC193–BC197);
disclosure of the yield curve (see paragraph BC198);
reflecting dependence on underlying items in the discount rate (see paragraphs BC199–BC205); and
The Board concluded that the measurement of all insurance contracts should reflect the effect of the timing of cash flows, because such a measure gives more relevant information about the entity's financial position.
Some suggested that measuring non-life insurance contracts at a discounted amount would produce information that is less reliable (ie has more measurement uncertainty) than measuring it at its undiscounted amount because non-life insurance contracts are more uncertain than life insurance contracts with respect to
whether the insured event will occur, whereas the insured event in some life insurance contracts is certain to occur unless the policy lapses;
the amount of the future payment that would be required if an insured event occurs, whereas the future payment obligation is generally specified in, or readily determinable from, a life insurance contract; and
the timing of any future payments required when the insured event occurs, whereas the timing of future payments in a life insurance contract is typically more predictable.
Some stakeholders argued that estimating the timing of payments and calculating a discount rate would introduce additional subjectivity into the measurement of insurance contracts and that this could reduce comparability and permit earnings management.
Furthermore, these stakeholders stated that the benefits of presenting a discounted measure of non-life insurance contracts might not justify the costs of preparing that measure.
These stakeholders stated that the timing of cash flows and the resulting interest is an essential component of the pricing and profitability of life insurance contracts, but is less relevant for non-life insurance contracts for which the stakeholders viewed underwriting results as the most critical component of pricing and profitability.
BC189 These arguments did not persuade the Board. Measuring a group of insurance contracts using undiscounted cash flows would fail to represent faithfully the entity's financial position and would be less relevant to users of financial statements than a measurement that includes the discounted amounts.
The Board is of the view that the measurement uncertainty caused by discounting does not outweigh the additional relevance of the resulting measurement of the entity's obligations.
Furthermore, many entities have experience in discounting, both to support investment decisions and to measure items for which other IFRS Standards require discounting, such as financial instruments, employee benefit obligations and long-term non-financial liabilities.
Additionally, the Board has learned that, for internal managerial purposes, some insurance entities discount some of their non-life insurance portfolios or groups of insurance contracts.
As this is unlikely, the Board concluded that financial reporting will be improved if entities estimate those effects separately.
Factors to include in the discount rate (paragraphs B78–B85 of IFRS 17)
Many entities use highly liquid, high-quality bonds as a proxy for risk-free rates.
a holding in an underlying non-tradable investment, paying a higher return than the observed return on the traded bond; and
an embedded option to sell the investment to a market participant, for which the holder pays an implicit premium through a reduction in the overall return.
In contrast, for many insurance contracts, the entity cannot be forced to make payments earlier than the occurrence of insured events, or dates specified in the contract.
BC194 The Board concluded that, in principle, the discount rate for a group of insurance contracts should reflect the liquidity characteristics of the items being measured. Thus, the discount rate should equal the return on the underlying non-tradable investment (see paragraph BC193(a)), because the entity cannot sell or put the contract liability without significant cost.
There should be no deduction in the rate for the implicit premium for the embedded put option, because no such put option is present in the liability.
to ignore the liquidity characteristics of the item being measured, or to use an arbitrary benchmark (for example, high-quality corporate bonds) as an attempt to develop a practical proxy for measuring the specific liquidity characteristics of the item being measured; or
to provide detailed guidance on how to estimate liquidity adjustments.
a 'bottom-up' approach based on highly liquid, high-quality bonds, adjusted to include a premium for the illiquidity.
a 'top-down' approach based on the expected returns of a reference portfolio, adjusted to eliminate factors that are not relevant to the liability, for example market and credit risk.
The Board expects a reference portfolio will typically have liquidity characteristics closer to the liquidity characteristics of the group of insurance contracts than highly liquid, high-quality bonds.
Because of the difficulty in assessing liquidity premiums, the Board decided that in applying a top-down approach an entity need not make an adjustment for any remaining differences in liquidity characteristics between the reference portfolio and the insurance contracts.
Some stakeholders expressed the view that information about own credit risk relating to a liability that must be fulfilled by the issuer, and about gains and losses arising from changes in the issuer's own credit risk, is not relevant for users of financial statements.
The Board concluded that including the effect of a change in the entity's own non-performance risk in the measurement of an insurance contract liability would not provide useful information.
The Board considered concerns that excluding own credit risk could lead to accounting mismatches, because the fair value of the assets viewed as backing insurance contracts includes changes in credit risk on those assets, while the measurement of a group of insurance contracts would exclude changes in the credit risk of the group of contracts.
The Board decided that disclosure of the yield curves used will allow users of financial statements to understand how those yield curves might differ from entity to entity.
Proponents of such approaches stated that doing so
prevents losses arising at initial recognition for groups of insurance contracts that are expected to be profitable overall and so reflects the most likely outcome of the insurance activity as a whole, taking into consideration the underwriting and investment functions together.
prevents the volatility that would arise if short-term fluctuations in asset spreads affect the measurement of the assets, but not the measurement of the liabilities.
Because an entity holds those assets for the long term to fulfil its obligations under the insurance contracts it has issued, some say that those fluctuations make it more difficult for users of financial statements to assess an entity's long-term performance.
Further, the Board noted that, to the extent that market spreads affect assets and insurance contracts differently, useful information is provided about economic mismatches, particularly about duration mismatches.
The objective of the discount rate is to adjust estimated future cash flows for the time value of money and for financial risks (for example, the liquidity risk), to the extent that they are not included in the estimated cash flows, in a way that captures the characteristics of the contract.
to the extent that the cash flows from assets (or other underlying items) affect the cash flows that arise from the liability, the appropriate discount rate should reflect the dependence on the underlying items; and
to the extent that the cash flows that arise from the contracts are expected not to vary with returns on underlying items, the appropriate discount rate should exclude any factors that influence the underlying items that are irrelevant to the contracts.
Such factors include risks that are not present in the contracts but are present in the financial instrument for which the market prices are observed.
Thus, the discount rate should not capture all of the characteristics of those assets, even if the entity views those assets as backing those contracts.
variable in scenarios in which the guarantee amount is lower than the proportion of returns on underlying items promised to the policyholder; and
fixed in scenarios in which the guaranteed amount is higher than the proportion of returns on underlying items promised to the policyholder.
Accordingly, an asset-based discount rate (from assets with variable returns) would be inappropriate for such cash flows.
BC204 The Board noted that a link between cash flows and underlying items could be captured by using replicating portfolio techniques, or portfolio techniques that have similar outcomes (see paragraphs B46–B48 of IFRS 17).
A replicating portfolio is a theoretical portfolio of assets providing cash flows that exactly match the cash flows from the liability in all scenarios.
If a replicating portfolio existed and could be measured directly, there would be no need to determine separately the cash flows and the discount rate for the part of the liability replicated by that portfolio.
The measurements of the replicating portfolio and the replicated cash flows arising from the contracts would be identical.
BC205 However, the Board also noted that using a replicating portfolio technique might require splitting the cash flows of the insurance contracts into those that match the cash flows from the asset portfolio and those that do not.
As discussed in paragraph BC261, many stakeholders argued that it is impossible to split the cash flows in this way.
BC205A When the Board considered feedback from entities implementing IFRS 17, it also considered feedback from users of financial statements that the principle-based requirements for determining discount rates could limit comparability between entities.
In the Board's view, requiring an entity to determine discount rates using a rule-based approach would result in outcomes that are appropriate only in some circumstances.
The risk adjustment for non-financial risk directly measures the non-financial risk in the contract.
the reasons for including a risk adjustment for non-financial risk in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts (see paragraphs BC208–BC212);
the techniques for estimating the risk adjustment for non-financial risk (see paragraphs BC213–BC214C); and
the requirement to disclose a confidence level equivalent (see paragraphs BC215–BC217).
BC209 In developing the objective of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, the Board concluded that a risk adjustment for non-financial risk should not represent
the compensation that a market participant would require for bearing the non-financial risk that is associated with the contract.
As noted in paragraph BC17, the measurement model is not intended to measure the current exit value or fair value, which reflects the transfer of the liability to a market participant.
Consequently, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk should be determined as the amount of compensation that the entity — not a market participant — would require.
an amount that would provide a high degree of certainty that the entity would be able to fulfil the contract.
Although such an amount might be appropriate for some regulatory purposes, it is not compatible with the Board's objective of providing information that will help users of financial statements make decisions about providing resources to the entity.
no single well-defined approach exists for developing risk adjustments for non-financial risks that would meet the objective described in paragraph BC208 and provide consistency and comparability of results.
some techniques are difficult to explain to users of financial statements and, for some techniques, it may be difficult to provide clear disclosures that would give users of financial statements an insight into the measure of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that results from the technique.
it is impossible to assess retrospectively whether a particular adjustment was reasonable, although preparers of financial statements may, in time, develop tools that help them to assess whether the amount of a risk adjustment for non-financial risk is appropriate for a given fact pattern.
Over time, an entity may be able to assess whether subsequent outcomes are in line with its previous estimates of probability distributions.
However, it would be difficult for the entity to assess whether, for example, a decision to set a confidence level at a particular percentile was appropriate.
developing systems to determine risk adjustments for non-financial risk will involve cost, and some stakeholders doubt whether the benefits of such systems will be sufficient to justify that cost.
if the remeasurement of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk for an existing group of insurance contracts results in a loss, that loss will reverse in later periods as the entity is released from that risk.
Reporting a loss followed by an expected reversal of that loss may confuse some users of financial statements.
the risk adjustment for non-financial risk could be used to introduce bias into the measurement of an insurance contract.
It will convey useful information to users of financial statements about the entity's view of the economic burden imposed by the non-financial risk associated with the entity's insurance contracts.
will result in a profit recognition pattern that reflects both the profit recognised by bearing risk and the profit recognised by providing services.
As a result, the profit recognition pattern is more sensitive to the economic drivers of the contract.
will faithfully represent circumstances in which the entity has charged insufficient premiums for bearing the risk that the claims might ultimately exceed expected premiums.
will report changes in estimates of risk promptly and in an understandable way.
For example, the average risk in a group of claims liabilities may rise over time because more complex claims incurred may take longer to resolve.
Similarly, lapse risk may affect cash inflows more than it affects cash outflows.
Techniques for measuring risk adjustments for non-financial risk (paragraphs B90–B92 of IFRS 17)
Specifying a level of aggregation for determining the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that was inconsistent with the entity's view of the burden of non-financial risk would contradict the objective of reflecting the entity's perception in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.
Accordingly, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk reflects any diversification benefit the entity considers when determining the amount of compensation it requires for bearing that uncertainty.
Transition Resource Group members held different views.
Some members thought the risk adjustment for non-financial risk for a group of insurance contracts must be the same in the issuing subsidiary's stand-alone financial statements as in the consolidated financial statements of the group of entities.
Other members thought the risk adjustment for non-financial risk may be measured differently in the issuing subsidiary's stand-alone financial statements from how it is measured in the consolidated financial statements of the group of entities.
BC214C The Board considered whether it should clarify its intention for determining the risk adjustment for non-financial risk in the consolidated financial statements of a group of entities in response to those different views.
The Board concluded that doing so would address only some differences that could arise in the application of the requirements for determining the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, given the judgement required to apply those requirements.
The Board concluded that practice needs to develop in this area.
However, the Board did not identify any other approaches that would provide quantitative disclosure that would allow users of financial statements to compare the risk adjustments for non-financial risk using a consistent methodology across entities.
In particular, the Board noted that this objective would not be achieved by
disclosing the range of values of key inputs used to measure the risk adjustment for non-financial risk from a market participant's perspective; or
providing information about the relative magnitude of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk compared to total insurance contract liabilities.
BC217 The Board also considered whether a different technique, such as the cost of capital approach, should be used as the basis for comparison.
Although the usefulness of the confidence level technique diminishes when the probability distribution is not statistically normal, which is often the case for insurance contracts, the cost of capital approach would be more complicated to calculate than would the confidence level disclosure.
Also, the confidence level technique has the benefit of being relatively easy to communicate to users of financial statements and relatively easy to understand.
The Board expects that many entities will have the information necessary to apply the cost of capital technique because that information will be required to comply with local regulatory requirements.
However, the Board decided not to impose the more onerous requirements on entities when a simpler approach would be sufficient.
BC218 The contractual service margin depicts the unearned profit the entity expects to generate from a group of insurance contracts (see paragraph BC21).
The contractual service margin is determined on initial recognition of a group as the amount that eliminates any gains arising at that time.
Subsequent adjustments to the carrying amount of the contractual service margin and its recognition in profit or loss determine how profit and revenue are recognised over the coverage period of the group.
changes in estimates of the future unearned profit (see paragraphs BC222–BC269);
insurance finance income or expenses (see paragraphs BC270–BC276E); and
currency exchange differences (see paragraphs BC277–BC278).
BC222 The key service provided by insurance contracts is insurance coverage, but contracts may also provide investment-related or other services.
The measurement of a group of insurance contracts at initial recognition includes a contractual service margin, which represents the margin the entity has charged for the services it provides in addition to bearing risk.
The expected margin charged for bearing risk is represented by the risk adjustment for non-financial risk (see paragraphs BC206–BC214C).
Thus, adjusting the contractual service margin to reflect these changes provides more relevant information about the remaining unearned profit in the group of insurance contracts after initial recognition than not adjusting the contractual service margin.
Paragraphs BC227–BC237 discuss which changes in estimates relate to future service for insurance contracts without direct participation features, and paragraphs BC238–BC256H discuss which changes relate to future service for insurance contracts with direct participation features.
If the contractual service margin were not adjusted for changes in estimates relating to future service, the estimates made at initial recognition would determine the contractual service margin, but changes in those estimates thereafter would not.
Favourable changes in estimates — whether lower than expected cash outflows, higher than expected cash inflows or reductions in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk — increase the profit that the entity will recognise from the group.
Any excess of the increase in the fulfilment cash flows over the contractual service margin means the group is expected to be onerous (ie loss-making) rather than profit-making in the future.
Such losses are recognised as an increase in the liability and corresponding expense in the period.
Consistent with viewing the contractual service margin as unearned future profit, changes that relate to current or past periods do not affect the contractual service margin.
Except in the case of onerous groups of insurance contracts as explained in (b), any changes are recognised in profit or loss when the contractual service margin is recognised over the current period and the coverage period remaining after the adjustments are made.
Revisions in estimates that adjust the contractual service margin result in a transfer between the components of the insurance contract liability, with no change in the total carrying amount of the liability.
This remeasurement requirement is consistent with the measurement of contract liabilities under IFRS 15, which also does not remeasure performance obligations based on changes in estimates of future cash flows unless a contract is onerous.
Other approaches considered but rejected
Not adjusting the contractual service margin for subsequent changes in the future cash flows and risk adjustment for non-financial risk
Changes in the estimates of the payments required to fulfil the contracts do not increase or decrease the obligation to provide services and consequently do not adjust the measurement of that obligation.
Those with this view argued that it would be inconsistent to prohibit the recognition of gains on initial recognition, but then to require the subsequent recognition of gains on the basis of changes in estimates made immediately after initial recognition.
The Board, persuaded by these views, accordingly decided to adjust the contractual service margin for changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service.
Time value of money and changes in assumptions relating to financial risk (paragraph B97(a) of IFRS 17)
Accordingly, the entity does not adjust the contractual service margin to reflect the effects of changes in these assumptions.
BC229 For insurance contracts without direct participation features, the underwriting result is regarded as the difference between the amount of premiums the entity charges (less any investment component) and the payments the entity makes because of the occurrence of the insured event.
The insurance finance result reflects the interest arising on the group of insurance contracts because of the passage of time and the effect of changes in assumptions relating to financial risk.
Such gains and losses would be recognised in profit or loss according to other applicable IFRS Standards.
BC230 Thus, for insurance contracts without direct participation features, the entity's profit from financing activities arises from the difference between
the gains (or losses) from the investments; and
the change in the insurance contract liability depicted by the insurance finance income or expenses including the gains (or losses) the entity passes to the policyholder through any indirect participation mechanism.
in most cases, an entity would be unlikely to have a legally enforceable right to set off the insurance contract liability with the investment portfolio, even if the investment portfolio were to be invested in assets that exactly match the entity's obligation, because the entity retains the obligation to pay the policyholders the amounts that are determined on the basis of the investments in the portfolio, irrespective of the entity's investment strategy.
Experience adjustments and changes in assumptions that do not relate to financial risk (Appendix A and paragraphs B96–B97 of IFRS 17)
BC232 The Board decided that all changes in estimates of the liability for incurred claims relate to current or past service because they relate to coverage in previous periods.
The Board noted that experience adjustments relating to premiums received for future coverage relate to future service and are an exception to this general rule.
However, in other cases, the experience adjustment and the change in the estimates of the future cash flows do not offset each other and recognising the experience adjustment in profit or loss in the current period while adjusting the contractual service margin for the change in the estimates of the future cash flows appropriately depicts both effects.
The Board did not regard as useful information, for example, the recognition of a gain for a delay in repaying an investment component accompanied by a loss that adjusts the contractual service margin for the expected later repayment.
Acceleration or delay in repayments of investment components only gives rise to a gain or loss for the entity to the extent that the amount of the repayment is affected by its timing.
Discretionary cash flows (paragraphs B98–B100 of IFRS 17)
The Board noted that there are potentially many ways in which an entity could make that distinction.
the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;
the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns from the underlying items; and
the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.
BC239 The Board views these contracts as creating an obligation to pay policyholders an amount equal in value to specified underlying items, minus a variable fee for service.
That fee is an amount equal to the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items minus any expected cash flows that do not vary directly with the underlying items.
the entity's share of the underlying items; and
As explained in paragraphs BC228–BC231, the Board concluded that for many insurance contracts it is appropriate to depict the gains and losses on any investment portfolio related to the contracts in the same way as gains and losses on an investment portfolio unrelated to insurance contracts.
However, the Board also considered a contrasting view that, for some contracts, the returns to the entity from a pool of underlying items should be viewed as the compensation that the entity charges the policyholder for service provided by the insurance contract, rather than as a share of returns from an unrelated investment.
Under this contrasting view, changes in the estimate of the entity's share of returns are regarded as a change in the entity's compensation for the contract.
Such changes in the entity's compensation should be recognised over the periods in which the entity provides the service promised in the contract, in the same way that changes in the estimates of the costs of providing the contract are recognised.
In addition, the Board also observed that the entity is often constrained when exercising its control over the underlying items because
the quantum of underlying items is determined entirely by the premiums paid by the policyholder;
the entity is usually expected to manage the policyholder's invested premiums for the benefit of the policyholders, acting for them in a fiduciary capacity; and
some aspects of the entity's management of the underlying items might be specified in the contract.
a variable fee that the entity deducts in exchange for the services provided by the insurance contract.
In such cases, the fact that the fee for the contract is determined by reference to a share of the returns on the underlying items is incidental to its nature as a fee.
The Board concluded, therefore, that depicting the gains and losses on the entity's share of the underlying items as part of a variable fee for service faithfully represents the nature of the contractual arrangement.
For this to be the case, the contract needs to specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items.
Without a determinable fee, which can be expressed as a percentage of portfolio returns or portfolio asset values rather than only as a monetary amount, the share of returns on the underlying items the entity retains would be entirely at the discretion of the entity, and, in the Board's view, this would not be consistent with that amount being equivalent to a fee.
the entity should expect to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items.
It would not be a faithful representation to depict an obligation to pay an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items if the policyholder does not expect to receive a substantial part of the fair value returns on the underlying items.
the entity should expect a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.
It would not be a faithful representation to depict an obligation to pay an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items if the entity were not to expect changes in the amount to be paid to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.
The Board also decided that the entity need not hold the underlying items, because the measurement of insurance contracts should not depend on what assets the entity holds.
The Board extended the adjustments to the contractual service margin as described in paragraphs BC239–BC240 to reflect the view that the entity's share of underlying items is part of the variable fee for service.
In such cases, variability in the fee is driven by changes in assumptions relating to financial risk.
BC249B The Board considered but rejected the suggestions described in paragraph BC249A(a).
The additional adjustments to the contractual service margin in the variable fee approach were designed specifically to faithfully represent the profit from insurance contracts within the scope of the variable fee approach.
Therefore, if the Board were to amend the scope of the variable fee approach, it would need to consider amending those adjustments.
The Board also observed that whatever the scope of the variable fee approach, differences would arise between the accounting for contracts within the scope and contracts outside the scope.
The Board concluded that reinsurance contracts are not substantially investment-related service contracts.
The variable fee approach was designed specifically so an entity issuing insurance contracts that are substantially investment-related service contracts would account for profit similarly to an entity issuing asset management contracts.
Some stakeholders said that excluding reinsurance contracts held from the scope of the variable fee approach creates an accounting mismatch when a reinsurance contract held covers underlying insurance contracts that are within the scope of the variable fee approach.
The Board responded to that concern by amending the risk mitigation option (see paragraphs BC256A–BC256B).
Applying paragraph B101 of IFRS 17, an entity assesses whether an insurance contract (rather than a group of insurance contracts) is within the scope of the variable fee approach.
Those stakeholders had assumed that an entity was required to apply the criteria for the scope of the variable fee approach at a group level.
The Board noted that some stakeholders had interpreted a contract-level assessment as being more burdensome than it is because they thought an individual assessment was required for every contract.
Effect of risk mitigation (paragraphs B115–B118 of IFRS 17)
An entity is also at risk from possible changes in its share of the fair value returns on underlying items.
BC251 For contracts without direct participation features, the contractual service margin is not adjusted for the changes in fulfilment cash flows the derivatives are intended to mitigate.
If the entity chooses to recognise all insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss, there will be no accounting mismatch between the recognition of the change in the value of the derivative and the recognition of the change in the carrying amount of the insurance contract.
Consequently, the change in the value of the derivative would be recognised in profit or loss, but, unless the group of insurance contracts was onerous, there would be no equivalent change in the carrying amount to recognise, creating an accounting mismatch.
an economic offset exists between the group of insurance contracts and the derivative, ie the values of the group of insurance contracts and the derivative generally move in opposite directions because they respond in a similar way to the changes in the risk being mitigated.
An entity does not consider accounting measurement differences in assessing the economic offset.
BC256 The Board considered an alternative approach to reducing accounting mismatches arising from such derivatives. This approach would have allowed an entity to recognise in profit or loss the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative that matches the critical terms of the specified fulfilment cash flows or the entity's share of the fair value return on the underlying items.
However, the Board concluded that such an approach would involve too much additional complexity.
The entity accounts for the underlying insurance contracts issued, but not the reinsurance contract held, applying the variable fee approach.
Reinsurance contracts that cover insurance contracts with direct participation features transfer both non-financial and financial risk to the reinsurer.
The Board considered but rejected a suggestion to permit an entity to apply the variable fee approach to such reinsurance contracts held (see paragraph BC249C).
However, the Board acknowledged that when an entity mitigates the effect of financial risk using a reinsurance contract held, an accounting mismatch could arise that is similar to the mismatch that could arise when an entity mitigates the effect of financial risk using derivatives (see paragraph BC252).
The Board was persuaded that if such non-derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss, an accounting mismatch could arise, which is similar to the accounting mismatch for derivatives (see paragraph BC252).
Accordingly, the Board extended the risk mitigation option to apply in such circumstances.
The Board decided to limit the extension to only non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
For such non-derivative financial instruments, the extension resolves the accounting mismatch in the same way it resolves the accounting mismatch for derivatives (which are also measured at fair value through profit or loss).
BC256D The Board considered but rejected a suggestion that an entity should be permitted to apply the risk mitigation option when it uses non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
The Board observed that in most circumstances the risk mitigation option would not resolve perceived mismatches between amounts recognised in profit or loss relating to
assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
BC256F The Board also considered but rejected a suggestion that an entity should be permitted to apply the risk mitigation option when it uses non-derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of financial risk on the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items (see paragraph B112 of IFRS 17).
Some stakeholders said that an entity may mitigate such financial risk by investing premiums in assets other than the underlying items—for example, fixed rate bonds.
The Board concluded that permitting an entity to apply the risk mitigation option in that circumstance would contradict the principle that an entity need not hold the underlying items for the variable fee approach to apply (see paragraph BC246).
Instead, the Board specified that such insurance finance income or expenses are presented in
profit or loss if the entity mitigates financial risk using financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss; and
profit or loss or other comprehensive income applying the same accounting policy the entity applies to a reinsurance contract held if the entity mitigates financial risk using that reinsurance contract held.
BC256H The amendment described in paragraph BC256G resolves a mismatch that would otherwise have arisen between amounts recognised in profit or loss for a group of insurance contracts with direct participation features and amounts recognised in profit or loss on the items used to mitigate financial risk arising from the insurance contracts.
BC257 Treating insurance contracts with direct participation features differently from insurance contracts without direct participation features adds complexity for preparers and users of financial statements. Preparers have to determine the category in which their insurance contracts belong, and users need to understand the implications of the different accounting requirements.
The Board noted that the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows is the same for both types of contract, and the differences are limited to the treatment of the contractual service margin.
The Board was persuaded that those differences are necessary to provide a faithful representation of the different nature of the types of contract.
Adjusting the contractual service margin by changes in the carrying amount of underlying items for all contracts
BC258 Some stakeholders advocated adjusting the contractual service margin for changes in the carrying amount of underlying items whenever the insurance contracts require the amounts paid to policyholders to vary with returns on underlying items.
However, the Board rejected that broad application of the variable fee concept, after deciding that it is useful only for insurance contracts that are substantially investment-related service contracts.
The essence of the mirroring approach was that, to the extent that an entity expects to settle fulfilment cash flows payable to policyholders with assets or other underlying items it holds, the entity would measure those fulfilment cash flows just as it measures the underlying items.
All other cash flows would be measured using the general requirements.
However, not all cash flows in an insurance contract will vary directly with returns on underlying items.
In particular, many stakeholders stated that it would be difficult for entities to separate and measure separately the different components of the insurance contract.
Some suggested that any decomposition of interrelated cash flows would be arbitrary and that separate measurement would lead to different valuations of an insurance contract depending on arbitrary decisions.
BC262 Many stakeholders were also concerned because the mirroring proposals would mean that the measurement outcome for some participating contracts would differ markedly from the measurement outcome for other insurance contracts based on only subtle differences in the characteristics of the contracts.
In addition, some preparers and regulators were concerned that when the underlying items are measured at cost, the carrying value of the insurance contract would not be a current value.
As a result, mirroring would widen the difference between the liability measured for financial reporting purposes and the liability recognised for regulatory purposes.
Insurers that are mutual entities
They argued that mirroring was necessary for such insurers because the effect of accounting mismatches between assets that cannot be measured at fair value and fulfilment cash flows measured at current value can have a particularly significant effect on their reported financial position and financial performance.
BC265 A defining feature of an insurer that is a mutual entity is that the most residual interest of the entity is due to a policyholder and not a shareholder.
When applying IFRS 17, payments to policyholders form part of the fulfilment cash flows regardless of whether those payments are expected to be made to current or future policyholders.
Thus, the fulfilment cash flows of an insurer that is a mutual entity generally include the rights of policyholders to the whole of any surplus of assets over liabilities.
Insurance contracts are measured at current value, which, for an insurer that is a mutual entity, incorporates information about the fair value of the other assets and liabilities of the entity.
Many of these other assets and liabilities are not required to be measured at fair value in applying IFRS Standards; for example, amortised cost financial assets, deferred tax balances, goodwill in subsidiaries and pension scheme surpluses and deficits.
Comparability across entities is enhanced if economically similar products are accounted for in a similar way regardless of the legal form of the entity holding or issuing the product.
In addition, the Board noted that applying the mirroring approach would mean that part of the fulfilment cash flows of an insurer that is a mutual entity would not be measured at current value, which was a major concern about the mirroring approach for some regulators (see paragraph BC262).
in the statement of financial position, the liability attributable to policyholders in their capacity as policyholders from the liability attributable to policyholders with the most residual interest in the entity; and
Insurance finance income or expenses on the contractual service margin (paragraphs 44(b) and 45(b) of IFRS 17)
Some argued that the contractual service margin should not be adjusted for a financing effect on the grounds of simplicity and because they view the contractual service margin as being a deferred credit rather than a representation of a component of an obligation.
In the Board's view, on initial recognition the contractual service margin can be viewed as an allocation of part of the transaction price, which is the consideration paid or payable by the policyholder.
Calculating interest on the contractual service margin is consistent with IFRS 15, which requires an entity to adjust the promised consideration to reflect the time value of money if the contract has a significant financing component.
As a result of that adjustment, the transaction price would reflect the amount the customer would pay in cash for the promised good or service when they receive the good or service.
Consequently, an entity would recognise revenue at an amount that corresponds to the cash selling price of the good or service, with the effects of the financing presented separately from revenue (as interest expense or interest income).
Locking in the rate is consistent with the determination of the contractual service margin on initial recognition and making no adjustments for changes in assumptions relating to financial risk.
BC274 Some stakeholders argued that interest should be accreted at a current rate on the grounds that the current rate would be consistent with the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows. Also, a locked-in rate requires information about historical rates that would not otherwise be needed for entities not using the option to include insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss using a systematic allocation (see paragraphs BC42–BC44).
However, the Board noted that accreting interest on the contractual service margin for an accounting period at a current rate differs from measuring cash flows at a current rate.
The contractual service margin does not represent future cash flows; it represents the unearned profit in the contract, measured at the point of initial recognition and adjusted only for specified amounts.
For insurance contracts without direct participation features, the contractual service margin is not adjusted (remeasured) for changes in interest rates for the reasons set out in paragraphs BC228–BC231.
Accreting interest for a period at a current rate without also remeasuring the contractual service margin at the start of the period would create an internally inconsistent measurement of the contractual service margin.
To make the contractual service margin internally consistent, the Board decided that the adjustments for changes in estimates of future cash flows also need to be measured at the rate that applied on initial recognition.
This leads to a difference between the change in the fulfilment cash flows and the adjustment to the contractual service margin — the difference between the change in the future cash flows measured at a current rate and the change in the future cash flows measured at the rate that had applied on initial recognition.
That difference gives rise to a gain or loss that is included in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, depending on the accounting policy choice an entity makes for the presentation of insurance finance income or expenses.
The remeasurement of the contractual service margin reflects current rates and changes in the value of the consideration received.
Remeasuring the contractual service margin in this way is consistent with the view that the entity is earning a variable fee from the contract — the amount it deducts from its obligation to return the value of underlying items to the policyholder (see paragraphs BC238–BC247).
A consequence of this is that insurance revenue includes changes in the entity's share in the change in the fair value of the underlying items.
Insurance revenue for the period is therefore also based on that remeasured amount.
The Board decided this appropriately reflects the variable nature of the fee for such contracts.
BC276A For insurance contracts without direct participation features, differences arise between a change in the fulfilment cash flows measured using current discount rates, and the resulting adjustment to the contractual service margin measured using discount rates locked in at initial recognition (see paragraph BC275).
Others said such an amendment would be conceptually appropriate.
The fulfilment cash flows are a current risk-adjusted estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from a group of insurance contracts.
In contrast, the contractual service margin is the profit expected to arise from future service that an entity will provide for a group of insurance contracts.
The contractual service margin on initial recognition of a group is the difference between the estimated cash inflows and estimated cash outflows (adjusted for the effect of the time value of money, non-financial risk and financial risk).
The contractual service margin is not a future cash flow.
When changes in fulfilment cash flows relate to future service, the expected profit relating to that future service changes.
Accordingly, those changes in estimates adjust the contractual service margin.
An entity would measure profit inconsistently if it were to measure the effect of future cash flows on the contractual service margin at discount rates that differed depending on when such future cash flows become part of the expected cash flows.
The Board concluded that measuring the contractual service margin at the discount rates determined at the date of initial recognition (that is, locked-in discount rates) provides a faithful representation of the revenue earned as the entity provides services, reflecting the price set at the contract issue date for that service.
In contrast, measuring changes in the contractual service margin using current rates would result in arbitrary amounts relating to the effects of changes in discount rates being reflected in the insurance service result rather than in insurance finance income or expenses.
BC276E The Board disagreed with stakeholders who said that entities would have difficulty explaining to users of financial statements a gain or loss arising from the differences between a change in fulfilment cash flows and a change in the adjustment to the contractual service margin.
The Board observed that the gain or loss provides information about the cumulative amount of insurance finance income or expenses that had been previously recognised and should be reversed, or the amount that was not previously recognised and now is.
However, the contractual service margin component might be classified as non-monetary because it is similar to prepayments for goods and services.
The Board decided that it would be simpler to treat all components of the measurement of an insurance contract denominated in a single currency as either monetary or non-monetary.
This applies for both the fulfilment cash flows and the contractual service margin.
The Board's conclusion that the insurance contract is a monetary item does not change if an entity measures a group of insurance contracts using the simplified approach for the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage.
Recognition in profit or loss (paragraphs 44(e), 45(e) and B119–B119B of IFRS 17)
Insurance coverage is the defining service provided by insurance contracts.
The Board noted that an entity provides this service over the whole of the coverage period, and not just when it incurs a claim.
To achieve this, the contractual service margin for a group of insurance contracts remaining (before any allocation) at the end of the reporting period is allocated over the coverage provided in the current period and expected remaining future coverage, on the basis of coverage units, reflecting the expected duration and quantity of benefits provided by contracts in the group.
the contractual service margin should be allocated based on the pattern of expected cash flows or on the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk caused by the release of risk.
However, the Board decided the pattern of expected cash flows and the release of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk are not relevant factors in determining the satisfaction of the performance obligation of the entity.
They are already included in the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows and do not need to be considered in the allocation of the contractual service margin.
Hence, the Board concluded that coverage units better reflect the provision of insurance coverage.
the contractual service margin should be allocated before any adjustments made because of changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service.
However, the Board concluded that allocating the amount of the contractual service margin adjusted for the most up-to-date assumptions provides the most relevant information about the profit earned from service provided in the period and the profit to be earned in the future from future service.
BC280 The Board considered whether the allocation of the contractual service margin based on coverage units would result in profit being recognised too early for insurance contracts with fees determined based on the returns on underlying items.
The Board rejected the view that the allocation based on coverage units results in premature profit recognition.
The Board noted that the investment component of such contracts is accounted for as part of the insurance contract only when the cash flows from the investment component and from insurance and other services are highly interrelated and hence cannot be accounted for as distinct components.
The approach would have constrained the cumulative amount of the contractual service margin that the entity recognised in profit or loss to the amount to which the entity is reasonably assured to be entitled.
The Board concluded that should be a matter of judgement by an entity.
BC283 Consistent with the requirements in IFRS 15, the settlement of a liability is not considered to be a service provided by the entity.
Thus, the recognition period for the contractual service margin is the coverage period over which the entity provides the coverage promised in the insurance contract, rather than the period over which the liability is expected to be settled.
require an entity to identify coverage units for insurance contracts without direct participation features considering the quantity of benefits and expected period of investment-return service, if any, in addition to insurance coverage.
clarify that an entity is required to identify coverage units for insurance contracts with direct participation features considering the quantity of benefits and expected period of both insurance coverage and investment-related service.
require an entity to include investment activity costs in the fulfilment cash flows, to the extent that the entity performs those activities to
provide investment-return service to policyholders of insurance contracts without direct participation features (see paragraph B119B of IFRS 17); or
(iii) provide investment-related service to policyholders of insurance contracts with direct participation features.
define 'insurance contract services' as comprising insurance coverage, investment-return service and investment-related service.
expand the definitions of a liability for remaining coverage and a liability for incurred claims to reflect an entity's obligation to provide insurance contract services and any other obligations arising from insurance contracts.
BC283B The Board was persuaded that some insurance contracts without direct participation features provide an investment-return service (see paragraph BC283A(a)).
Recognising the contractual service margin considering both insurance coverage and an investment-return service will provide useful information to users of financial statements, particularly for contracts that have an insurance coverage period that differs from the period in which the policyholder benefits from an investment-return service.
BC283C The Board concluded that an investment-return service exists only if the contract includes an investment component or the policyholder has a right to withdraw an amount from the entity.
Further, those amounts must be expected to include an investment return that the entity generates by performing investment activity.
The Board concluded that if those conditions are not met, the policyholder has no right to benefit from investment returns.
In this context, a 'right to withdraw an amount from the entity' includes a policyholder's right to
receive a surrender value or refund of premiums on cancellation of a policy; or
transfer an amount to another insurance provider.
Entities might also conclude that an investment-return service exists in circumstances in which the Board would conclude otherwise (for example, when an entity provides only custodial services relating to an investment component).
On the other hand, specifying conditions creates the risk of an inappropriate outcome in some scenarios.
An entity is required to apply judgement, considering the facts and circumstances, to determine whether an insurance contract that meets the conditions provides an investment-return service.
BC283F Including an investment-return service in addition to insurance coverage in determining coverage units for insurance contracts without direct participation features adds subjectivity and complexity to that determination.
Insurance contract services are the only services that an entity considers when determining coverage units and hence the recognition of the contractual service margin in profit or loss.
Insurance revenue can be analysed as consisting of the amount of the contractual service margin allocated to the period, the release of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk in the period and the expenses the entity expected to incur in the period.
Some insurance contracts include a pre-coverage period, between the date the contract is recognised and the date the entity first provides insurance contract services.
In contracts with a pre-coverage period, an entity may be released from non-financial risk, or may incur expenses before the coverage period begins—in other words, before the entity starts providing insurance contract services.
The Board did not want to preclude an entity from recognising the related insurance revenue in that pre-coverage period.
The Board acknowledged that an entity may also incur investment activity costs to enhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders.
The Board also specified when investment activities enhance benefits from insurance coverage.
The Board noted that in determining whether investment activity costs enhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders, an entity needs to apply judgement in a similar manner to when an entity determines whether an investment-return service exists.
BC283J Some stakeholders said the Board should replace the requirements for the recognition of the contractual service margin in profit or loss with a less specific requirement based on all services provided by the contract.
Applying this suggestion, an entity would decide what services are provided by the contract, potentially including services other than insurance coverage or services related to investment returns.
The Board concluded that specifying that an entity recognises the contractual service margin by considering all services would result in more subjectivity and complexity than entities already face when determining the pattern of service provision.
Furthermore, the Board noted that the concerns leading to this suggestion were generally about services related to investment returns.
Thus, the amendment balances the need for relevant information about the way in which profit from the contract is earned and the need for comparable information, as well as the costs of applying the coverage units requirement.
BC285 After an entity recognises a loss for a group of onerous contracts, there may subsequently be favourable changes in the estimates of the fulfilment cash flows relating to future service.
The Board considered whether such changes should be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they reverse previously recognised losses or whether the changes should adjust, or rebuild, the contractual service margin.
However, some stakeholders stated that it would be counterintuitive to rebuild a contractual service margin for future profit from contracts that were considered loss-making overall.
Hence, the Board decided that some tracking of the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage would be needed.
Further, the Board concluded that the complexity added by requiring this tracking was outweighed by the benefits of the more faithful representation of performance that would be provided to users of financial statements if the effect of favourable changes were recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they reverse losses previously recognised in profit or loss.
The Board therefore decided to require an entity to make a systematic allocation of changes in the fulfilment cash flows for the liability for remaining coverage that could be regarded as affecting either the loss component or the rest of the liability.
Nevertheless, that initial measurement can be described as containing the components that build the measurement of the group of insurance contracts implicitly, as follows
an estimate of the future cash flows, made at initial recognition;
the effect of the time value of money and of financial risks, measured at initial recognition;
the effect of non-financial risk, measured at initial recognition; and
a contractual service margin, if any, measured at initial recognition.
BC290 Subsequently, the liability for remaining coverage is recognised over the coverage period on the basis of the passage of time unless the expected pattern of release from risk differs significantly from the passage of time, in which case it is recognised based on the expected timing of incurred claims and benefits.
The Board views the premium allocation approach as a simplification of those general requirements.
should accrete interest on the liability for remaining coverage only for groups of insurance contracts that have a significant financing component.
need to assess whether groups of insurance contracts are onerous only when facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts has become onerous.
The Board concluded that no other simplifications were needed for the measurement of the liability for incurred claims because it comprises only the fulfilment cash flows for settling the incurred claims and expenses, with no contractual service margin.
However, in considering how to disaggregate insurance finance income or expenses between profit or loss and other comprehensive income (see paragraphs BC42–BC44), the Board considered requiring the interest expense for the liability for incurred claims to be measured using either
the discount rate at initial recognition of the contract; or
the discount rate at the date the claims included in the liability for incurred claims occur.
The Board concluded that the premium allocation approach, which was developed as a simplification, should not burden entities by creating high costs and operational complexity.
The Board identified no reason to apply different requirements to reinsurance contracts from those applied to other insurance contracts an entity issues.
BC297 Although both an issuer of direct insurance contracts and a reinsurer of those contracts will measure their contractual rights and obligations on the same basis, in practice they will not necessarily arrive at the same amount.
Differences between the estimates for the reinsurance contract and the underlying contracts may arise because the issuer of the underlying insurance contracts and the reinsurer may base estimates on access to different information; they may also make different adjustments for diversification effects.
This is because an entity that holds a reinsurance contract does not normally have a right to reduce the amounts it owes to the underlying policyholder by amounts it expects to receive from the reinsurer.
The Board acknowledged that separate accounting for the reinsurance contracts and their underlying insurance contracts might create mismatches that some regard as purely accounting, for example on the timing of recognition (see paragraphs BC304–BC305), the measurement of the reinsurance contracts (see paragraphs BC310–BC312) and the recognition of profit (see paragraph BC313).
However, the Board concluded that accounting for a reinsurance contract held separately from the underlying insurance contracts gives a faithful representation of the entity's rights and obligations and the related income and expenses from both contracts.
The amount paid for reinsurance coverage by the entity can be viewed as payment for the following
That amount includes an adjustment for the risk that the reinsurer may dispute coverage or fail to satisfy its obligations under the reinsurance contract held.
a contractual service margin that makes the initial measurement of the reinsurance asset equal to the premium paid.
As a result, the cash flows used to measure the reinsurance contracts held would reflect the extent to which those cash flows depend on the cash flows of the contracts they cover.
groups of reinsurance contracts held are generally assets, rather than liabilities; and
entities holding reinsurance contracts generally pay a margin to the reinsurer as an implicit part of the premium, rather than making profits from the reinsurance contracts.
cash flows (see paragraphs BC307–BC309F); and
contractual service margin (see paragraphs BC310–BC315L).
BC304 Many reinsurance arrangements are designed to cover the claims incurred under underlying insurance contracts written during a specified period.
In these contracts the entity benefits from coverage — in case the underlying losses exceed the threshold — from the beginning of the group of reinsurance contracts held because such losses accumulate throughout the coverage period.
The Board concluded such an amendment was necessary for income to be recognised on a group of reinsurance contracts held at the same time that losses are recognised on initial recognition of onerous underlying insurance contracts.
A reinsurance contract held typically protects the entity from the effects of some defined losses on the underlying group of insurance contracts, but does not eliminate the entity's responsibility for fulfilling its obligations under those contracts.
It follows that the entity typically would not derecognise the related underlying insurance contracts upon entering into a reinsurance contract.
This is discussed in paragraphs BC308–BC309.
BC308 An entity holding reinsurance contracts faces the risk that the reinsurer may default, or may dispute whether a valid claim exists for an insured event.
Hence, estimates of the amounts and timing of cash flows are probability-weighted outcomes after calculating the effect of credit losses.
In the Board's view, differences in expected credit losses do not relate to future service. Accordingly, any changes in expected credit losses are economic events that the Board decided should be reflected as gains and losses in profit or loss when they occur.
BC309A Estimates of future cash flows included in the measurement of a group of reinsurance contracts held include future cash flows that relate to insurance contracts an entity expects to be covered by the reinsurance contracts held in the group.
Such cash flows include cash flows related to insurance contracts the entity expects to issue in the future if the entity has a substantive right to receive reinsurance coverage for those insurance contracts.
In contrast, if a reinsurance contract held provides an entity with neither substantive rights nor substantive obligations relating to insurance contracts it expects to issue, those insurance contracts would be outside the boundary of the reinsurance contract held.
The Board identified no reason for these requirements to be applied inconsistently — they should be applied both to insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held.
BC309D The Board noted that including all expected future cash flows in the measurement of the contractual service margin at initial recognition of the group of reinsurance contracts held reflects the conditions under which the entity agreed, under specified terms, to receive services from the reinsurer for future insurance contracts it expects to issue.
They said such a mismatch arises because expected future cash flows that relate to the reinsurance of those insurance contracts will be included in the measurement of the reinsurance contract held before those underlying insurance contracts are issued.
The Board disagreed that differences between the carrying amount of the reinsurance contract held and the underlying insurance contracts are accounting mismatches.
The carrying amount of a reinsurance contract held is nil before any cash flows occur or any service is received.
the timing of cash flows; and
interest accreted on the contractual service margin of the reinsurance contract held from an earlier period than, and at a different discount rate from, the interest accreted on the contractual service margin of the underlying insurance contracts, reflecting the different effects of the time value of money on the contractual service margin and fulfilment cash flows.
However, the Board concluded that the benefits of appropriately reflecting an entity's rights and obligations as the holder of a reinsurance contract outweigh those costs.
BC310 The amount paid by the entity to buy reinsurance contracts would typically exceed the expected present value of cash flows generated by the reinsurance contracts held, plus the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.
Thus, a debit contractual service margin, which represents the net expense of purchasing reinsurance, would typically be recognised on the initial recognition of a group of reinsurance contracts held.
The Board considered whether the contractual service margin of the group of reinsurance contracts held could be a credit if, as happens in rare cases, the amount paid by the entity is less than the expected present value of cash flows plus the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.
favourable pricing by the reinsurer; for example, as a result of diversification benefits that are not available to the entity.
The Board proposed this for symmetry with the model for the underlying group of insurance contracts and for consistency with the Board's conclusion that the contractual service margin for the underlying group of insurance contracts should not be negative.
The Board was persuaded by the view that the apparent gain at initial recognition represents a reduction in the cost of purchasing reinsurance, and that it would be appropriate for an entity to recognise that reduction in cost over the coverage period as services are received.
For such reinsurance contracts held, the Board concluded that entities should recognise the whole of the net expense at initial recognition, to be consistent with the treatment of the net expense of purchasing reinsurance before an insured event has occurred.
The Board acknowledged that this approach does not treat the coverage period of the reinsurance contract consistently with the view that for some insurance contracts the insured event is the discovery of a loss during the term of the contract, if that loss arises from an event that had occurred before the inception of the contract.
However, the Board concluded that consistency of the treatment of the net expense across all reinsurance contracts held would result in more relevant information.
Thereafter, unearned profit from the group of underlying contracts would be offset by an equal and opposite expense for the reinsurance premium.
However, in the Board's view, measuring the group of reinsurance contracts held on the basis of the premium the entity receives for the underlying contracts when that premium does not directly affect the cash flows arising from the group of reinsurance contracts held would be contrary to viewing the group of reinsurance contracts held and the underlying contracts as separate contracts.
Such a measurement approach would also not reflect the economics of the group of reinsurance contracts the entity holds — that the expense of purchasing the group of reinsurance contracts (that should be recognised over the coverage period) equals the whole of the consideration paid for the group of reinsurance contracts.
Accordingly, the Board placed no limit on the amount of the adjustment to the contractual service margin for the group of reinsurance contracts held, subject to the amount of premium paid to the reinsurer.
BC315 The Board considered the situation that arises when the underlying group of insurance contracts becomes onerous after initial recognition because of adverse changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows relating to future service.
In such a situation, the entity recognises a loss on the group of underlying insurance contracts.
The Board concluded that corresponding changes in cash inflows from a group of reinsurance contracts held should not adjust the contractual service margin of the group of reinsurance contracts held, with the result that the entity recognises no net effect of the loss and gain in the profit or loss for the period.
This means that, to the extent that the change in the fulfilment cash flows of the group of underlying contracts is matched with a change in fulfilment cash flows on the group of reinsurance contracts held, there is no net effect on profit or loss.
An entity determines the income on the reinsurance contract held (ie the amount of loss recovered) by multiplying
the percentage of claims on underlying insurance contracts the entity expects to recover from the reinsurance contracts held.
BC315B As a practical assumption, the amendment treats
a loss recognised on an underlying insurance contract as the early recognition of a portion of expected claims; and
a loss recovery recognised on the reinsurance contract held as the early recognition of a portion of expected claim recoveries.
The Board concluded it would not be appropriate for an entity to recognise a recovery of loss when the entity does not hold a reinsurance contract.
BC315D As a consequence of the amendment described in paragraph BC315A, the Board also
That income would reflect the entity's right to recover those losses.
BC315F The Board was persuaded that such an amendment was justified because
the amendment provides users of financial statements with useful information about expected loss recoveries on reinsurance contracts held that complements the information about expected losses on underlying insurance contracts.
The information provided about onerous underlying contracts is unchanged.
On balance, the Board concluded that the added complexity is justified given the strong stakeholder support for the information that will result from entities applying the amendment.
The Board also noted that, applying the amendment, the loss-recovery component of a reinsurance contract held is treated similarly to the loss component of insurance contracts issued.
That similarity will help entities to understand how to apply the amendment, reducing the complexity caused.
BC315H An entity might group together onerous insurance contracts covered by a reinsurance contract held and onerous insurance contracts not covered by a reinsurance contract held.
To apply the amendment described in paragraph BC315A in that circumstance, an entity needs to determine amounts at a level that is lower than the level of the group of insurance contracts.
Accordingly, the Board specified that, in that circumstance, an entity applies a systematic and rational method of allocation to determine the portion of losses on a group of insurance contracts that relates to underlying insurance contracts covered by a reinsurance contract held.
For such contracts, an entity can easily identify the portion of losses on underlying insurance contracts that the entity has a right to recover.
For other reinsurance contracts held, the Board was concerned that entities would have difficulty identifying that portion and thus may need to make arbitrary allocations.
However, in the light of feedback on the Exposure Draft, the Board concluded that it should not impose that limitation.
Respondents to the Exposure Draft reported that if the Board had limited the amendment in that way, the amendment would apply to few reinsurance contracts held in practice.
Further, respondents said that an entity could identify the portion of losses the entity has a right to recover for any reinsurance contract held in a non-arbitrary way based on the expected claim recovery cash flows included in the measurement of the reinsurance contract held.
The entity could determine the portion of losses on the onerous contracts that the entity has a right to recover by comparing
total expected claims for all underlying insurance contracts.
The Board disagreed with this view because an entity has a right to recover claims from the reinsurance contract held regardless of whether claim recoveries are expected to be higher or lower than the premiums the entity pays to the reinsurer.
BC315L The Board also considered an alternative suggestion to require a loss on a group of insurance contracts to be treated as a negative contractual service margin to the extent that the contracts in the group are covered by a reinsurance contract held on a proportionate basis.
The Board disagreed with this suggestion because it is inconsistent with the Board's objective to recognise losses on insurance contracts when expected.
An obligation is extinguished when it has expired or has been discharged or cancelled.
However, in some cases, an entity may modify the terms of an existing contract in a way that would have significantly changed the accounting of the contract if the new terms had always existed.
In some cases, insurance contract modifications will result in derecognising the insurance contract.
The consideration for the new contract (ie the implicit premium) is deemed to be the price the entity would have charged the policyholder had it entered into a contract with equivalent terms at the date of the modification.
the adjustment to the contractual service margin of the group to which the existing contract belonged on derecognition of the existing contract; and
the contractual service margin for the new contract.
Such an approach measures the modified contract consistently with the measurement of other insurance contract liabilities.
BC319 The Board considered whether the contractual service margin of the group to which the existing contract belonged should be adjusted for the gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the existing contract and recognition of the modified contract (paragraph BC317(a)).
The alternative (not adjusting the contractual service margin) would result in a gain or loss in profit or loss.
Hence, the Board decided that the contractual service margin of the group from which the existing contract has been derecognised should be adjusted.
An insurance contract is extinguished when the obligation specified in the insurance contract expires or is discharged or cancelled.
It also considered concerns that an entity might be unable to derecognise those liabilities.
Some argued that, in some cases, the delayed derecognition would result in unreasonable and unduly burdensome accounting.
In the Board's view, ignoring contractual obligations that remain in existence and that can generate valid claims would not give a faithful representation of an entity's financial position.
This means that the entity determines the contractual service margin, in accordance with the general requirements of IFRS 17, in a way that reflects the consideration paid for the contracts.
In those cases, the amount by which the group is onerous is recognised
immediately as an expense in profit or loss for a transfer of insurance contracts, in the same way as for insurance contracts that the entity issues.
as an adjustment to the initial measurement of goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase, for a business combination.
Although this requires a new measurement exception to the principle of fair value measurement in IFRS 3, similar exceptions are contained in that Standard for other cases in which liabilities, such as pension liabilities, are measured on a current value basis that is not fair value.
the insurance contracts are in a liability position at the date of the transfer or business combination and the fulfilment cash flows are higher than the fair value; or
the insurance contracts are in an asset position at the date of the transfer or business combination and the fulfilment cash flows are lower than the fair value.
For transfers of insurance contracts, the most likely cause of the difference is that the fair value would include the risk of non-performance by the entity.
The Board concluded that, for contracts in a liability position acquired in a transfer, the immediate recognition of a loss faithfully represents the entity's assumption of an obligation it expects to fulfil but for which it received a lower price because of the risk that it might not be able to fulfil the obligation.
Consequently, the recognition of that difference as an adjustment to the gain on the business combination or goodwill is consistent with the accounting for similar effects in a business combination.
Classification as an insurance contract
Such differences reflect changes in facts and circumstances at the acquisition date compared to facts and circumstances at the date the acquiree recognised the contracts.
Such differences depict the economics of the acquisition, are not unique to insurance contracts and are not unusual when applying IFRS Standards.
Contracts acquired in their settlement period
The Board concluded that an entity that acquires a contract should, at the acquisition date, apply the requirements for identifying whether a contract has an insured event and meets the definition of an insurance contract — just as an entity that issues a contract applies the requirements at the issue date.
BC327F An acquirer identifies assets and liabilities acquired based on the contractual terms, rights and obligations and economic conditions at the acquisition date, including the consideration to which the acquirer agreed at that date.
The Board noted that for a contract to meet the definition of an insurance contract from the perspective of the acquirer at the acquisition date, the acquirer must compensate the policyholder for the adverse effect of an uncertain future event (that is, the acquirer must provide insurance coverage).
In some circumstances, all claim amounts are known at the acquisition date but remain unpaid.
The Board also observed that for contracts that meet the definition of an insurance contract at the acquisition date, an entity would need to consider whether any amounts payable to the policyholder meet the definition of an investment component (and are therefore excluded from insurance revenue).
future insurance contracts that are renewals of insurance contracts recognised at that date; and
As a result, the contractual service margin for a group of insurance contracts recognised after the acquisition date will appropriately reflect the rights relating to that future group which the entity paid for as part of the consideration for the acquisition.
Otherwise, broader rights to obtain future contracts from intangible assets such as customer relationships, unconnected to any previously paid insurance acquisition cash flows, could be included in the assets for insurance acquisition cash flows and therefore subsequently included in the contractual service margin of future groups of insurance contracts.
In contrast, the Board decided that such reference is unnecessary to determine the rights described in paragraph BC327H(a)—these rights relate only to renewals, so they are sufficiently constrained.
This requirement is consistent with the measurement of a group of insurance contracts as a package of cash inflows and cash outflows.
The Board considered and rejected
other approaches to the presentation of insurance revenue, including
other approaches to the presentation of insurance finance income and expenses
include all insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss; and
use the current period book yield for all contracts.
The amendment also applies to portfolios of reinsurance contracts held.
BC330B The presentation requirement prior to the amendment was consistent with the requirements for recognising and measuring groups of insurance contracts.
These entities said that an amendment to require an entity to present insurance contracts at a portfolio level would provide significant operational relief.
The Board rejected that suggestion because such presentation would risk an unacceptable loss of useful information for users of financial statements.
Applying IFRS 4, some entities presented separately in the statement of financial position different amounts arising from an insurance contract, as if those different amounts were separate assets or liabilities.
For example, some entities presented an insurance contract liability and line items labelled as premiums receivable, claims payable and deferred acquisition costs.
Entities differed in what line items they presented and in the definitions of those line items.
For example, some entities presented amounts that were not yet billed as premiums receivable whereas other entities presented only billed amounts that remain outstanding.
Some stakeholders said they would like to continue further disaggregation because they view such disaggregated line items as providing meaningful information to users of financial statements.
The Board disagreed with suggestions to permit an entity to continue such disaggregation because it could result in the presentation of amounts that are not separable assets or liabilities.
For example, premiums receivable for future insurance coverage is not a gross asset separable from the related liability for the future insurance coverage.
Investment components may be more significant in some contracts than in others.
For example, significant investment components exist in many long-term life insurance contracts and in some large long-term or bespoke non-life insurance or reinsurance contracts.
Some argued that any attempt to distinguish between investment components that have not been separated and the premium charged for insurance and other services would be arbitrary and complex to apply.
The summarised-margin approach would have been operationally less complex than any presentation that provides a gross performance measure in profit or loss.
This is because the summarised-margin approach would not have distinguished between investment components and premiums for services provided.
BC333 Nonetheless, the summarised-margin approach would have been a significant change from previous practice because it would have precluded presenting revenue-type line items in profit or loss.
BC334 Accordingly, the Board rejected the summarised-margin approach.
At the same time, the entity recognises expenses which must be reconciled to the incurred claims (see paragraphs BC343–BC344).
The Board rejected this approach because the premiums, claims and expenses presented in profit or loss are not measured by applying commonly understood notions of revenue and expenses.
In particular, the revenue is recognised before the entity has performed a service and the claims and expenses are recognised before they have been incurred.
BC337 Many entities that issue long-duration insurance contracts previously applied a premiums-due approach in profit or loss.
A premiums-due approach would have
provided information about the additional premiums for services to which the entity has an unconditional right; and
provided a measure of growth and a denominator for claims and expenses ratios that is objective, sufficient for that purpose and simpler to provide than insurance revenue.
In particular, in a premiums-due approach
revenue would typically be recognised before the entity has performed the corresponding service.
the amounts presented as revenue and claims, benefits and expenses would vary depending on when a contract requires payment of the premium.
For example, if a premium is due at the start of the contract, then all revenue and expenses are presented in the period the contract is issued.
The Board decided that reporting claims and expenses when incurred would provide useful information to users of financial statements, as discussed in paragraphs BC343–BC344.
As noted in paragraph BC344, when revenue is measured using a premium approach, the incurred claims must be reconciled to the amount of expenses presented in the period and a balancing figure must be presented in profit or loss.
Feedback from users of financial statements suggested that this balancing figure is difficult for users to interpret when analysing insurers' performance in the period.
BC339 Although the Board rejected a premiums-due approach for the reasons given above, it noted that some of the information provided by a premiums-due approach could be useful.
This would prevent accounting mismatches with finance income from assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, and could also reduce the complexity inherent in disaggregating changes in the liability.
However, many stakeholders expressed concern that gains and losses from underwriting and investing activities would be obscured by more volatile gains and losses arising from changes in the current discount rate applied to the cash flows in insurance contracts.
In addition, many preparers of financial statements expressed concern that they would be forced to measure their financial assets at fair value through profit or loss to avoid accounting mismatches.
Accordingly, these preparers say that the volatility in profit or loss that would result from a current value measurement of insurance contracts would impair the faithful representation of their financial performance and users of financial statements would face difficulties in comparing insurers with entities that have no significant insurance contracts.
The Board was not persuaded that entities that issue insurance contracts would be disadvantaged if insurance contracts were to be measured at current value.
However, the Board was persuaded that users of financial statements may find that, for some contracts, the presentation of insurance finance income or expenses based on a systematic allocation in profit or loss would be more useful than the presentation of total insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss.
Such presentation would provide disaggregated information about the effects of changes in insurance contract assets and liabilities in profit or loss.
BC342 The Board also considered requiring a current period book yield for all insurance contracts.
The current period book yield is the change in the carrying amount of assets regarded as backing the insurance contracts that is recognised in profit or loss for the period.
The Board rejected this approach, except as discussed in paragraph BC48, because recognising insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss measured using a discount rate that has no relationship to the rate that is used to measure the group of insurance contracts does not provide useful information.
In addition, it may be difficult in some circumstances to identify the assets that are held by the entities to back insurance contract liabilities.
Otherwise, changes in underlying items could adjust the contractual service margin of insurance contracts without direct participation features.
The Board considered a view that the effects of changes in cash flows resulting from the participation in underlying items that are not solely financial in nature (for example, insurance contracts) should be presented within the insurance service result, instead of within insurance finance income or expenses.
The Board disagreed with this view because the requirement to reflect changes from participation in underlying items in insurance finance income or expenses appropriately depicts the nature of the participation—as an investment.
The Board concluded that policyholder participation in underlying items, including underlying items that are not solely financial in nature such as insurance contracts, should have no effect on the depiction of the entity's insurance service result.
Further, splitting the effect of changes in cash flows resulting from the participation in underlying items that are not solely financial in nature into an amount that should be included in the insurance service result and an amount that should be included in insurance finance income or expenses would be complex and could disrupt implementation for some entities.
That feedback led to no amendment because the Board noted that an entity can avoid such mismatches by not applying the option.
BC343 Reporting claims and expenses (other than insurance acquisition expenses) when incurred is consistent with the reporting of expenses for other types of contracts and, the Board decided, provides useful information to users of financial statements.
BC344 Reporting claims and expenses in this way is only possible when insurance revenue is measured using changes in the liability for remaining coverage as a measure of progress towards satisfying an obligation.
When insurance revenue is measured in any other way, the incurred claims must be reconciled to the amount of expenses that is presented in the period.
This is because both insurance revenue and incurred claims and benefits are measures of changes in the liability for the group of insurance contracts relating to coverage in the period.
Rather than incorporating those criteria in IFRS 17, the Board decided that it was simpler to prohibit an entity from offsetting reinsurance contract assets held against related insurance contract liabilities.
The economic effect of such ceding commissions is equivalent to the effect of charging a lower premium with no ceding commission.
The disclosure objective is supplemented with some specific disclosure requirements designed to help the entity satisfy this objective.
By specifying the objective of the disclosures, the Board aims to ensure that entities provide the information that is most relevant for their circumstances and to emphasise the importance of communication to users of financial statements rather than compliance with detailed and prescriptive disclosure requirements.
the nature and extent of risks that arise from insurance contracts, including
The Board therefore decided that entities should disclose the following items
the risk adjustment for non-financial risk (see paragraphs BC213–BC217);
(iii) discount rates (see paragraphs BC193–BC205); and
(iv) investment components (see paragraphs BC33–BC34A).
the liability for remaining coverage, excluding the amounts in (b) below.
For liabilities measured using the premium allocation approach, this is the unearned premium, less any unamortised insurance acquisition cash flows.
the liability for incurred claims.
Those changes include insurance service expenses incurred in the period, the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk and the amount of the contractual service margin allocated to the period.
BC355 The Board concluded that a reconciliation showing sources of profit would provide useful information for users of financial statements.
Furthermore, in the Board's view, information about changes in the components used in the measurement of insurance contracts will be important in the light of the Board's decision to adjust the contractual service margin for the effects of changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows relating to future service (see paragraphs 44(c) and 45(c) of IFRS 17).
The Board decided to require both reconciliations because feedback received from stakeholders generally indicated that the information required in each reconciliation will be useful.
Such information differs from revenue.
A measure of insurance revenue by itself provides only part of the information users of financial statements seek, and is not intended to measure an entity's insurance contracts business growth or shrinkage.
In particular, many users of financial statements find information about the amount, and profitability, of new business written in each period to be important when assessing an entity's future prospects.
BC359 As noted in paragraphs BC28–BC29, the purpose of insurance revenue is to measure the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for services provided in the period.
This consideration may differ from premiums from new contracts generated or cash collected.
The Board noted, therefore, that the use of accruals-based accounting for any contract initiated in advance of services provided (ie any contract for which the performance obligation is not satisfied in the period in which the contract is written) can result in revenue increasing even if the volume of new contracts issued decreased.
The Board noted that this effect is not unique to insurance contracts and sought to identify other ways to provide useful information regarding an entity's growth.
In particular, information about the contractual service margin, and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk initially recognised in the period, would provide useful information about the profitability of new contracts issued in the period.
the estimates of the present value of future cash flows;
The separate disclosure of the estimates of the present value of future cash inflows, including any investment components
The Board agreed this information would be useful to users of financial statements.
the total amount of its insurance finance income or expenses in each period;
the basis for any disaggregation of the total between amounts recognised in profit or loss and other comprehensive income; and
the relationship between insurance finance income or expenses and investment income on the related assets the entity holds.
Such changes may be recognised either in profit or loss, or by adjusting the contractual service margin.
Recognising the lack of comparability that this accounting policy choice creates, the Board decided to require an entity that chooses to recognise such changes in profit or loss to disclose the effect of that choice on the adjustment to the contractual service margin in the current period.
BC366 For contracts with direct participation features, an entity choosing to disaggregate insurance finance income or expenses between profit or loss and other comprehensive income might change the basis on which it determines the amounts to be included in profit or loss from a systematic allocation to the current period book yield (see paragraph BC48), or vice versa.
A change of basis is required if the entity becomes eligible, or ceases to be eligible, to apply the current period book yield because it starts to hold, or ceases to hold, the underlying items for a group of insurance contracts.
The Board requires the specified method to prevent an entity from including or excluding gains and losses permanently in profit or loss simply by choosing to buy or sell underlying items.
The Board also decided to require entities to disclose, in the period the change in basis occurs
the reason why the entity changed the basis of disaggregation;
the carrying amount of the groups of insurance contracts to which the change applied.
That amendment extends the period for which an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows exists, and therefore increases the total amount of such assets at the end of each reporting period.
An entity is also required to provide quantitative disclosure, in appropriate time bands, of the expected inclusion of insurance acquisition cash flows recognised as an asset in the measurement of the group of insurance contracts to which they are allocated (see paragraph 105A of IFRS 17).
That amendment adds complexity and judgement to the determination of the quantity of benefits provided by an insurance contract for the purpose of recognising the contractual service margin in profit or loss.
Accordingly, the Board decided to require an entity to disclose
quantitative information, in appropriate time bands, about when the entity expects to recognise in profit or loss the contractual service margin remaining at the end of the reporting period (instead of permitting an entity to provide only qualitative information); and
the approach used to assess the relative weighting of the benefits from insurance coverage and either investment-return service or investment-related service.
Reconciliation of premium receipts to insurance revenue
BC367 The Board originally proposed that an entity reconcile the insurance revenue to the premium receipts in each period because it wanted entities to explain how insurance revenue differs from previously familiar metrics.
Hence, a separate reconciliation, while permissible, is not required.
Many users of financial statements indicated a desire for additional disclosures that would help them to understand and analyse those effects; in particular
information about how much regulatory capital an entity needs to hold for the new contracts written in the period, and when that capital will cease to be required; and
information about the amount of equity generated in a reporting period that is not needed to service the regulatory capital requirements.
That amount is sometimes referred to as 'free cash flow'.
the entity's profitability, ongoing capital needs and, thus, financial flexibility;
an entity's capacity to write new business in future periods, because the excess over regulatory capital held is available to support future new business; and
improved understanding of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows during the reporting period.
Such disclosures might be useful for all entities operating in a regulated environment.
The Board acknowledged a choice of transition methods results in a lack of comparability of transition amounts but concluded it was appropriate for the following reasons.
The objective of the modified retrospective approach is to achieve the closest outcome to a retrospective application of the Standard.
The Board noted that the similarity between a modified retrospective approach and a full retrospective application would depend on the amount of reasonable and supportable information available to an entity.
If an entity has relatively little reasonable and supportable information available and, therefore, would need to use many of the permitted modifications, the cost of the modified retrospective approach might exceed the benefits.
BC373A When the Board considered feedback from entities implementing IFRS 17, the Board also considered feedback from users of financial statements that the optionality in the transition requirements reduces comparability between entities — in particular, the option to apply the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach.
The Board concluded that the choices provided are appropriate, for the reasons set out in paragraph BC373.
The Board therefore decided not to reduce the options available in the transition requirements, because doing so would be likely to cause undue disruption to implementation already under way.
The Board noted the reduced comparability that the transition options cause has no effect on the current value measurement of the fulfilment cash flows.
Retrospective application (paragraphs C3–C5B of IFRS 17)
The requirement to recognise any resulting net differences in equity means that no adjustment is made to the carrying amount of goodwill from any previous business combinations.
a direct measurement, which is based on estimates of the present value of future cash flows and an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and
a contractual service margin, which is measured on initial recognition of the group of insurance contracts, then adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates relating to future service and adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates relating to future services and a financing component and recognised in profit or loss over the coverage period.
That measurement reflects only circumstances at the measurement date.
These amounts reflect a revision of estimates for all periods after the initial recognition of the group of insurance contracts.
the estimates of cash flows at the date of initial recognition;
the risk adjustment for non-financial risk at the date of initial recognition;
the changes in estimates that would have been recognised in profit or loss for each accounting period because they did not relate to future service, and the extent to which changes in the fulfilment cash flows would have been allocated to the loss component;
the discount rates at the date of initial recognition; and
the effect of changes in discount rates on estimates of future cash flows for contracts for which changes in financial assumptions have a substantial effect on the amounts paid to policyholders.
Modified retrospective approach (paragraphs C6–C19A of IFRS 17)
BC379 Although many entities may not have sufficient information for retrospective application of IFRS 17, the Board was told that, in many cases, entities may have much of the information needed, and that some entities may face only a small number of limitations on retrospective application.
In such situations, the Board concluded that more comparable information about insurance contracts could result if an entity were permitted to modify retrospective application only when needed because it lacked information to apply a fully retrospective approach.
Furthermore, the Board concluded that an entity should
use the minimum modifications necessary for achieving the closest outcome to retrospective application that is possible using reasonable and supportable information; and
Those modifications are permitted only to the extent necessary because an entity does not have reasonable and supportable information to apply the retrospective approach.
simplify the information necessary for an entity to make assessments about insurance contracts or groups of insurance contracts that would be made at the date of inception or initial recognition (see paragraphs BC381–BC382B).
simplify how an entity determines amounts related to the contractual service margin (see paragraphs BC383–BC383B).
simplify how an entity determines the information necessary to determine insurance revenue (see paragraphs BC383–BC383B).
permit an entity to determine insurance finance income and expenses included in profit or loss using the discount rates at the transition date if an entity chooses to disaggregate insurance finance income or expenses into an amount included in profit or loss and an amount included in other comprehensive income.
In addition, the modification provides an expedient for determining the amount of the accumulated balance in equity relating to insurance finance income and expenses (see paragraphs BC384–BC384B).
maximise the use of reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort that would have been used to apply a fully retrospective approach.
use reasonable and supportable information to apply the modifications.
with regards to the suggestion in paragraph BC380A(a), permitting an entity to ignore reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort that the entity would have used to apply a fully retrospective approach would be contrary to the objective of the modified retrospective approach.
The objective is to achieve the closest outcome to retrospective application possible using reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort.
The suggestion would also reduce comparability between contracts issued before and after the transition date.
In the Board's view, applying a fair value approach would result in more useful information for users of financial statements than would applying a modified retrospective approach without the reasonable and supportable information necessary to do so.
The Board expects that entities will often need to make estimates when applying a specified modification in the modified retrospective approach.
The appropriateness of a method depends on facts and circumstances.
Assessments made at inception or initial recognition of insurance contracts (paragraphs C9–C10 of IFRS 17)
whether a contract is eligible for the variable fee approach;
how to group contracts; and
how to determine the effect of discretion on estimated cash flows for contracts subject to the general model.
Such assessments might be impossible without the use of hindsight (ie making an assumption of what an entity would have expected in the past).
The need for hindsight could be avoided if the assessments were made at the transition date instead of at the date of inception or initial recognition of the contract.
However, the Board noted that assessing contracts only at the transition date could impose grouping for entities that is significantly different from an assessment as at the date of the inception or initial recognition of the contract.
at the date of inception or initial recognition of a contract, if such assessments could be made based on reasonable and supportable evidence for what the entity would have determined given the terms of the contract and the market conditions at that time; or
Those reliefs permit an entity applying the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach to classify as a liability for incurred claims a liability for the settlement of claims when
the acquisition date was before the transition date.
Determining amounts relating to the contractual service margin and insurance revenue (paragraphs C11–C17 of IFRS 17)
Accordingly, the Board decided that it would specify modifications that could be used for making those estimates.
avoid the need for entities to measure the changes in estimates that would have been recognised in profit or loss because they did not relate to future service, or to assess the extent to which such changes in estimates had been reversed as claims were incurred;
provide an objective way for entities to estimate what the risk adjustment for non-financial risk would have been at the date of initial recognition;
provide a way for entities to estimate the discount rates at the date of initial recognition; and
provide guidance on how an entity should determine how much of the estimated contractual service margin on initial recognition should remain at the date of transition.
The Board disagreed with this suggestion, because if such modifications were permitted
an entity could use modifications that would result in an outcome that the Board would consider insufficiently close to retrospective application; and
each entity could use different modifications, reducing comparability and increasing complexity for users of financial statements.
An entity can determine the contractual service margin in this more direct way because of the extent to which the contractual service margin is remeasured for insurance contracts with direct participation features.
Determining insurance finance income and expenses (paragraphs C18 and C19 of IFRS 17)
Accordingly, the Board decided to provide modifications that would enable an entity to determine those amounts at the transition date.
These entities suggested that for all insurance contracts (insurance contracts with and without direct participation features), an entity should be required to
BC384B The Board considered but rejected the suggestions in paragraph BC384A because
both suggested amendments involve significant subjectivity in determining which assets relate to insurance contracts.
The Board noted that the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income relating to financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income includes amounts that relate to expected credit losses.
Hence, setting the cumulative amount to nil on transition would affect the accounting for expected credit losses in future periods.
The Board concluded that using that historical discount rate could result in a significant loss of useful information, because of the subjectivity in determining which assets relate to insurance contracts and because comparability for insurance contracts would be reduced between entities that hold different assets.
Fair value approach (paragraphs C20–C24B of IFRS 17)
The Board also decided to allow the use of the fair value approach whenever retrospective application is impracticable (see paragraph BC373).
The Board decided to clarify that in determining fair value of a group of insurance contracts, an entity should not apply the concept of a deposit floor (see paragraphs BC165–BC166).
determining the discount rates and the effect of changes in discount rates necessary to determine insurance finance income and expenses.
Comparative information (paragraphs C25–C28 of IFRS 17)
Contracts derecognised before the transition date
BC390 The Board decided that it would not provide a simplification for contracts that have been derecognised before the transition date.
The Board noted that reflecting the effect of contracts derecognised before the transition date on the remaining contractual service margin was necessary to provide a faithful representation of the remaining profit of the group of insurance contracts.
Furthermore, although entities may have difficulty obtaining details of cash flows for all contracts that have been derecognised, the Board concluded that an entity would be able to make estimates and extrapolations using reasonable and supportable information to enable the effect of derecognised contracts to be determined.
Finally, the Board observed that when an entity is not able to make such estimates and extrapolations, the fair value approach would be available.
Level of aggregation (paragraphs C9(a) and C10 of IFRS 17)
In addition, entities are allowed to accrete and adjust the resulting contractual service margin after transition using the discount rates at the transition date.
Although this results in a different accumulated balance in equity compared with the amount that would result from a full retrospective approach, and hence different insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss in the future, the Board concluded that users of financial statements could be alerted to these differences through disclosures.
when the entity has the information available to apply a fully retrospective approach would have the effect that the entity would not be applying a fully retrospective approach; and
when the entity has reasonable and supportable information to apply that requirement in the modified retrospective approach would be inconsistent with the objective of the modified retrospective approach.
However, an entity applying this option is required to document its risk management objective and the strategy for mitigating the risk before doing so.
Consistent with the transition requirements for hedge accounting in IFRS 9, the Board concluded that retrospective application of the risk mitigation treatment would give rise to the risk of hindsight.
In particular, the Board was concerned that documentation after the event could enable entities to choose the risk mitigation relationships to which it would apply this option, particularly because the application of this approach is optional.
the entity chooses to apply the risk mitigation option to the group prospectively from the transition date; and
before the transition date, the entity had been using derivatives, reinsurance contracts held or non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss to mitigate financial risk arising from the group of insurance contracts.
BC393B The amendments described in paragraph BC393A respond to concerns that prohibiting retrospective application of the risk mitigation option reduces comparability between risk mitigation activities that took place before the date of initial application and those that take place after that date.
Most stakeholders agreed with the Board that the amendments described in paragraph BC393A resolve these concerns.
The Board observed that if an entity were permitted to apply the option retrospectively, it could decide the extent to which it reflects risk mitigation activities in the contractual service margin based on known accounting outcomes.
The Board therefore reaffirmed its decision to prohibit retrospective application of the option because of the risk of the use of hindsight.
These stakeholders thought such an amendment would avoid the risk of hindsight.
The Board noted that an 'all or nothing' approach would require
an entity to retrospectively determine the effect of applying the risk mitigation option for all relationships described in (b) at each reporting date between initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts and the transition date.
The approach described in paragraph BC393D would not involve the risk of hindsight.
However, the Board concluded that applying that approach would be impracticable in almost all cases.
Meeting the conditions necessary for an 'all or nothing' approach would be a high hurdle that entities would overcome in only a narrow set of circumstances.
Redesignation of financial assets (paragraphs C29–C33 of IFRS 17)
Even though accounting mismatches do not determine the availability of this classification option, the Board noted that in practice entities may consider accounting mismatches when deciding whether to apply the option.
However, the Board acknowledged that there is a relationship between how entities manage their financial assets and their insurance contract liabilities.
Such changes may create or eliminate accounting mismatches between the contracts and financial liabilities an entity might consider to be related to the contracts.
will be required to disclose information about the changes in the classification and measurement of contracts as a result of applying these amendments in addition to any disclosures required by other IFRS Standards; and
However, some may not have.
Accordingly, the Board decided to require that an entity provides disclosures that enable users of financial statements to identify the effect of groups of insurance contracts measured at the transition date applying the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach on the contractual service margin and revenue in subsequent periods.
Furthermore, the Board decided that entities should explain how they determined the measurement of insurance contracts that existed at the transition date for all periods in which these disclosures are required, for users of financial statements to understand the nature and significance of the methods used and judgements applied.
Disclosure of the amount of adjustment for each financial statement line item affected (paragraph 28(f) of IAS 8)
Effective date (paragraphs C1 and C2 of IFRS 17)
However, in the case of major Standards, such as IFRS 17, that have a pervasive effect on entities, the Board has allowed longer implementation periods to allow entities time to resolve the operational challenges in implementing those Standards.
The Board decided that the possible effects of regulatory capital requirements should not delay the implementation of a Standard intended to provide transparency about an entity's financial position.
undue delay in the effective date of the Standard may increase workload and costs, particularly for entities that are advanced in their implementation projects.
The Board was careful to propose only targeted amendments and not to reopen fundamental aspects of the Standard.
They commented on uncertainties and delays in jurisdictional endorsement and adoption processes and the consequential uncertainty about the effective dates that might be set in some jurisdictions.
However, the Board acknowledged that considering amendments to the Standard before its effective date inevitably caused some disruption to those processes.
The deferral should thereby help to improve the quality of the initial application of the Standard.
Early application (paragraphs C1 and C2 of IFRS 17)
Revised the requirements on combining contracts so that insurance contracts should be combined only when a set of insurance contracts with the same or a related counterparty may achieve, or is designed to achieve, an overall commercial effect and combining those contracts is necessary to report the substance of those contracts.
Revised the requirements to require disaggregation of a portfolio of insurance contracts at initial recognition into groups of insurance contracts that are onerous, profitable with no significant possibility of becoming onerous and other profitable contracts, with a narrow exemption for the effects of law or regulatory constraints on pricing.
Groups cannot contain contracts that are written more than one year apart.
A portfolio of insurance contracts is defined as insurance contracts subject to similar risks and managed together.
Clarified the guidance when there is no, or little, observable market data.
Clarified the principle for the recognition pattern of the contractual service margin by providing guidance that, for contracts other than investment contracts with discretionary participation features, an entity should recognise the contractual service margin in profit or loss on the basis of coverage units.
Revised the requirements so that favourable changes in estimates that arise after losses were previously recognised in profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss, to the extent that they reverse previously recognised losses.
Clarified what adjusts the contractual service margin.
For example, changes in discretionary cash flows, as specified by the entity, are regarded as relating to future service.
Introduced an option for an entity not to adjust the contractual service margin for changes in fulfilment cash flows or the entity's share of underlying items for which an entity uses derivatives to mitigate their financial risk in specified circumstances.
Revised the recognition of revenue over the coverage period to be according to the passage of time or, when the expected pattern of release of risk differs significantly from the passage of time, the expected timing of incurred insurance service expenses.
Revised to require an entity to determine the insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss for the liability for incurred claims using the discount rates determined at the date the liability for incurred claims is recognised.
This occurs when the entity applies the premium allocation approach to contracts for which the entity discounts the liability for incurred claims and chooses to present the effect of changes in discount rates in other comprehensive income.
Revised to require an entity that holds a group of reinsurance contracts to recognise immediately in profit or loss any changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows that arise from changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows for a group of underlying insurance contracts that are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Specified that if the entity disaggregates insurance finance income or expenses into an amount recognised in profit or loss and an amount recognised in other comprehensive income
in most circumstances, the amount included in profit or loss is determined by a systematic allocation of the total expected insurance finance income or expenses over the duration of the group of insurance contracts.
when the contracts are insurance contracts with direct participation features and the entity holds the underlying items (ie there is no economic mismatch between the group of insurance contracts and the related underlying items), the amount included in profit or loss is determined to eliminate accounting mismatches with the finance income or expenses arising on the underlying items held.
When retrospective application is impracticable
The fair value approach requires an entity to determine the contractual service margin by reference to the fair value of the group of insurance contracts at the transition date.
Amendments to the Basis for Conclusions on other IFRS Standards
After paragraph BC3.31, a heading and paragraph BC3.32 are added.
A footnote is added to 'insurance contracts' in paragraph BC60.
A footnote is added to 'insurance contracts' in paragraph BC373.
Scope exclusions — specified contracts such as loan contracts with death waivers
Risk mitigation option using instruments other than derivatives
Contractual service margin attributable to investment-return service and investment-related service
Reinsurance contracts — recovery of losses on underlying insurance contracts
Insurance contracts can be assets or liabilities depending on the timing of their cash flows.
For simplicity, this Basis generally describes the carrying amount as a liability.
This treatment is similar to the treatment of investment components.
The Board also specified that an entity recognises an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows paid (or for which a liability has been recognised applying another IFRS Standard) (see paragraphs BC184L–BC184N).
These considerations were similar to those in developing the Standard as described in paragraph BC174.
An asset for insurance acquisition cash flows is derecognised when those insurance acquisition cash flows are included in the measurement of the group of insurance contracts to which they have been allocated.
This assessment is consistent with other assessments described in paragraph BC382.
These paragraphs apply only to such lease modifications.
This practical expedient applies only to such modifications.
For this purpose, a lease modification is required by interest rate benchmark reform if, and only if, both of these conditions are met
the modification is necessary as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform; and
the new basis for determining the lease payments is economically equivalent to the previous basis (ie the basis immediately preceding the modification).
An entity shall apply these amendments retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8, except as specified in paragraph C20D.
A web site designed for external access may be used for various purposes such as to promote and advertise an entity's own products and services, provide electronic services, and sell products and services.
A web site designed for internal access may be used to store company policies and customer details, and search relevant information.
During this stage, an entity maintains and enhances the applications, infrastructure, graphical design and content of the web site.
the appropriate accounting treatment of such expenditure.
Expenditure incurred in this stage shall be recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
For example, expenditure on purchasing or creating content (other than content that advertises and promotes an entity's own products and services) specifically for a web site, or expenditure to enable use of the content (eg a fee for acquiring a licence to reproduce) on the web site, shall be included in the cost of development when this condition is met.
expenditure incurred in the Content Development stage, to the extent that content is developed to advertise and promote an entity's own products and services (eg digital photographs of products), shall be recognised as an expense when incurred in accordance with IAS 38.69(c).
For example, when accounting for expenditure on professional services for taking digital photographs of an entity's own products and for enhancing their display, expenditure shall be recognised as an expense as the professional services are received during the process, not when the digital photographs are displayed on the web site.
the Operating stage begins once development of a web site is complete.
The best estimate of a web site's useful life should be short.
Therefore, when a web site does not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset, but was previously recognised as an asset, the item shall be derecognised at the date when this Interpretation becomes effective.
When a web site exists and the expenditure to develop it meets the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset, but was not previously recognised as an asset, the intangible asset shall not be recognised at the date when this Interpretation becomes effective.
When a web site exists and the expenditure to develop it meets the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset, was previously recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, the amount initially recognised is deemed to have been properly determined.

TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND EFFECTIVE DATE
This Standard requires an entity to recognise an intangible asset if, and only if, specified criteria are met.
The Standard also specifies how to measure the carrying amount of intangible assets and requires specified disclosures about intangible assets.
intangible assets that are within the scope of another Standard;
expenditure on the development and extraction of minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources.
Therefore, the disclosure requirements in this Standard apply to those intangible assets.
For example, computer software for a computer-controlled machine tool that cannot operate without that specific software is an integral part of the related hardware and it is treated as property, plant and equipment.
The same applies to the operating system of a computer.
When the software is not an integral part of the related hardware, computer software is treated as an intangible asset.
Research and development activities are directed to the development of knowledge.
Therefore, although these activities may result in an asset with physical substance (eg a prototype), the physical element of the asset is secondary to its intangible component, ie the knowledge embodied in it.
Such issues arise in the accounting for expenditure on the exploration for, or development and extraction of, oil, gas and mineral deposits in extractive industries and in the case of insurance contracts.
Therefore, this Standard does not apply to expenditure on such activities and contracts.
However, this Standard applies to other intangible assets used (such as computer software), and other expenditure incurred (such as start-up costs), in extractive industries or by insurers.
Amortisation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an intangible asset over its useful life.
An asset is a resource
from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.
Carrying amount is the amount at which an asset is recognised in the statement of financial position after deducting any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses thereon.
Development is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before the start of commercial production or use.
An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance.
Monetary assets are money held and assets to be received in fixed or determinable amounts of money.
Research is original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
The residual value of an intangible asset is the estimated amount that an entity would currently obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.
Common examples of items encompassed by these broad headings are computer software, patents, copyrights, motion picture films, customer lists, mortgage servicing rights, fishing licences, import quotas, franchises, customer or supplier relationships, customer loyalty, market share and marketing rights.
If an item within the scope of this Standard does not meet the definition of an intangible asset, expenditure to acquire it or generate it internally is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
Goodwill recognised in a business combination is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised.
The future economic benefits may result from synergy between the identifiable assets acquired or from assets that, individually, do not qualify for recognition in the financial statements.
arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations.
The capacity of an entity to control the future economic benefits from an intangible asset would normally stem from legal rights that are enforceable in a court of law.
In the absence of legal rights, it is more difficult to demonstrate control.
However, legal enforceability of a right is not a necessary condition for control because an entity may be able to control the future economic benefits in some other way.
An entity controls those benefits if, for example, the knowledge is protected by legal rights such as copyrights, a restraint of trade agreement (where permitted) or by a legal duty on employees to maintain confidentiality.
The entity may also expect that the staff will continue to make their skills available to the entity.
However, an entity usually has insufficient control over the expected future economic benefits arising from a team of skilled staff and from training for these items to meet the definition of an intangible asset.
For a similar reason, specific management or technical talent is unlikely to meet the definition of an intangible asset, unless it is protected by legal rights to use it and to obtain the future economic benefits expected from it, and it also meets the other parts of the definition.
However, in the absence of legal rights to protect, or other ways to control, the relationships with customers or the loyalty of the customers to the entity, the entity usually has insufficient control over the expected economic benefits from customer relationships and loyalty for such items (eg portfolio of customers, market shares, customer relationships and customer loyalty) to meet the definition of intangible assets.
In the absence of legal rights to protect customer relationships, exchange transactions for the same or similar non-contractual customer relationships (other than as part of a business combination) provide evidence that the entity is nonetheless able to control the expected future economic benefits flowing from the customer relationships.
Because such exchange transactions also provide evidence that the customer relationships are separable, those customer relationships meet the definition of an intangible asset.
For example, the use of intellectual property in a production process may reduce future production costs rather than increase future revenues.
This requirement applies to costs incurred initially to acquire or internally generate an intangible asset and those incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it.
Accordingly, most subsequent expenditures are likely to maintain the expected future economic benefits embodied in an existing intangible asset rather than meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria in this Standard.
In addition, it is often difficult to attribute subsequent expenditure directly to a particular intangible asset rather than to the business as a whole.
This is because such expenditure cannot be distinguished from expenditure to develop the business as a whole.
the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
In other words, the entity expects there to be an inflow of economic benefits, even if there is uncertainty about the timing or the amount of the inflow.
Therefore, the probability recognition criterion in paragraph 21(a) is always considered to be satisfied for separately acquired intangible assets.
This is particularly so when the purchase consideration is in the form of cash or other monetary assets.
any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use.
costs of employee benefits (as defined in IAS 19) arising directly from bringing the asset to its working condition;
costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly.
Therefore, costs incurred in using or redeploying an intangible asset are not included in the carrying amount of that asset.
For example, the following costs are not included in the carrying amount of an intangible asset
initial operating losses, such as those incurred while demand for the asset's output builds up.
These incidental operations may occur before or during the development activities.
Because incidental operations are not necessary to bring an asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the income and related expenses of incidental operations are recognised immediately in profit or loss, and included in their respective classifications of income and expense.
The fair value of an intangible asset will reflect market participants' expectations at the acquisition date about the probability that the expected future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the entity.
Therefore, the probability recognition criterion in paragraph 21(a) is always considered to be satisfied for intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
If an asset acquired in a business combination is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights, sufficient information exists to measure reliably the fair value of the asset.
Thus, the reliable measurement criterion in paragraph 21(b) is always considered to be satisfied for intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
This means that the acquirer recognises as an asset separately from goodwill an in-process research and development project of the acquiree if the project meets the definition of an intangible asset.
An acquiree's in-process research and development project meets the definition of an intangible asset when it
is identifiable, ie is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.
When, for the estimates used to measure an intangible asset's fair value, there is a range of possible outcomes with different probabilities, that uncertainty enters into the measurement of the asset's fair value.
For example, the terms 'brand' and 'brand name' are often used as synonyms for trademarks and other marks.
However, the former are general marketing terms that are typically used to refer to a group of complementary assets such as a trademark (or service mark) and its related trade name, formulas, recipes and technological expertise.
is incurred after the acquisition of that project
recognised as an expense when incurred if it is research expenditure;
This may happen when a government transfers or allocates to an entity intangible assets such as airport landing rights, licences to operate radio or television stations, import licences or quotas or rights to access other restricted resources.
If an entity chooses not to recognise the asset initially at fair value, the entity recognises the asset initially at a nominal amount (the other treatment permitted by IAS 20) plus any expenditure that is directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.
The cost of such an intangible asset is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable.
The fair value of an intangible asset is reliably measurable if (a) the variability in the range of reasonable fair value measurements is not significant for that asset or (b) the probabilities of the various estimates within the range can be reasonably assessed and used when measuring fair value.
If an entity is able to measure reliably the fair value of either the asset received or the asset given up, then the fair value of the asset given up is used to measure cost unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident.
Such expenditure is often described as contributing to internally generated goodwill.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset because it is not an identifiable resource (ie it is not separable nor does it arise from contractual or other legal rights) controlled by the entity that can be measured reliably at cost.
However, such differences do not represent the cost of intangible assets controlled by the entity.
determining the cost of the asset reliably.
Although the terms 'research' and 'development' are defined, the terms 'research phase' and 'development phase' have a broader meaning for the purpose of this Standard.
Expenditure on research (or on the research phase of an internal project) shall be recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
Therefore, this expenditure is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
activities aimed at obtaining new knowledge;
the search for, evaluation and final selection of, applications of research findings or other knowledge;
the formulation, design, evaluation and final selection of possible alternatives for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services.
the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.
its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.
its ability to use or sell the intangible asset.
how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits.
Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset.
the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.
its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
This is because the development phase of a project is further advanced than the research phase.
the design, construction and testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models;
the design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies involving new technology;
the design, construction and testing of a chosen alternative for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services.
In some cases, an entity demonstrates the availability of external finance by obtaining a lender's indication of its willingness to fund the plan.
Therefore, such items are not recognised as intangible assets.
Examples of directly attributable costs are
costs of materials and services used or consumed in generating the intangible asset;
costs of employee benefits (as defined in IAS 19) arising from the generation of the intangible asset;
amortisation of patents and licences that are used to generate the intangible asset.
selling, administrative and other general overhead expenditure unless this expenditure can be directly attributed to preparing the asset for use;
expenditure on training staff to operate the asset.
An entity is developing a new production process.
This expenditure does not form part of the cost of the production process recognised in the statement of financial position.
the item is acquired in a business combination and cannot be recognised as an intangible asset.
If this is the case, it forms part of the amount recognised as goodwill at the acquisition date (see IFRS 3).
In the case of the supply of goods, the entity recognises such expenditure as an expense when it has a right to access those goods.
In the case of the supply of services, the entity recognises the expenditure as an expense when it receives the services.
Other examples of expenditure that is recognised as an expense when it is incurred include
expenditure on advertising and promotional activities (including mail order catalogues).
expenditure on relocating or reorganising part or all of an entity.
An entity has a right to access goods when it owns them.
Similarly, it has a right to access goods when they have been constructed by a supplier in accordance with the terms of a supply contract and the entity could demand delivery of them in return for payment.
Services are received when they are performed by a supplier in accordance with a contract to deliver them to the entity and not when the entity uses them to deliver another service, for example, to deliver an advertisement to customers.
If an intangible asset is accounted for using the revaluation model, all the other assets in its class shall also be accounted for using the same model, unless there is no active market for those assets.
The items within a class of intangible assets are revalued simultaneously to avoid selective revaluation of assets and the reporting of amounts in the financial statements representing a mixture of costs and values as at different dates.
Revaluations shall be made with such regularity that at the end of the reporting period the carrying amount of the asset does not differ materially from its fair value.
the initial recognition of intangible assets at amounts other than cost.
For example, in some jurisdictions, an active market may exist for freely transferable taxi licences, fishing licences or production quotas.
However, an active market cannot exist for brands, newspaper mastheads, music and film publishing rights, patents or trademarks, because each such asset is unique.
Also, although intangible assets are bought and sold, contracts are negotiated between individual buyers and sellers, and transactions are relatively infrequent.
Moreover, prices are often not available to the public.
If the fair value of a revalued asset differs materially from its carrying amount, a further revaluation is necessary.
Such frequent revaluations are unnecessary for intangible assets with only insignificant movements in fair value.
The accumulated amortisation at the date of the revaluation is adjusted to equal the difference between the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount of the asset after taking into account accumulated impairment losses; or
the accumulated amortisation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset.
However, the decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset.
The whole surplus may be realised on the retirement or disposal of the asset.
An intangible asset shall be regarded by the entity as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the entity.
The Illustrative Examples accompanying this Standard illustrate the determination of useful life for different intangible assets, and the subsequent accounting for those assets based on the useful life determinations.
typical product life cycles for the asset and public information on estimates of useful lives of similar assets that are used in a similar way;
technical, technological, commercial or other types of obsolescence;
the stability of the industry in which the asset operates and changes in the market demand for the products or services output from the asset;
expected actions by competitors or potential competitors;
the level of maintenance expenditure required to obtain the expected future economic benefits from the asset and the entity's ability and intention to reach such a level;
The useful life of an intangible asset reflects only that level of future maintenance expenditure required to maintain the asset at its standard of performance assessed at the time of estimating the asset's useful life, and the entity's ability and intention to reach such a level.
A conclusion that the useful life of an intangible asset is indefinite should not depend on planned future expenditure in excess of that required to maintain the asset at that standard of performance.
Therefore, it will often be the case that their useful life is short.
Expected future reductions in the selling price of an item that was produced using an intangible asset could indicate the expectation of technological or commercial obsolescence of the asset, which, in turn, might reflect a reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
Uncertainty justifies estimating the useful life of an intangible asset on a prudent basis, but it does not justify choosing a life that is unrealistically short.
The useful life of a reacquired right recognised as an intangible asset in a business combination is the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted and shall not include renewal periods.
Economic factors determine the period over which future economic benefits will be received by the entity.
Legal factors may restrict the period over which the entity controls access to these benefits.
The useful life is the shorter of the periods determined by these factors.
there is evidence, possibly based on experience, that the contractual or other legal rights will be renewed.
the cost to the entity of renewal is not significant when compared with the future economic benefits expected to flow to the entity from renewal.
If the cost of renewal is significant when compared with the future economic benefits expected to flow to the entity from renewal, the 'renewal' cost represents, in substance, the cost to acquire a new intangible asset at the renewal date.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives
Amortisation shall begin when the asset is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
The amortisation method used shall reflect the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity.
If that pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method shall be used.
There is a rebuttable presumption that an amortisation method that is based on the revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an intangible asset is inappropriate.
The revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an intangible asset typically reflects factors that are not directly linked to the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the intangible asset.
This presumption can be overcome only in the limited circumstances
in which the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue, as described in paragraph 98C; or
when it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated.
Identification of such a predominant limiting factor could serve as the starting point for the identification of the appropriate basis of amortisation, but another basis may be applied if it more closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of economic benefits.
In the circumstance in which the predominant limiting factor that is inherent in an intangible asset is the achievement of a revenue threshold, the revenue to be generated can be an appropriate basis for amortisation.
However, sometimes the future economic benefits embodied in an asset are absorbed in producing other assets.
In this case, the amortisation charge constitutes part of the cost of the other asset and is included in its carrying amount.
there is an active market (as defined in IFRS 13) for the asset and
residual value can be determined by reference to that market; and
it is probable that such a market will exist at the end of the asset's useful life.
If the expected useful life of the asset is different from previous estimates, the amortisation period shall be changed accordingly.
If there has been a change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset, the amortisation method shall be changed to reflect the changed pattern.
For example, the recognition of an impairment loss may indicate that the amortisation period needs to be changed.
For example, it may become apparent that a diminishing balance method of amortisation is appropriate rather than a straight-line method.
Another example is if use of the rights represented by a licence is deferred pending action on other components of the business plan.
In this case, economic benefits that flow from the asset may not be received until later periods.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
As a result, the entity tests the asset for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount, determined in accordance with IAS 36, with its carrying amount, and recognising any excess of the carrying amount over the recoverable amount as an impairment loss.
That Standard explains when and how an entity reviews the carrying amount of its assets, how it determines the recoverable amount of an asset and when it recognises or reverses an impairment loss.
If it is not practicable for an entity to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, it may use the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of the replaced part was at the time it was acquired or internally generated.
whether the useful lives are indefinite or finite and, if finite, the useful lives or the amortisation rates used;
the amortisation methods used for intangible assets with finite useful lives;
the gross carrying amount and any accumulated amortisation (aggregated with accumulated impairment losses) at the beginning and end of the period;
additions, indicating separately those from internal development, those acquired separately, and those acquired through business combinations;
(vi) any amortisation recognised during the period;
(viii) other changes in the carrying amount during the period.
Examples of separate classes may include
copyrights, patents and other industrial property rights, service and operating rights;
Such disclosure may arise from changes in
the assessment of an intangible asset's useful life;
for an intangible asset assessed as having an indefinite useful life, the carrying amount of that asset and the reasons supporting the assessment of an indefinite useful life.
a description, the carrying amount and remaining amortisation period of any individual intangible asset that is material to the entity's financial statements.
for intangible assets acquired by way of a government grant and initially recognised at fair value (see paragraph 44)
the fair value initially recognised for these assets;
(iii) whether they are measured after recognition under the cost model or the revaluation model.
the existence and carrying amounts of intangible assets whose title is restricted and the carrying amounts of intangible assets pledged as security for liabilities.
the amount of contractual commitments for the acquisition of intangible assets.
the carrying amount of revalued intangible assets; and
the amount of the revaluation surplus that relates to intangible assets at the beginning and end of the period, indicating the changes during the period and any restrictions on the distribution of the balance to shareholders.
However, classes are not aggregated if this would result in the combination of a class of intangible assets that includes amounts measured under both the cost and revaluation models.
Thus, the entity shall not adjust the carrying amount of intangible assets recognised at that date.
However, the entity shall, at that date, apply this Standard to reassess the useful lives of such intangible assets.
Therefore, amounts recognised for intangible assets and goodwill in prior business combinations shall not be adjusted.
Some contracts meet the definition of an insurance contract but limit the compensation for insured events to the amount otherwise required to settle the policyholder's obligation created by the contract (for example, loans with death waivers).
The entity shall make that choice for each portfolio of insurance contracts, and the choice for each portfolio is irrevocable.
For example, an insurance contract may include an investment component or a component for services other than insurance contract services (or both).
The entity shall not reassess the composition of the groups subsequently.
An entity shall apply the revised rates from the start of the reporting period in which new contracts are added to the group.
Insurance acquisition cash flows (paragraphs B35A-B35D)
An entity shall recognise such an asset for each related group of insurance contracts.
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall assess the recoverability of an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows if facts and circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired (see paragraph B35D).
If an entity identifies an impairment loss, the entity shall adjust the carrying amount of the asset and recognise the impairment loss in profit or loss.
An entity shall recognise in profit or loss a reversal of some or all of an impairment loss previously recognised applying paragraph 28E and increase the carrying amount of the asset, to the extent that the impairment conditions no longer exist or have improved.
Measurement on initial recognition (paragraphs B36-B95F)
A substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services ends when
any cash flows arising from the contracts in the group at that date;
(c)the derecognition at the date of initial recognition of
any other asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group of contracts as specified in paragraph B66A.
Contractual service margin (paragraphs B96-B119B)
the change in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items (see paragraph B104(b)(i)), except to the extent that
(iii) the increase in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items reverses the amount in (ii).
unfavourable changes relating to future service in the fulfilment cash flows allocated to the group, arising from changes in estimates of future cash flows and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and
for a group of insurance contracts with direct participation features, the decrease in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items.
any subsequent decrease relating to future service in fulfilment cash flows allocated to the group arising from changes in estimates of future cash flows and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and
any subsequent increases in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items.
(iii) plus or minus any amount arising from the derecognition at that date of
minus the amount recognised as insurance revenue for services provided in that period (see paragraph B126); and
the beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held; and
the date the entity recognises an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts applying paragraph 25(c), if the entity entered into the related reinsurance contract held in the group of reinsurance contracts held at or before that date.
Hence, unless paragraph 65A applies, on initial recognition the entity shall recognise any net cost or net gain on purchasing the group of reinsurance contracts held as a contractual service margin measured at an amount equal to the sum of
the amount derecognised at that date of any asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group of reinsurance contracts held;
any cash flows arising at that date; and
If the net cost of purchasing reinsurance coverage relates to events that occurred before the purchase of the group of reinsurance contracts held, notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph B5, the entity shall recognise such a cost immediately in profit or loss as an expense.
(ba) income recognised in profit or loss in the reporting period applying paragraph 66A;
changes in the fulfilment cash flows, measured at the discount rates specified in paragraph B72(c), to the extent that the change relates to future service, unless
(i) the change results from a change in fulfilment cash flows allocated to a group of underlying insurance contracts that does not adjust the contractual service margin for the group of underlying insurance contracts; or
An entity shall adjust the contractual service margin of a group of reinsurance contracts held, and as a result recognise income, when the entity recognises a loss on initial recognition of an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts or on addition of onerous underlying insurance contracts to a group (see paragraphs B119C-B119E).
The loss-recovery component determines the amounts that are presented in profit or loss as reversals of recoveries of losses from reinsurance contracts held and are consequently excluded from the allocation of premiums paid to the reinsurer (see paragraph B119F).
If an entity measures a group of reinsurance contracts held applying the premium allocation approach, the entity shall apply paragraph 66A by adjusting the carrying amount of the asset for remaining coverage instead of adjusting the contractual service margin.
Insurance revenue shall depict the provision of services arising from the group of insurance contracts at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those services.
treat amounts from the reinsurer that it expects to receive that are not contingent on claims of the underlying contracts (for example, some types of ceding commissions) as a reduction in the premiums to be paid to the reinsurer;
paragraph B117A to insurance finance income or expenses arising from the application of paragraph B115 (risk mitigation); and
investment components excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses (combined with refunds of premiums unless refunds of premiums are presented as part of the cash flows in the period described in paragraph 105(a)(i)).
An entity shall separately disclose in the reconciliation required by paragraph 105A any impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses recognised applying paragraph 28E-28F.
the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, as specified in paragraph B124(b);
(iii) the amount of the contractual service margin recognised in profit or loss because of the transfer of insurance contract services in the period, as specified in paragraph B124(c); and
(iv) other amounts, if any, for example, experience adjustments for premium receipts other than those that relate to future service as specified in paragraph B124(d).
(iii) to determine discount rates;
(iv) to determine investment components; and
If the entity uses a technique other than the confidence level technique for determining the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, it shall disclose the technique used and the confidence level corresponding to the results of that technique.
a sensitivity analysis that shows how profit or loss and equity would have been affected by changes in risk variables that were reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period
for each type of market risk -- in a way that explains the relationship between the sensitivities to changes in risk variables arising from insurance contracts and those arising from financial assets held by the entity.

A component of the carrying amount of the asset or liability for a group of insurance contracts representing the unearned profit the entity will recognise as it provides insurance contract services under the insurance contracts in the group.
(a) are onerous, if any;
(b) have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently, if any; or
(c) do not fall into either (a) or (b), if any.
The following services that an entity provides to a policyholder of an insurance contract
(a) coverage for an insured event (insurance coverage);
(b) for insurance contracts without direct participation features, the generation of an investment return for the policyholder, if applicable (investment-return service); and
(c) for insurance contracts with direct participation features, the management of underlying items on behalf of the policyholder (investment-related service).
insurance contract with direct participation features
(a) the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;
An insurance contract that is not an insurance contract with direct participation features.
An uncertain future event covered by an insurance contract that creates insurance risk.
The amounts that an insurance contract requires the entity to repay to a policyholder in all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event occurs.
(c) that are contractually based on
(i)  the returns on a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract;
(iii) the profit or loss of the entity or fund that issues the contract.
(a) investigate and pay valid claims for insured events that have already occurred, including events that have occurred but for which claims have not been reported, and other incurred insurance expenses; and
(i)  insurance contract services that have already been provided; or
(ii)  any investment components or other amounts that are not related to the provision of insurance contract services and that are not in the liability for remaining coverage.
(a) investigate and pay valid claims under existing insurance contracts for insured events that have not yet occurred (ie the obligation that relates to the unexpired portion of the insurance coverage); and
(b) pay amounts under existing insurance contracts that are not included in (a) and that relate to
(i)  insurance contract services not yet provided (ie the obligations that relate to future provision of insurance contract services); or
(ii)  any investment components or other amounts that are not related to the provision of insurance contract services and that have not been transferred to the liability for incurred claims.
risk adjustment for non-financial risk
The compensation an entity requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk as the entity fulfils insurance contracts.
Items that determine some of the amounts payable to a policyholder.
An example is an insurance contract that provides insurance coverage against an adverse development of an event that has already occurred.
For example, the definition includes 'new for old' insurance coverage that pays the policyholder an amount that permits the replacement of a used and damaged asset with a new one.
For the purpose of separation, an entity shall not consider activities that an entity must undertake to fulfil a contract unless the entity transfers a good or service other than insurance contract services to the policyholder as those activities occur.
A good or service other than an insurance contract service that is promised to the policyholder is not distinct if
the entity provides a significant service in integrating the good or service with the insurance components.
Insurance acquisition cash flows (paragraphs 28A-28F)
To apply paragraph 28A, an entity shall use a systematic and rational method to allocate
insurance acquisition cash flows directly attributable to a group of insurance contracts
to groups that will include insurance contracts that are expected to arise from renewals of the insurance contracts in that group.
insurance acquisition cash flows directly attributable to a portfolio of insurance contracts, other than those in (a), to groups of contracts in the portfolio.
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall revise amounts allocated as specified in paragraph B35A to reflect any changes in assumptions that determine the inputs to the method of allocation used.
An entity shall not change amounts allocated to a group of insurance contracts after all contracts have been added to the group (see paragraph B35C).
In those circumstances, an entity shall derecognise the portion of an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows that relates to insurance contracts added to the group in that period and continue to recognise an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows to the extent that the asset relates to insurance contracts expected to be added to the group in a future reporting period.
when an entity allocates insurance acquisition cash flows to groups of insurance contracts applying paragraph B35A(a)(ii), the entity shall recognise an impairment loss in profit or loss and reduce the carrying amount of the related assets for insurance acquisition cash flows to the extent that
the entity expects those insurance acquisition cash flows to exceed the net cash inflow for the expected renewals, determined applying paragraph 32(a); and
the excess determined applying (b)(i) has not already been recognised as an impairment loss applying (a).
When assessing whether the entity has the practical ability to set a price that fully reflects the risks in the contract or portfolio, it shall consider all the risks that it would consider when underwriting equivalent contracts on the renewal date for the remaining service.
(ka) costs the entity will incur
performing investment activity, to the extent the entity performs that activity to enhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders.
Investment activities enhance benefits from insurance coverage if the entity performs those activities expecting to generate an investment return from which policyholders will benefit if an insured event occurs.
providing investment-return service to policyholders of insurance contracts without direct participation features (see paragraph B119B).
(iii) providing investment-related service to policyholders of insurance contracts with direct participation features.
income tax payments and receipts the insurer does not pay or receive in a fiduciary capacity or that are not specifically chargeable to the policyholder under the terms of the contract.
Before the recognition of a group of insurance contracts, an entity might be required to recognise an asset or liability for cash flows related to the group of insurance contracts other than insurance acquisition cash flows either because of the occurrence of the cash flows or because of the requirements of another IFRS Standard.
Cash flows are related to the group of insurance contracts if those cash flows would have been included in the fulfilment cash flows at the date of initial recognition of the group had they been paid or received after that date.
After all insurance contract services have been provided to the contracts in a group, the fulfilment cash flows may still include payments expected to be made to current policyholders in other groups or future policyholders.
Paragraphs B95B-B95F and the heading above paragraph B95E are added.
In a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3, the consideration received or paid is the fair value of the contracts at that date.
For a group of reinsurance contracts held to which paragraphs 66A-66B apply, an entity shall determine the loss-recovery component of the asset for remaining coverage at the date of the transaction by multiplying
the percentage of claims on the underlying insurance contracts the entity expects at the date of the transaction to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held.
The entity shall recognise the amount of the loss-recovery component determined applying paragraph B95B as part of goodwill or gain on a bargain purchase for reinsurance contracts held acquired in a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3, or as income in profit or loss for contracts acquired in a transfer.
To apply paragraph B95B in such cases, an entity shall use a systematic and rational basis of allocation to determine the portion of the loss component of the group of insurance contracts that relates to insurance contracts covered by the group of reinsurance contracts held.
Asset for insurance acquisition cash flows
future insurance contracts that are renewals of insurance contracts recognised at the date of the transaction; and
At the date of the transaction, the amount of any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows shall not be included in the measurement of the acquired group of insurance contracts applying paragraphs B93-B95A.
experience adjustments arising from premiums received in the period that relate to future service, and related cash flows such as insurance acquisition cash flows and premium-based taxes, measured at the discount rates specified in paragraph B72(c).
changes in estimates of the present value of the future cash flows in the liability for remaining coverage, except those described in paragraph B97(a), measured at the discount rates specified in paragraph B72(c).
differences between any investment component expected to become payable in the period and the actual investment component that becomes payable in the period.
(ca) differences between any loan to a policyholder expected to become repayable in the period and the actual loan to a policyholder that becomes repayable in the period.
An entity is not required to disaggregate the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk between (i) a change related to non-financial risk and (ii) the effect of the time value of money and changes in the time value of money.
If an entity makes such a disaggregation, it shall adjust the contractual service margin for the change related to non-financial risk, measured at the discount rates specified in paragraph B72(c).
the effect of the time value of money and changes in the time value of money and the effect of financial risk and changes in financial risk.
the effect, if any, on estimated future cash flows;
the effect, if disaggregated, on the risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and
(iii) the effect of a change in discount rate.
changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows in the liability for incurred claims.
Paragraph B101 is not amended, but is included for ease of reference.
the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items; less
over the duration of the insurance contract; and
Changes in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items (paragraph B104(b)(i)) relate to future service and adjust the contractual service margin, applying paragraph 45(b).
To the extent that an entity meets the conditions in paragraph B116, it may choose not to recognise a change in the contractual service margin to reflect some or all of the changes in the effect of the time value of money and financial risk on
the amount of the entity's share of the underlying items (see paragraph B112) if the entity mitigates the effect of financial risk on that amount using derivatives or reinsurance contracts held; and
the fulfilment cash flows set out in paragraph B113(b) if the entity mitigates the effect of financial risk on those fulfilment cash flows using derivatives, non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, or reinsurance contracts held.
(a) an economic offset exists between the insurance contracts and the derivative, non-derivative financial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss, or reinsurance contract held (ie the values of the insurance contracts and those risk mitigating items generally move in opposite directions because they respond in a similar way to the changes in the risk being mitigated).
B117A If the entity mitigates the effect of financial risk using derivatives or non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, it shall include insurance finance income or expenses for the period arising from the application of paragraph B115 in profit or loss.
If, and only if, any of the conditions in paragraph B116 cease to be met an entity shall cease to apply paragraph B115 from that date.
An entity shall not make any adjustment for changes previously recognised in profit or loss.
An amount of the contractual service margin for a group of insurance contracts is recognised in profit or loss in each period to reflect the insurance contract services provided under the group of insurance contracts in that period (see paragraphs 44(e), 45(e) and 66(e)).
allocating the contractual service margin at the end of the period (before recognising any amounts in profit or loss to reflect the insurance contract services provided in the period) equally to each coverage unit provided in the current period and expected to be provided in the future.
Insurance contracts without direct participation features may provide an investment-return service if, and only if
an investment component exists, or the policyholder has a right to withdraw an amount;
the entity expects to perform investment activity to generate that investment return.
B119C Paragraph 66A applies if, and only if, the reinsurance contract held is entered into before or at the same time as the onerous underlying insurance contracts are recognised.
B119D To apply paragraph 66A, an entity shall determine the adjustment to the contractual service margin of a group of reinsurance contracts held and the resulting income by multiplying
the percentage of claims on the underlying insurance contracts the entity expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held.
The carrying amount of the loss-recovery component shall not exceed the portion of the carrying amount of the loss component of the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts that the entity expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held.
insurance service expenses, excluding any amounts relating to the risk adjustment for non-financial risk included in (ii) and any amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage;
amounts related to income tax that are specifically chargeable to the policyholder;
the amount related to the risk adjustment for non-financial risk (see (b)).
other amounts, if any, for example, experience adjustments for premium receipts other than those that relate to future service (see paragraph B96(a)).
The entity shall allocate the expected premium receipts to each period of insurance contract services
assumptions about inflation based on an index of prices or rates or on prices of assets with inflation-linked returns are assumptions that relate to financial risk;
assumptions about inflation based on an entity's expectation of specific price changes are not assumptions that relate to financial risk; and
changes in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts caused by changes in the value of underlying items (excluding additions and withdrawals) are changes arising from the effect of the time value of money and financial risk and changes therein.
The entity shall apply its choice of accounting policy to all groups of insurance contracts it issues and groups of reinsurance contracts it holds.
Paragraph C2 is not amended, but is included for ease of reference.
an entity shall not apply the option in paragraph B115 for periods before the transition date.
An entity may apply the option in paragraph B115 prospectively on or after the transition date if, and only if, the entity designates risk mitigation relationships at or before the date it applies the option.

the fair value approach in paragraphs C20-C24B.
the entity chooses to apply the risk mitigation option in paragraph B115 to the group of insurance contracts prospectively from the transition date; and
the entity has used derivatives, non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, or reinsurance contracts held to mitigate financial risk arising from the group of insurance contracts, as specified in paragraph B115, before the transition date.
If, and only if, it is impracticable for an entity to apply paragraph C4(aa) for an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows, the entity shall apply the following approaches to measure the asset for insurance acquisition cash flows
the modified retrospective approach in paragraphs C14B-C14D and C17A, subject to paragraph C6(a); or
the fair value approach in paragraphs C24A-C24B.
Paragraphs C9A, C14A-C14D, C16A-C16C and C17A are added.
New text is underlined and deleted text is stuck through.
To achieve the objective of the modified retrospective approach, an entity is permitted to use each modification in paragraphs C9-C19A only to the extent that an entity does not have reasonable and supportable information to apply a retrospective approach.

Applying paragraph B137, an entity may choose not to change the treatment of accounting estimates made in previous interim financial statements.
To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, such an entity shall determine the contractual service margin or loss component at the transition date as if the entity had not prepared interim financial statements before the transition date.
groups of insurance contracts that are expected to be recognised after the transition date.
Insurance acquisition cash flows paid before the transition date that are allocated to a group of insurance contracts recognised at the transition date adjust the contractual service margin of that group, to the extent insurance contracts expected to be in the group have been recognised at that date (see paragraphs 28C and B35C).
If an entity does not have reasonable and supportable information to apply paragraph C14B, the entity shall determine the following amounts to be nil at the transition date
the adjustment to the contractual service margin of a group of insurance contracts recognised at the transition date and any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows relating to that group; and
the asset for insurance acquisition cash flows for groups of insurance contracts expected to be recognised after the transition date.
If applying paragraphs C12-C14D results in a contractual service margin at the date of initial recognition, to determine the contractual service margin at the date of transition an entity shall
If applying paragraphs C12-C14D results in a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage at the date of initial recognition, an entity shall determine any amounts allocated to the loss component before the transition date applying paragraphs C12-C14D and using a systematic basis of allocation.
For a group of reinsurance contracts held that provides coverage for an onerous group of insurance contracts and was entered into before or at the same time that the insurance contracts were issued, an entity shall establish a loss-recovery component of the asset for remaining coverage at the transition date (see paragraphs 66A-66B).
To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, an entity shall determine the loss-recovery component by multiplying
the percentage of claims for the underlying insurance contracts the entity expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held.
To apply paragraph C16A in such cases, an entity shall use a systematic and rational basis of allocation to determine the portion of the loss component of the group of insurance contracts that relates to insurance contracts covered by the group of reinsurance contracts held.
If an entity does not have reasonable and supportable information to apply paragraph C16A, the entity shall not identify a loss-recovery component for the group of reinsurance contracts held.
(iv) insurance acquisition cash flows paid (or for which a liability has been recognised applying another IFRS Standard) before the transition date that are allocated to the group (see paragraph C17A).
To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, an entity shall apply paragraphs C14B-C14D to recognise an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows, and any adjustment to the contractual service margin of a group of insurance contracts with direct participation features for insurance acquisition cash flows (see paragraph C17(c)(iv)).
To the extent permitted by paragraph C8, such an entity shall determine amounts related to insurance finance income or expenses at the transition date as if it had not prepared interim financial statements before the transition date.
For a group of reinsurance contracts held to which paragraphs 66A-66B apply (without the need to meet the condition set out in paragraph B119C), an entity shall determine the loss-recovery component of the asset for remaining coverage at the transition date by multiplying
To apply paragraph C20A in such cases, an entity shall use a systematic and rational basis of allocation to determine the portion of the loss component of the group of insurance contracts that relates to insurance contracts covered by the group of reinsurance contracts held.

future insurance contracts, other than those in (b), after the transition date without paying again insurance acquisition cash flows the entity has already paid that are directly attributable to the related portfolio of insurance contracts.
At the transition date, the entity shall exclude from the measurement of any groups of insurance contracts the amount of any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows.
(iii) an issuer's rights and obligations under insurance contracts that meet the definition of a financial guarantee contract.
The entity may restate prior periods only if it is possible to do so without the use of hindsight.

To accomplish that, this IFRS establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer
determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
This IFRS does not apply to
the accounting for the formation of a joint arrangement in the financial statements of the joint arrangement itself.
the acquisition of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a business.
The cost of the group shall be allocated to the individual identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis of their relative fair values at the date of purchase.
Such a transaction or event does not give rise to goodwill.
a combination of entities or businesses under common control (paragraphs B1–B4 provide related application guidance).
If the assets acquired are not a business, the reporting entity shall account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition.
Paragraphs B5–B12D provide guidance on identifying a business combination and the definition of a business.
recognising and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.
However, the acquirer might obtain control on a date that is either earlier or later than the closing date.
For example, the acquisition date precedes the closing date if a written agreement provides that the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree on a date before the closing date.
An acquirer shall consider all pertinent facts and circumstances in identifying the acquisition date.
For example, the acquirer recognises the acquired identifiable intangible assets, such as a brand name, a patent or a customer relationship, that the acquiree did not recognise as assets in its financial statements because it developed them internally and charged the related costs to expense.
The acquirer shall make those classifications or designations on the basis of the contractual terms, economic conditions, its operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions as they exist at the acquisition date.
Examples of classifications or designations that the acquirer shall make on the basis of the pertinent conditions as they exist at the acquisition date include but are not limited to
the present ownership instruments' proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.
All other components of non-controlling interests shall be measured at their acquisition-date fair values, unless another measurement basis is required by IFRSs.
Instead, the acquirer shall recognise as of the acquisition date a contingent liability assumed in a business combination if it is a present obligation that arises from past events and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Therefore, contrary to IAS 37, the acquirer recognises a contingent liability assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date even if it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
As a result, the acquirer obtains an indemnification asset.
The acquirer shall recognise an indemnification asset at the same time that it recognises the indemnified item measured on the same basis as the indemnified item, subject to the need for a valuation allowance for uncollectible amounts.
Therefore, if the indemnification relates to an asset or a liability that is recognised at the acquisition date and measured at its acquisition-date fair value, the acquirer shall recognise the indemnification asset at the acquisition date measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
For example, an indemnification may relate to a contingent liability that is not recognised at the acquisition date because its fair value is not reliably measurable at that date.
Alternatively, an indemnification may relate to an asset or a liability, for example, one that results from an employee benefit, that is measured on a basis other than acquisition-date fair value.
In those circumstances, the indemnification asset shall be recognised and measured using assumptions consistent with those used to measure the indemnified item, subject to management's assessment of the collectibility of the indemnification asset and any contractual limitations on the indemnified amount.
The acquirer is not required to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for
leases for which the underlying asset is of low value (as described in paragraphs B3–B8 of IFRS 16).
The acquirer shall measure the lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments (as defined in IFRS 16) as if the acquired lease were a new lease at the acquisition date.
The acquirer shall measure the right-of-use asset at the same amount as the lease liability, adjusted to reflect favourable or unfavourable terms of the lease when compared with market terms.
Paragraphs B35 and B36 provide related application guidance.
the consideration transferred measured in accordance with this IFRS, which generally requires acquisition-date fair value (see paragraph 37);
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance with this IFRS; and
the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed measured in accordance with this IFRS.
If so, the acquirer shall determine the amount of goodwill by using the acquisition-date fair value of the acquiree's equity interests instead of the acquisition-date fair value of the equity interests transferred.
To determine the amount of goodwill in a business combination in which no consideration is transferred, the acquirer shall use the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer's interest in the acquiree in place of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred (paragraph 32(a)(i)).
The gain shall be attributed to the acquirer.
The acquirer shall then review the procedures used to measure the amounts this IFRS requires to be recognised at the acquisition date for all of the following
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed;
the non-controlling interest in the acquiree, if any;
The objective of the review is to ensure that the measurements appropriately reflect consideration of all available information as of the acquisition date.
If so, the acquirer shall remeasure the transferred assets or liabilities to their fair values as of the acquisition date and recognise the resulting gains or losses, if any, in profit or loss.
However, sometimes the transferred assets or liabilities remain within the combined entity after the business combination (for example, because the assets or liabilities were transferred to the acquiree rather than to its former owners), and the acquirer therefore retains control of them.
In that situation, the acquirer shall measure those assets and liabilities at their carrying amounts immediately before the acquisition date and shall not recognise a gain or loss in profit or loss on assets or liabilities it controls both before and after the business combination.
The acquirer shall recognise the acquisition-date fair value of contingent consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree.
The acquirer shall classify as an asset a right to the return of previously transferred consideration if specified conditions are met.
In prior reporting periods, the acquirer may have recognised changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income.
If so, the amount that was recognised in other comprehensive income shall be recognised on the same basis as would be required if the acquirer had disposed directly of the previously held equity interest.
In doing so, the acquirer shall remeasure its entire previously held interest in the joint operation.
The acquisition method of accounting for a business combination applies to those combinations.
The acquirer transfers no consideration in exchange for control of an acquiree and holds no equity interests in the acquiree, either on the acquisition date or previously.
In other words, the equity interests in the acquiree held by parties other than the acquirer are a non-controlling interest in the acquirer's post-combination financial statements even if the result is that all of the equity interests in the acquiree are attributed to the non-controlling interest.
During the measurement period, the acquirer shall retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognised as of that date.
During the measurement period, the acquirer shall also recognise additional assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date.
The measurement period ends as soon as the acquirer receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not obtainable.
The measurement period provides the acquirer with a reasonable time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the following as of the acquisition date in accordance with the requirements of this IFRS
the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree;
the consideration transferred for the acquiree (or the other amount used in measuring goodwill);
the resulting goodwill or gain on a bargain purchase.
Pertinent factors include the date when additional information is obtained and whether the acquirer can identify a reason for a change to provisional amounts.
If the acquirer obtains new information during the measurement period about the acquisition-date fair value of that liability, the adjustment to goodwill resulting from a change to the provisional amount recognised for the liability would be offset (in whole or in part) by a corresponding adjustment to goodwill resulting from a change to the provisional amount recognised for the claim receivable from the insurer.
Thus, the acquirer shall revise comparative information for prior periods presented in financial statements as needed, including making any change in depreciation, amortisation or other income effects recognised in completing the initial accounting.
In either situation, the acquirer shall identify any amounts that are not part of what the acquirer and the acquiree (or its former owners) exchanged in the business combination, ie amounts that are not part of the exchange for the acquiree.
The acquirer shall recognise as part of applying the acquisition method only the consideration transferred for the acquiree and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the exchange for the acquiree.
Separate transactions shall be accounted for in accordance with the relevant IFRSs.
The following are examples of separate transactions that are not to be included in applying the acquisition method
a transaction that in effect settles pre-existing relationships between the acquirer and acquiree;
a transaction that reimburses the acquiree or its former owners for paying the acquirer's acquisition-related costs.
Paragraphs B50–B62 provide related application guidance.
However, this IFRS provides guidance on subsequently measuring and accounting for the following assets acquired, liabilities assumed or incurred and equity instruments issued in a business combination
contingent liabilities recognised as of the acquisition date;
Paragraph B63 provides related application guidance.
The acquirer shall derecognise the indemnification asset only when it collects the asset, sells it or otherwise loses the right to it.
However, changes resulting from events after the acquisition date, such as meeting an earnings target, reaching a specified share price or reaching a milestone on a research and development project, are not measurement period adjustments.
The acquirer shall account for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration that are not measurement period adjustments as follows
after the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Application should be prospective from the date when the entity first applied this IFRS.
If an entity applies these amendments earlier it shall also apply all amendments included in Investment Entities at the same time.
If an entity applies that amendment earlier it shall disclose that fact.
Earlier application of these amendments is permitted.
If a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of the combination contingent on future events, the acquirer shall include the amount of that adjustment in the cost of the combination at the acquisition date if the adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably.
The adjustment might, for example, be contingent on a specified level of profit being maintained or achieved in future periods, or on the market price of the instruments issued being maintained.
It is usually possible to estimate the amount of any such adjustment at the time of initially accounting for the combination without impairing the reliability of the information, even though some uncertainty exists.
If the future events do not occur or the estimate needs to be revised, the cost of the business combination shall be adjusted accordingly.
If that adjustment subsequently becomes probable and can be measured reliably, the additional consideration shall be treated as an adjustment to the cost of the combination.
In some circumstances, the acquirer may be required to make a subsequent payment to the seller as compensation for a reduction in the value of the assets given, equity instruments issued or liabilities incurred or assumed by the acquirer in exchange for control of the acquiree.
This is the case, for example, when the acquirer guarantees the market price of equity or debt instruments issued as part of the cost of the business combination and is required to issue additional equity or debt instruments to restore the originally determined cost.
In such cases, no increase in the cost of the business combination is recognised.
In the case of equity instruments, the fair value of the additional payment is offset by an equal reduction in the value attributed to the instruments initially issued.
In the case of debt instruments, the additional payment is regarded as a reduction in the premium or an increase in the discount on the initial issue.
That is to say, the acquirer shall not adjust the accounting for prior business combinations for previously recognised changes in recognised deferred tax assets.
The entity that obtains control of the acquiree.
The date on which the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree.
An integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generating other income from ordinary activities.
Transactions sometimes referred to as 'true mergers' or 'mergers of equals' are also business combinations as that term is used in this IFRS.
Usually, an obligation of the acquirer to transfer additional assets or equity interests to the former owners of an acquiree as part of the exchange for control of the acquiree if specified future events occur or conditions are met.
However, contingent consideration also may give the acquirer the right to the return of previously transferred consideration if specified conditions are met.
For the purposes of this IFRS, equity interests is used broadly to mean ownership interests of investor-owned entities and owner, member or participant interests of mutual entities.
An asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised.
An asset is identifiable if it either
(b)  arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations.
An identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance.
An entity, other than an investor-owned entity, that provides dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits directly to its owners, members or participants.
For example, a mutual insurance company, a credit union and a co-operative entity are all mutual entities.
The equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.
For the purposes of this IFRS, owners is used broadly to include holders of equity interests of investor-owned entities and owners or members of, or participants in, mutual entities.
Business combinations of entities under common control (application of paragraph 2(c))
This IFRS does not apply to a business combination of entities or businesses under common control.
A business combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business combination in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination, and that control is not transitory.
A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an entity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively have the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Therefore, a business combination is outside the scope of this IFRS when the same group of individuals has, as a result of contractual arrangements, ultimate collective power to govern the financial and operating policies of each of the combining entities so as to obtain benefits from their activities, and that ultimate collective power is not transitory.
An entity may be controlled by an individual or by a group of individuals acting together under a contractual arrangement, and that individual or group of individuals may not be subject to the financial reporting requirements of IFRSs.
The extent of non-controlling interests in each of the combining entities before and after the business combination is not relevant to determining whether the combination involves entities under common control.
Similarly, the fact that one of the combining entities is a subsidiary that has been excluded from the consolidated financial statements is not relevant to determining whether a combination involves entities under common control.
An acquirer might obtain control of an acquiree in a variety of ways, for example
by transferring cash, cash equivalents or other assets (including net assets that constitute a business);
A business combination may be structured in a variety of ways for legal, taxation or other reasons, which include but are not limited to
A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs.
Examples include non-current assets (including intangible assets or rights to use non-current assets), intellectual property, the ability to obtain access to necessary materials or rights and employees.
Examples include strategic management processes, operational processes and resource management processes.
Optional test to identify concentration of fair value
Paragraph B7B sets out an optional test (the concentration test) to permit a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business.
An entity may elect to apply, or not apply, the test.
An entity may make such an election separately for each transaction or other event.
The concentration test has the following consequences
if the concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business and no further assessment is needed.
if the concentration test is not met, or if the entity elects not to apply the test, the entity shall then perform the assessment set out in paragraphs B8–B12D.
gross assets acquired shall exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and goodwill resulting from the effects of deferred tax liabilities.
the fair value of the gross assets acquired shall include any consideration transferred (plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held interest) in excess of the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired.
The fair value of the gross assets acquired may normally be determined as the total obtained by adding the fair value of the consideration transferred (plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held interest) to the fair value of the liabilities assumed (other than deferred tax liabilities), and then excluding the items identified in subparagraph (a).
However, if the fair value of the gross assets acquired is more than that total, a more precise calculation may sometimes be needed.
a single identifiable asset shall include any asset or group of assets that would be recognised and measured as a single identifiable asset in a business combination.
when assessing whether assets are similar, an entity shall consider the nature of each single identifiable asset and the risks associated with managing and creating outputs from the assets (that is, the risk characteristics).
the following shall not be considered similar assets
a tangible asset and an intangible asset;
tangible assets in different classes (for example, inventory, manufacturing equipment and automobiles) unless they are considered a single identifiable asset in accordance with the criterion in subparagraph (d);
(v) financial assets in different classes (for example, accounts receivable and investments in equity instruments); and
(vi) identifiable assets that are within the same class of asset but have significantly different risk characteristics.
Although businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of activities and assets to qualify as a business.
A business need not include all of the inputs or processes that the seller used in operating that business.
However, to be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output.
Paragraphs B12–B12D specify how to assess whether a process is substantive.
If an acquired set of activities and assets has outputs, continuation of revenue does not on its own indicate that both an input and a substantive process have been acquired.
Established businesses often have many different types of inputs, processes and outputs, whereas new businesses often have few inputs and processes and sometimes only a single output (product).
Nearly all businesses also have liabilities, but a business need not have liabilities.
Furthermore, an acquired set of activities and assets that is not a business might have liabilities.
Determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business shall be based on whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as a business by a market participant.
Thus, in evaluating whether a particular set is a business, it is not relevant whether a seller operated the set as a business or whether the acquirer intends to operate the set as a business.
Assessing whether an acquired process is substantive
An example of an acquired set of activities and assets that does not have outputs at the acquisition date is an early-stage entity that has not started generating revenue.
Moreover, if an acquired set of activities and assets was generating revenue at the acquisition date, it is considered to have outputs at that date, even if subsequently it will no longer generate revenue from external customers, for example because it will be integrated by the acquirer.
If a set of activities and assets does not have outputs at the acquisition date, an acquired process (or group of processes) shall be considered substantive only if
the inputs acquired include both an organised workforce that has the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process (or group of processes) and other inputs that the organised workforce could develop or convert into outputs.
Those other inputs could include
intellectual property that could be used to develop a good or service;
other economic resources that could be developed to create outputs; or
(iii) rights to obtain access to necessary materials or rights that enable the creation of future outputs.
If a set of activities and assets has outputs at the acquisition date, an acquired process (or group of processes) shall be considered substantive if, when applied to an acquired input or inputs, it
significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and
is considered unique or scarce; or
cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.
Nevertheless, an acquired contract, for example, a contract for outsourced property management or outsourced asset management, may give access to an organised workforce.
An entity shall assess whether an organised workforce accessed through such a contract performs a substantive process that the entity controls, and thus has acquired.
Factors to be considered in making that assessment include the duration of the contract and its renewal terms.
In a business combination effected primarily by transferring cash or other assets or by incurring liabilities, the acquirer is usually the entity that transfers the cash or other assets or incurs the liabilities.
In a business combination effected primarily by exchanging equity interests, the acquirer is usually the entity that issues its equity interests.
However, in some business combinations, commonly called 'reverse acquisitions', the issuing entity is the acquiree.
Paragraphs B19–B27 provide guidance on accounting for reverse acquisitions.
Other pertinent facts and circumstances shall also be considered in identifying the acquirer in a business combination effected by exchanging equity interests, including
In determining which group of owners retains or receives the largest portion of the voting rights, an entity shall consider the existence of any unusual or special voting arrangements and options, warrants or convertible securities.
A new entity formed to effect a business combination is not necessarily the acquirer.
If a new entity is formed to issue equity interests to effect a business combination, one of the combining entities that existed before the business combination shall be identified as the acquirer by applying the guidance in paragraphs B13–B17.
In contrast, a new entity that transfers cash or other assets or incurs liabilities as consideration may be the acquirer.
A reverse acquisition occurs when the entity that issues securities (the legal acquirer) is identified as the acquiree for accounting purposes on the basis of the guidance in paragraphs B13–B18.
The entity whose equity interests are acquired (the legal acquiree) must be the acquirer for accounting purposes for the transaction to be considered a reverse acquisition.
For example, reverse acquisitions sometimes occur when a private operating entity wants to become a public entity but does not want to register its equity shares.
To accomplish that, the private entity will arrange for a public entity to acquire its equity interests in exchange for the equity interests of the public entity.
In this example, the public entity is the legal acquirer because it issued its equity interests, and the private entity is the legal acquiree because its equity interests were acquired.
However, application of the guidance in paragraphs B13–B18 results in identifying
the public entity as the acquiree for accounting purposes (the accounting acquiree); and
the private entity as the acquirer for accounting purposes (the accounting acquirer).
The accounting acquiree must meet the definition of a business for the transaction to be accounted for as a reverse acquisition, and all of the recognition and measurement principles in this IFRS, including the requirement to recognise goodwill, apply.
In a reverse acquisition, the accounting acquirer usually issues no consideration for the acquiree.
Instead, the accounting acquiree usually issues its equity shares to the owners of the accounting acquirer.
Accordingly, the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred by the accounting acquirer for its interest in the accounting acquiree is based on the number of equity interests the legal subsidiary would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal parent the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition.
The fair value of the number of equity interests calculated in that way can be used as the fair value of consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree.
That adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree).
Comparative information presented in those consolidated financial statements also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the legal parent (accounting acquiree).
Because the consolidated financial statements represent the continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary except for its capital structure, the consolidated financial statements reflect
the assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) recognised and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts.
the assets and liabilities of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) recognised and measured in accordance with this IFRS.
the retained earnings and other equity balances of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer) before the business combination.
the amount recognised as issued equity interests in the consolidated financial statements determined by adding the issued equity interest of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value of the legal parent (accounting acquiree).
Accordingly, the equity structure of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) is restated using the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement to reflect the number of shares of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) issued in the reverse acquisition.
the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the legal subsidiary's (accounting acquirer's) pre-combination carrying amounts of retained earnings and other equity interests as discussed in paragraphs B23 and B24.
In a reverse acquisition, some of the owners of the legal acquiree (the accounting acquirer) might not exchange their equity interests for equity interests of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree).
Those owners are treated as a non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial statements after the reverse acquisition.
That is because the owners of the legal acquiree that do not exchange their equity interests for equity interests of the legal acquirer have an interest in only the results and net assets of the legal acquiree — not in the results and net assets of the combined entity.
The assets and liabilities of the legal acquiree are measured and recognised in the consolidated financial statements at their pre-combination carrying amounts (see paragraph B22(a)).
Therefore, in a reverse acquisition the non-controlling interest reflects the non-controlling shareholders' proportionate interest in the pre-combination carrying amounts of the legal acquiree's net assets even if the non-controlling interests in other acquisitions are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date.
As noted in paragraph B22(d), the equity structure in the consolidated financial statements following a reverse acquisition reflects the equity structure of the legal acquirer (the accounting acquiree), including the equity interests issued by the legal acquirer to effect the business combination.
In calculating the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (the denominator of the earnings per share calculation) during the period in which the reverse acquisition occurs
the number of ordinary shares outstanding from the acquisition date to the end of that period shall be the actual number of ordinary shares of the legal acquirer (the accounting acquiree) outstanding during that period.
The basic earnings per share for each comparative period before the acquisition date presented in the consolidated financial statements following a reverse acquisition shall be calculated by dividing
the profit or loss of the legal acquiree attributable to ordinary shareholders in each of those periods by
the legal acquiree's historical weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement.
An intangible asset is identifiable if it meets either the separability criterion or the contractual-legal criterion.
An intangible asset that meets the contractual-legal criterion is identifiable even if the asset is not transferable or separable from the acquiree or from other rights and obligations.
The licence to operate that power plant is an intangible asset that meets the contractual-legal criterion for recognition separately from goodwill, even if the acquirer cannot sell or transfer it separately from the acquired power plant.
An acquirer may recognise the fair value of the operating licence and the fair value of the power plant as a single asset for financial reporting purposes if the useful lives of those assets are similar.
It has licensed that patent to others for their exclusive use outside the domestic market, receiving a specified percentage of future foreign revenue in exchange.
The separability criterion means that an acquired intangible asset is capable of being separated or divided from the acquiree and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or together with a related contract, identifiable asset or liability.
An intangible asset that the acquirer would be able to sell, license or otherwise exchange for something else of value meets the separability criterion even if the acquirer does not intend to sell, license or otherwise exchange it.
An acquired intangible asset meets the separability criterion if there is evidence of exchange transactions for that type of asset or an asset of a similar type, even if those transactions are infrequent and regardless of whether the acquirer is involved in them.
For example, customer and subscriber lists are frequently licensed and thus meet the separability criterion.
Even if an acquiree believes its customer lists have characteristics different from other customer lists, the fact that customer lists are frequently licensed generally means that the acquired customer list meets the separability criterion.
However, a customer list acquired in a business combination would not meet the separability criterion if the terms of confidentiality or other agreements prohibit an entity from selling, leasing or otherwise exchanging information about its customers.
An intangible asset that is not individually separable from the acquiree or combined entity meets the separability criterion if it is separable in combination with a related contract, identifiable asset or liability.
Therefore, the acquirer should recognise the depositor relationship intangible asset separately from goodwill.
To transfer ownership of a trademark, the owner is also required to transfer everything else necessary for the new owner to produce a product or service indistinguishable from that produced by the former owner.
Because the unpatented technical expertise must be separated from the acquiree or combined entity and sold if the related trademark is sold, it meets the separability criterion.
Examples of such rights include a right to use the acquirer's trade name under a franchise agreement or a right to use the acquirer's technology under a technology licensing agreement.
A reacquired right is an identifiable intangible asset that the acquirer recognises separately from goodwill.
If the terms of the contract giving rise to a reacquired right are favourable or unfavourable relative to the terms of current market transactions for the same or similar items, the acquirer shall recognise a settlement gain or loss.
Paragraph B52 provides guidance for measuring that settlement gain or loss.
Assembled workforce and other items that are not identifiable
The acquirer subsumes into goodwill the value of an acquired intangible asset that is not identifiable as of the acquisition date.
Because the assembled workforce is not an identifiable asset to be recognised separately from goodwill, any value attributed to it is subsumed into goodwill.
The acquirer also subsumes into goodwill any value attributed to items that do not qualify as assets at the acquisition date.
For example, the acquirer might attribute value to potential contracts the acquiree is negotiating with prospective new customers at the acquisition date.
Because those potential contracts are not themselves assets at the acquisition date, the acquirer does not recognise them separately from goodwill.
The acquirer should not subsequently reclassify the value of those contracts from goodwill for events that occur after the acquisition date.
However, the acquirer should assess the facts and circumstances surrounding events occurring shortly after the acquisition to determine whether a separately recognisable intangible asset existed at the acquisition date.
The identifiability criteria determine whether an intangible asset is recognised separately from goodwill.
However, the criteria neither provide guidance for measuring the fair value of an intangible asset nor restrict the assumptions used in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset.
For example, the acquirer would take into account the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the intangible asset, such as expectations of future contract renewals, in measuring fair value.
It is not necessary for the renewals themselves to meet the identifiability criteria.
Assets with uncertain cash flows (valuation allowances)
The acquirer shall not recognise a separate valuation allowance as of the acquisition date for assets acquired in a business combination that are measured at their acquisition-date fair values because the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the fair value measure.
For example, because this IFRS requires the acquirer to measure acquired receivables, including loans, at their acquisition-date fair values in accounting for a business combination, the acquirer does not recognise a separate valuation allowance for the contractual cash flows that are deemed to be uncollectible at that date or a loss allowance for expected credit losses.
Assets subject to operating leases in which the acquiree is the lessor
In measuring the acquisition-date fair value of an asset such as a building or a patent that is subject to an operating lease in which the acquiree is the lessor, the acquirer shall take into account the terms of the lease.
The acquirer does not recognise a separate asset or liability if the terms of an operating lease are either favourable or unfavourable when compared with market terms.
To protect its competitive position, or for other reasons, the acquirer may intend not to use an acquired non-financial asset actively, or it may not intend to use the asset according to its highest and best use.
For example, that might be the case for an acquired research and development intangible asset that the acquirer plans to use defensively by preventing others from using it.
Nevertheless, the acquirer shall measure the fair value of the non-financial asset assuming its highest and best use by market participants in accordance with the appropriate valuation premise, both initially and when measuring fair value less costs of disposal for subsequent impairment testing.
Non-controlling interest in an acquiree
This IFRS allows the acquirer to measure a non-controlling interest in the acquiree at its fair value at the acquisition date.
In other situations, however, a quoted price in an active market for the equity shares will not be available.
In those situations, the acquirer would measure the fair value of the non-controlling interest using another valuation technique.
The fair values of the acquirer's interest in the acquiree and the non-controlling interest on a per-share basis might differ.
The main difference is likely to be the inclusion of a control premium in the per-share fair value of the acquirer's interest in the acquiree or, conversely, the inclusion of a discount for lack of control (also referred to as a non-controlling interest discount) in the per-share fair value of the non-controlling interest if market participants would take into account such a premium or discount when pricing the non-controlling interest.
Measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase
Measuring the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer's interest in the acquiree using valuation techniques (application of paragraph 33)
Special considerations in applying the acquisition method to combinations of mutual entities (application of paragraph 33)
In addition, the acquirer in a combination of mutual entities shall recognise the acquiree's net assets as a direct addition to capital or equity in its statement of financial position, not as an addition to retained earnings, which is consistent with the way in which other types of entities apply the acquisition method.
Although they are similar in many ways to other businesses, mutual entities have distinct characteristics that arise primarily because their members are both customers and owners.
Members of mutual entities generally expect to receive benefits for their membership, often in the form of reduced fees charged for goods and services or patronage dividends.
A fair value measurement of a mutual entity should include the assumptions that market participants would make about future member benefits as well as any other relevant assumptions market participants would make about the mutual entity.
For example, a present value technique may be used to measure the fair value of a mutual entity.
The cash flows used as inputs to the model should be based on the expected cash flows of the mutual entity, which are likely to reflect reductions for member benefits, such as reduced fees charged for goods and services.
The acquirer should consider the following factors, which are neither mutually exclusive nor individually conclusive, to determine whether a transaction is part of the exchange for the acquiree or whether the transaction is separate from the business combination
For example, if a transaction is arranged primarily for the benefit of the acquirer or the combined entity rather than primarily for the benefit of the acquiree or its former owners before the combination, that portion of the transaction price paid (and any related assets or liabilities) is less likely to be part of the exchange for the acquiree.
Accordingly, the acquirer would account for that portion separately from the business combination.
who initiated the transaction — Understanding who initiated the transaction may also provide insight into whether it is part of the exchange for the acquiree.
For example, a transaction or other event that is initiated by the acquirer may be entered into for the purpose of providing future economic benefits to the acquirer or combined entity with little or no benefit received by the acquiree or its former owners before the combination.
On the other hand, a transaction or arrangement initiated by the acquiree or its former owners is less likely to be for the benefit of the acquirer or the combined entity and more likely to be part of the business combination transaction.
For example, a transaction between the acquirer and the acquiree that takes place during the negotiations of the terms of a business combination may have been entered into in contemplation of the business combination to provide future economic benefits to the acquirer or the combined entity.
If so, the acquiree or its former owners before the business combination are likely to receive little or no benefit from the transaction except for benefits they receive as part of the combined entity.
Effective settlement of a pre-existing relationship between the acquirer and acquiree in a business combination (application of paragraph 52(a))
The acquirer and acquiree may have a relationship that existed before they contemplated the business combination, referred to here as a 'pre-existing relationship'.
A pre-existing relationship between the acquirer and acquiree may be contractual (for example, vendor and customer or licensor and licensee) or non-contractual (for example, plaintiff and defendant).
If the business combination in effect settles a pre-existing relationship, the acquirer recognises a gain or loss, measured as follows
(An unfavourable contract is a contract that is unfavourable in terms of current market terms.
If (ii) is less than (i), the difference is included as part of the business combination accounting.
The amount of gain or loss recognised may depend in part on whether the acquirer had previously recognised a related asset or liability, and the reported gain or loss therefore may differ from the amount calculated by applying the above requirements.
A pre-existing relationship may be a contract that the acquirer recognises as a reacquired right.
If the contract includes terms that are favourable or unfavourable when compared with pricing for current market transactions for the same or similar items, the acquirer recognises, separately from the business combination, a gain or loss for the effective settlement of the contract, measured in accordance with paragraph B52.
Arrangements for contingent payments to employees or selling shareholders (application of paragraph 52(b))
Whether arrangements for contingent payments to employees or selling shareholders are contingent consideration in the business combination or are separate transactions depends on the nature of the arrangements.
Understanding the reasons why the acquisition agreement includes a provision for contingent payments, who initiated the arrangement and when the parties entered into the arrangement may be helpful in assessing the nature of the arrangement.
If it is not clear whether an arrangement for payments to employees or selling shareholders is part of the exchange for the acquiree or is a transaction separate from the business combination, the acquirer should consider the following indicators
The relevant terms of continuing employment may be included in an employment agreement, acquisition agreement or some other document.
A contingent consideration arrangement in which the payments are automatically forfeited if employment terminates is remuneration for post-combination services.
Arrangements in which the contingent payments are not affected by employment termination may indicate that the contingent payments are additional consideration rather than remuneration.
For example, if the selling shareholders who owned substantially all of the shares in the acquiree continue as key employees, that fact may indicate that the arrangement is, in substance, a profit-sharing arrangement intended to provide remuneration for post-combination services.
Alternatively, if selling shareholders who continue as key employees owned only a small number of shares of the acquiree and all selling shareholders receive the same amount of contingent consideration on a per-share basis, that fact may indicate that the contingent payments are additional consideration.
The pre-acquisition ownership interests held by parties related to selling shareholders who continue as key employees, such as family members, should also be considered.
Alternatively, if the contingent payment formula is consistent with prior profit-sharing arrangements, that fact may suggest that the substance of the arrangement is to provide remuneration.
For example, if a contingent payment is determined on the basis of a multiple of earnings, that might suggest that the obligation is contingent consideration in the business combination and that the formula is intended to establish or verify the fair value of the acquiree.
In contrast, a contingent payment that is a specified percentage of earnings might suggest that the obligation to employees is a profit-sharing arrangement to remunerate employees for services rendered.
For example, in connection with the acquisition, the acquirer might enter into a property lease arrangement with a significant selling shareholder.
If the lease payments specified in the lease contract are significantly below market, some or all of the contingent payments to the lessor (the selling shareholder) required by a separate arrangement for contingent payments might be, in substance, payments for the use of the leased property that the acquirer should recognise separately in its post-combination financial statements.
In contrast, if the lease contract specifies lease payments that are consistent with market terms for the leased property, the arrangement for contingent payments to the selling shareholder may be contingent consideration in the business combination.
Acquirer share-based payment awards exchanged for awards held by the acquiree's employees (application of paragraph 52(b))
If the acquirer replaces the acquiree awards, either all or a portion of the market-based measure of the acquirer's replacement awards shall be included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination.
Paragraphs B57–B62 provide guidance on how to allocate the market-based measure.
That is to say, none of the market-based measure of those awards shall be included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination.
The acquirer is obliged to replace the acquiree awards if the acquiree or its employees have the ability to enforce replacement.
For example, for the purposes of applying this guidance, the acquirer is obliged to replace the acquiree's awards if replacement is required by
the terms of the acquisition agreement;
The portion of the market-based measure of the replacement award that is part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree equals the portion of the acquiree award that is attributable to pre-combination service.
The portion of the replacement award attributable to pre-combination service is the market-based measure of the acquiree award multiplied by the ratio of the portion of the vesting period completed to the greater of the total vesting period or the original vesting period of the acquiree award.
The vesting period is the period during which all the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied.
The portion of a non-vested replacement award attributable to post-combination service, and therefore recognised as remuneration cost in the post-combination financial statements, equals the total market-based measure of the replacement award less the amount attributed to pre-combination service.
Therefore, the acquirer attributes any excess of the market-based measure of the replacement award over the market-based measure of the acquiree award to post-combination service and recognises that excess as remuneration cost in the post-combination financial statements.
The acquirer shall attribute a portion of a replacement award to post-combination service if it requires post-combination service, regardless of whether employees had rendered all of the service required for their acquiree awards to vest before the acquisition date.
The portion of a non-vested replacement award attributable to pre-combination service, as well as the portion attributable to post-combination service, shall reflect the best available estimate of the number of replacement awards expected to vest.
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions of the acquiree
The acquiree may have outstanding share-based payment transactions that the acquirer does not exchange for its share-based payment transactions.
If vested, those acquiree share-based payment transactions are part of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree and are measured at their market-based measure.
The market-based measure of unvested share-based payment transactions is allocated to the non-controlling interest on the basis of the ratio of the portion of the vesting period completed to the greater of the total vesting period and the original vesting period of the share-based payment transaction.
The balance is allocated to post-combination service.

For individually immaterial business combinations occurring during the reporting period that are material collectively, the acquirer shall disclose in aggregate the information required by paragraph B64(e)–(q).
If the acquisition date of a business combination is after the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, the acquirer shall disclose the information required by paragraph B64 unless the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete at the time the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Transitional provisions for business combinations involving only mutual entities or by contract alone (application of paragraph 66)
The requirement to apply this IFRS prospectively has the following effect for a business combination involving only mutual entities or by contract alone if the acquisition date for that business combination is before the application of this IFRS
In determining that amount, the entity shall eliminate the carrying amount of any accumulated amortisation of that goodwill and the corresponding decrease in goodwill.
No other adjustments shall be made to the carrying amount of goodwill.
Furthermore, the entity shall not recognise in profit or loss any part of that goodwill when it disposes of all or part of the business to which that goodwill relates or when a cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates becomes impaired.
In paragraphs B56–B62 the term 'share-based payment awards' refers to vested or unvested share-based payment transactions.
Options, warrants and their equivalents
Contracts that may be settled in ordinary shares or cash
Even though earnings per share data have limitations because of the different accounting policies that may be used for determining 'earnings', a consistently determined denominator enhances financial reporting.
The focus of this Standard is on the denominator of the earnings per share calculation.
whose ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares are traded in a public market (a domestic or foreign stock exchange or an over-the-counter market, including local and regional markets) or
that files, or is in the process of filing, its financial statements with a securities commission or other regulatory organisation for the purpose of issuing ordinary shares in a public market.
An entity that chooses to disclose earnings per share based on its separate financial statements shall present such earnings per share information only in its statement of comprehensive income.
An entity shall not present such earnings per share information in the consolidated financial statements.
Antidilution is an increase in earnings per share or a reduction in loss per share resulting from the assumption that convertible instruments are converted, that options or warrants are exercised, or that ordinary shares are issued upon the satisfaction of specified conditions.
A contingent share agreement is an agreement to issue shares that is dependent on the satisfaction of specified conditions.
Contingently issuable ordinary shares are ordinary shares issuable for little or no cash or other consideration upon the satisfaction of specified conditions in a contingent share agreement.
Dilution is a reduction in earnings per share or an increase in loss per share resulting from the assumption that convertible instruments are converted, that options or warrants are exercised, or that ordinary shares are issued upon the satisfaction of specified conditions.
Options, warrants and their equivalents are financial instruments that give the holder the right to purchase ordinary shares.
An ordinary share is an equity instrument that is subordinate to all other classes of equity instruments.
A potential ordinary share is a financial instrument or other contract that may entitle its holder to ordinary shares.
Put options on ordinary shares are contracts that give the holder the right to sell ordinary shares at a specified price for a given period.
Ordinary shares of the same class have the same rights to receive dividends.
financial liabilities or equity instruments, including preference shares, that are convertible into ordinary shares;
shares that would be issued upon the satisfaction of conditions resulting from contractual arrangements, such as the purchase of a business or other assets.
profit or loss attributable to the parent entity
the after-tax amount of the preference dividends for cumulative preference shares required for the period, whether or not the dividends have been declared.
The amount of preference dividends for the period does not include the amount of any preference dividends for cumulative preference shares paid or declared during the current period in respect of previous periods.
Any original issue discount or premium on increasing rate preference shares is amortised to retained earnings using the effective interest method and treated as a preference dividend for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid to the preference shareholders over the carrying amount of the preference shares represents a return to the holders of the preference shares and a charge to retained earnings for the entity.
This amount is deducted in calculating profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity.
The excess of the fair value of the ordinary shares or other consideration paid over the fair value of the ordinary shares issuable under the original conversion terms is a return to the preference shareholders, and is deducted in calculating profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is the number of ordinary shares outstanding at the beginning of the period, adjusted by the number of ordinary shares bought back or issued during the period multiplied by a time-weighting factor.
ordinary shares issued in exchange for cash are included when cash is receivable;
ordinary shares issued on the voluntary reinvestment of dividends on ordinary or preference shares are included when dividends are reinvested;
ordinary shares issued as a result of the conversion of a debt instrument to ordinary shares are included from the date that interest ceases to accrue;
ordinary shares issued in place of interest or principal on other financial instruments are included from the date that interest ceases to accrue;
ordinary shares issued in exchange for the settlement of a liability of the entity are included from the settlement date;
ordinary shares issued for the rendering of services to the entity are included as the services are rendered.
The timing of the inclusion of ordinary shares is determined by the terms and conditions attaching to their issue.
Due consideration is given to the substance of any contract associated with the issue.
This is because the acquirer incorporates into its statement of comprehensive income the acquiree's profits and losses from that date.
a capitalisation or bonus issue (sometimes referred to as a stock dividend);
a bonus element in any other issue, for example a bonus element in a rights issue to existing shareholders;
a reverse share split (consolidation of shares).
Therefore, the number of ordinary shares outstanding is increased without an increase in resources.
The number of ordinary shares outstanding before the event is adjusted for the proportionate change in the number of ordinary shares outstanding as if the event had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
However, when the overall effect is a share repurchase at fair value, the reduction in the number of ordinary shares outstanding is the result of a corresponding reduction in resources.
An example is a share consolidation combined with a special dividend.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period in which the combined transaction takes place is adjusted for the reduction in the number of ordinary shares from the date the special dividend is recognised.
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is increased by the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
any other changes in income or expense that would result from the conversion of the dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Instead, the new ordinary shares are entitled to participate in profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity.
The expenses associated with potential ordinary shares include transaction costs and discounts accounted for in accordance with the effective interest method (see IFRS 9).
For example, the reduction of interest expense related to potential ordinary shares and the resulting increase in profit or reduction in loss may lead to an increase in the expense related to a non-discretionary employee profit-sharing plan.
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity is adjusted for any such consequential changes in income or expense.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares shall be deemed to have been converted into ordinary shares at the beginning of the period or, if later, the date of the issue of the potential ordinary shares.
Potential ordinary shares that are cancelled or allowed to lapse during the period are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share only for the portion of the period during which they are outstanding.
If these potential ordinary shares of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate have a dilutive effect on the basic earnings per share of the reporting entity, they are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or other issue of potential ordinary shares that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share.
The sequence in which potential ordinary shares are considered may affect whether they are dilutive.
The assumed proceeds from these instruments shall be regarded as having been received from the issue of ordinary shares at the average market price of ordinary shares during the period.
The difference between the number of ordinary shares issued and the number of ordinary shares that would have been issued at the average market price of ordinary shares during the period shall be treated as an issue of ordinary shares for no consideration.
The amount of the dilution is the average market price of ordinary shares during the period minus the issue price.
Therefore, to calculate diluted earnings per share, potential ordinary shares are treated as consisting of both the following
a contract to issue a certain number of the ordinary shares at their average market price during the period.
Such ordinary shares are assumed to be fairly priced and to be neither dilutive nor antidilutive.
They are ignored in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
a contract to issue the remaining ordinary shares for no consideration.
Such ordinary shares generate no proceeds and have no effect on profit or loss attributable to ordinary shares outstanding.
Therefore, such shares are dilutive and are added to the number of ordinary shares outstanding in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
Previously reported earnings per share are not retroactively adjusted to reflect changes in prices of ordinary shares.
They are treated as outstanding on the grant date.
Performance-based employee share options are treated as contingently issuable shares because their issue is contingent upon satisfying specified conditions in addition to the passage of time.
Similarly, convertible debt is antidilutive whenever its interest (net of tax and other changes in income or expense) per ordinary share obtainable on conversion exceeds basic earnings per share.
The shares redeemed or converted are considered separately from those shares that are not redeemed or converted.
Contingently issuable shares are included from the beginning of the period (or from the date of the contingent share agreement, if later).
If the conditions are not satisfied, the number of contingently issuable shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the number of shares that would be issuable if the end of the period were the end of the contingency period.
Restatement is not permitted if the conditions are not met when the contingency period expires.
In that case, the calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the number of ordinary shares that would be issued if the amount of earnings at the end of the reporting period were the amount of earnings at the end of the contingency period.
Because earnings may change in a future period, the calculation of basic earnings per share does not include such contingently issuable ordinary shares until the end of the contingency period because not all necessary conditions have been satisfied.
In that case, if the effect is dilutive, the calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the number of ordinary shares that would be issued if the market price at the end of the reporting period were the market price at the end of the contingency period.
If the condition is based on an average of market prices over a period of time that extends beyond the end of the reporting period, the average for the period of time that has lapsed is used.
Because the market price may change in a future period, the calculation of basic earnings per share does not include such contingently issuable ordinary shares until the end of the contingency period because not all necessary conditions have been satisfied.
In such cases, the number of ordinary shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation is based on both conditions (ie earnings to date and the current market price at the end of the reporting period).
Contingently issuable ordinary shares are not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation unless both conditions are met.
In such cases, assuming that the present status of the condition remains unchanged until the end of the contingency period, the contingently issuable ordinary shares are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share according to the status at the end of the reporting period.
However, exercise or conversion is not assumed for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share unless exercise or conversion of similar outstanding potential ordinary shares that are not contingently issuable is assumed.
Another example is a written put option that gives the holder a choice of settling in ordinary shares or cash.
The put option would be exercised only if the exercise price were higher than the market price and the call option would be exercised only if the exercise price were lower than the market price.
If these contracts are 'in the money' during the period (ie the exercise or settlement price is above the average market price for that period), the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share shall be calculated as follows
it shall be assumed that at the beginning of the period sufficient ordinary shares will be issued (at the average market price during the period) to raise proceeds to satisfy the contract;
the incremental ordinary shares (the difference between the number of ordinary shares assumed issued and the number of ordinary shares received from satisfying the contract) shall be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
If these changes occur after the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, the per share calculations for those and any prior period financial statements presented shall be based on the new number of shares.
The fact that per share calculations reflect such changes in the number of shares shall be disclosed.
In addition, basic and diluted earnings per share of all periods presented shall be adjusted for the effects of errors and adjustments resulting from changes in accounting policies accounted for retrospectively.
An entity shall present basic and diluted earnings per share with equal prominence for all periods presented.
the amounts used as the numerators in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share, and a reconciliation of those amounts to profit or loss attributable to the parent entity for the period.
The reconciliation shall include the individual effect of each class of instruments that affects earnings per share.
the weighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share, and a reconciliation of these denominators to each other.
a description of ordinary share transactions or potential ordinary share transactions, other than those accounted for in accordance with paragraph 64, that occur after the reporting period and that would have changed significantly the number of ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the period if those transactions had occurred before the end of the reporting period.
an issue of shares for cash;
an issue of shares when the proceeds are used to repay debt or preference shares outstanding at the end of the reporting period;
the redemption of ordinary shares outstanding;
the conversion or exercise of potential ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the reporting period into ordinary shares;
the achievement of conditions that would result in the issue of contingently issuable shares.
Earnings per share amounts are not adjusted for such transactions occurring after the reporting period because such transactions do not affect the amount of capital used to produce profit or loss for the period.
These terms and conditions may determine whether any potential ordinary shares are dilutive and, if so, the effect on the weighted average number of shares outstanding and any consequent adjustments to profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders.
Basic and diluted amounts per share relating to such a component shall be disclosed with equal prominence and presented in the notes.
An entity shall indicate the basis on which the numerator(s) is (are) determined, including whether amounts per share are before tax or after tax.
If a component of the statement of comprehensive income is used that is not reported as a line item in the statement of comprehensive income, a reconciliation shall be provided between the component used and a line item that is reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
Profit or loss attributable to the parent entity
For the purpose of calculating earnings per share based on the consolidated financial statements, profit or loss attributable to the parent entity refers to profit or loss of the consolidated entity after adjusting for non-controlling interests.
The issue of ordinary shares at the time of exercise or conversion of potential ordinary shares does not usually give rise to a bonus element.
This is because the potential ordinary shares are usually issued for fair value, resulting in a proportionate change in the resources available to the entity.
In a rights issue, however, the exercise price is often less than the fair value of the shares.
Therefore, as noted in paragraph 27(b), such a rights issue includes a bonus element.
If a rights issue is offered to all existing shareholders, the number of ordinary shares to be used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods before the rights issue is the number of ordinary shares outstanding before the issue, multiplied by the following factor
Fair value per share immediately before the exercise of rights
Theoretical ex-rights fair value per share
The theoretical ex-rights fair value per share is calculated by adding the aggregate fair value of the shares immediately before the exercise of the rights to the proceeds from the exercise of the rights, and dividing by the number of shares outstanding after the exercise of the rights.
The entity's basic earnings per share is CU2.40 for continuing operations, (CU3.60) for discontinued operations and (CU1.20) for the loss.
Average market price of ordinary shares
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the average market price of ordinary shares assumed to be issued is calculated on the basis of the average market price of the ordinary shares during the period.
Theoretically, every market transaction for an entity's ordinary shares could be included in the determination of the average market price.
Generally, closing market prices are adequate for calculating the average market price.
When prices fluctuate widely, however, an average of the high and low prices usually produces a more representative price.
The method used to calculate the average market price is used consistently unless it is no longer representative because of changed conditions.
Options or warrants to purchase convertible instruments are assumed to be exercised to purchase the convertible instrument whenever the average prices of both the convertible instrument and the ordinary shares obtainable upon conversion are above the exercise price of the options or warrants.
However, exercise is not assumed unless conversion of similar outstanding convertible instruments, if any, is also assumed.
Options or warrants may permit or require the tendering of debt or other instruments of the entity (or its parent or a subsidiary) in payment of all or a portion of the exercise price.
In the calculation of diluted earnings per share, those options or warrants are assumed to be exercised and the debt or other instruments are assumed to be tendered.
If tendering cash is more advantageous to the option or warrant holder and the contract permits tendering cash, tendering of cash is assumed.
Interest (net of tax) on any debt assumed to be tendered is added back as an adjustment to the numerator.
Similar treatment is given to preference shares that have similar provisions or to other instruments that have conversion options that permit the investor to pay cash for a more favourable conversion rate.
The underlying terms of certain options or warrants may require the proceeds received from the exercise of those instruments to be applied to redeem debt or other instruments of the entity (or its parent or a subsidiary).
In the calculation of diluted earnings per share, those options or warrants are assumed to be exercised and the proceeds applied to purchase the debt at its average market price rather than to purchase ordinary shares.
However, the excess proceeds received from the assumed exercise over the amount used for the assumed purchase of debt are considered (ie assumed to be used to buy back ordinary shares) in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
Interest (net of tax) on any debt assumed to be purchased is added back as an adjustment to the numerator.
Instruments of subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates
Potential ordinary shares of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate convertible into either ordinary shares of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate, or ordinary shares of the parent or investors with joint control of, or significant influence (the reporting entity) over, the investee are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as follows
instruments issued by a subsidiary, joint venture or associate that enable their holders to obtain ordinary shares of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate are included in calculating the diluted earnings per share data of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate.
Those earnings per share are then included in the reporting entity's earnings per share calculations based on the reporting entity's holding of the instruments of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate.
instruments of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate that are convertible into the reporting entity's ordinary shares are considered among the potential ordinary shares of the reporting entity for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share.
Likewise, options or warrants issued by a subsidiary, joint venture or associate to purchase ordinary shares of the reporting entity are considered among the potential ordinary shares of the reporting entity in the calculation of consolidated diluted earnings per share.
In addition to those adjustments, the numerator is adjusted for any change in the profit or loss recorded by the reporting entity (such as dividend income or equity method income) that is attributable to the increase in the number of ordinary shares of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate outstanding as a result of the assumed conversion.
The denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation is not affected because the number of ordinary shares of the reporting entity outstanding would not change upon assumed conversion.
The equity of some entities includes
a class of ordinary shares with a different dividend rate from that of another class of ordinary shares but without prior or senior rights.
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, conversion is assumed for those instruments described in paragraph A13 that are convertible into ordinary shares if the effect is dilutive.
For those instruments that are not convertible into a class of ordinary shares, profit or loss for the period is allocated to the different classes of shares and participating equity instruments in accordance with their dividend rights or other rights to participate in undistributed earnings.
To calculate basic and diluted earnings per share
profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity is adjusted (a profit reduced and a loss increased) by the amount of dividends declared in the period for each class of shares and by the contractual amount of dividends (or interest on participating bonds) that must be paid for the period (for example, unpaid cumulative dividends).
the remaining profit or loss is allocated to ordinary shares and participating equity instruments to the extent that each instrument shares in earnings as if all of the profit or loss for the period had been distributed.
The total profit or loss allocated to each class of equity instrument is determined by adding together the amount allocated for dividends and the amount allocated for a participation feature.
the total amount of profit or loss allocated to each class of equity instrument is divided by the number of outstanding instruments to which the earnings are allocated to determine the earnings per share for the instrument.
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, all potential ordinary shares assumed to have been issued are included in outstanding ordinary shares.
Where ordinary shares are issued but not fully paid, they are treated in the calculation of basic earnings per share as a fraction of an ordinary share to the extent that they were entitled to participate in dividends during the period relative to a fully paid ordinary share.
To the extent that partly paid shares are not entitled to participate in dividends during the period they are treated as the equivalent of warrants or options in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
The unpaid balance is assumed to represent proceeds used to purchase ordinary shares.
The number of shares included in diluted earnings per share is the difference between the number of shares subscribed and the number of shares assumed to be purchased.
events after the reporting period
Adjusting events after the reporting period
Non-adjusting events after the reporting period
Date of authorisation for issue
Updating disclosure about conditions at the end of the reporting period
the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the financial statements were authorised for issue and about events after the reporting period.
The Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial statements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period indicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate.
Events after the reporting period are those events, favourable and unfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period and the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the reporting period (non-adjusting events after the reporting period).
In such cases, the financial statements are authorised for issue on the date of issue, not the date when shareholders approve the financial statements.
In such cases, the financial statements are authorised for issue when the management authorises them for issue to the supervisory board.
The supervisory board is made up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of employees and other outside interests.
the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that confirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the reporting period.
the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that an asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that the amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that asset needs to be adjusted.
the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting period usually confirms that the customer was credit-impaired at the end of the reporting period; and
the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give evidence about their net realisable value at the end of the reporting period.
the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets purchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of the reporting period.
the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial statements are incorrect.
The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition of the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects circumstances that have arisen subsequently.
Therefore, an entity does not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the investments.
If the going concern assumption is no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard requires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than an adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of accounting.
management is aware of material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
The events or conditions requiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period.
If the entity's owners or others have the power to amend the financial statements after issue, the entity shall disclose that fact.
In addition to considering whether it should recognise or change a provision under IAS 37, an entity updates its disclosures about the contingent liability in the light of that evidence.
Accordingly, an entity shall disclose the following for each material category of non-adjusting event after the reporting period
the nature of the event; and
an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made.
announcing a plan to discontinue an operation;
the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the reporting period;
announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major restructuring (see IAS 37);
abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset prices or foreign exchange rates;
commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that occurred after the reporting period.
The higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

It sets out overall requirements for the presentation of financial statements, guidelines for their structure and minimum requirements for their content.
If entities with not-for-profit activities in the private sector or the public sector apply this Standard, they may need to amend the descriptions used for particular line items in the financial statements and for the financial statements themselves.
General purpose financial statements (referred to as 'financial statements') are those intended to meet the needs of users who are not in a position to require an entity to prepare reports tailored to their particular information needs.
Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.
An entity assesses whether information, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of its financial statements taken as a whole.
Information is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar effect for primary users of financial statements to omitting or misstating that information.
The following are examples of circumstances that may result in material information being obscured
information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is disclosed in the financial statements but the language used is vague or unclear;
information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is scattered throughout the financial statements;
dissimilar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately aggregated;
similar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately disaggregated; and
the understandability of the financial statements is reduced as a result of material information being hidden by immaterial information to the extent that a primary user is unable to determine what information is material.
Assessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users of a specific reporting entity's general purpose financial statements requires an entity to consider the characteristics of those users while also considering the entity's own circumstances.
Many existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors cannot require reporting entities to provide information directly to them and must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial information they need.
Consequently, they are the primary users to whom general purpose financial statements are directed.
Financial statements are prepared for users who have a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently.
Notes provide narrative descriptions or disaggregations of items presented in those statements and information about items that do not qualify for recognition in those statements.
Other comprehensive income comprises items of income and expense (including reclassification adjustments) that are not recognised in profit or loss as required or permitted by other IFRSs.
Owners are holders of instruments classified as equity.
Profit or loss is the total of income less expenses, excluding the components of other comprehensive income.
Reclassification adjustments are amounts reclassified to profit or loss in the current period that were recognised in other comprehensive income in the current or previous periods.
Total comprehensive income is the change in equity during a period resulting from transactions and other events, other than those changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners.
Total comprehensive income comprises all components of 'profit or loss' and of 'other comprehensive income'.
For example, an entity may use the term 'net income' to describe profit or loss.
puttable financial instrument classified as an equity instrument (described in paragraphs 16A and 16B of IAS 32)
To meet this objective, financial statements provide information about an entity's
income and expenses, including gains and losses;
This information, along with other information in the notes, assists users of financial statements in predicting the entity's future cash flows and, in particular, their timing and certainty.
An entity may present the profit or loss section in a separate statement of profit or loss.
Such a report may include a review of
the main factors and influences determining financial performance, including changes in the environment in which the entity operates, the entity's response to those changes and their effect, and the entity's policy for investment to maintain and enhance financial performance, including its dividend policy;
the entity's resources not recognised in the statement of financial position in accordance with IFRSs.
Reports and statements presented outside financial statements are outside the scope of IFRSs.
Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework).
The application of IFRSs, with additional disclosure when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation.
An entity shall not describe financial statements as complying with IFRSs unless they comply with all the requirements of IFRSs.
A fair presentation also requires an entity
to present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information.
that management has concluded that the financial statements present fairly the entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows;
that it has complied with applicable IFRSs, except that it has departed from a particular requirement to achieve a fair presentation;
for each period presented, the financial effect of the departure on each item in the financial statements that would have been reported in complying with the requirement.
for each period presented, the adjustments to each item in the financial statements that management has concluded would be necessary to achieve a fair presentation.
When assessing whether complying with a specific requirement in an IFRS would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective of financial statements set out in the Conceptual Framework, management considers
how the entity's circumstances differ from those of other entities that comply with the requirement.
If other entities in similar circumstances comply with the requirement, there is a rebuttable presumption that the entity's compliance with the requirement would not be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective of financial statements set out in the Conceptual Framework.
An entity shall prepare financial statements on a going concern basis unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
When management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, the entity shall disclose those uncertainties.
When an entity does not prepare financial statements on a going concern basis, it shall disclose that fact, together with the basis on which it prepared the financial statements and the reason why the entity is not regarded as a going concern.
The degree of consideration depends on the facts in each case.
When an entity has a history of profitable operations and ready access to financial resources, the entity may reach a conclusion that the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate without detailed analysis.
In other cases, management may need to consider a wide range of factors relating to current and expected profitability, debt repayment schedules and potential sources of replacement financing before it can satisfy itself that the going concern basis is appropriate.
An entity shall present separately items of a dissimilar nature or function unless they are immaterial.
The final stage in the process of aggregation and classification is the presentation of condensed and classified data, which form line items in the financial statements.
If a line item is not individually material, it is aggregated with other items either in those statements or in the notes.
An item that is not sufficiently material to warrant separate presentation in those statements may warrant separate presentation in the notes.
When applying this and other IFRSs an entity shall decide, taking into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances, how it aggregates information in the financial statements, which include the notes.
An entity shall not reduce the understandability of its financial statements by obscuring material information with immaterial information or by aggregating material items that have different natures or functions.
An entity need not provide a specific disclosure required by an IFRS if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material.
This is the case even if the IFRS contains a list of specific requirements or describes them as minimum requirements.
An entity shall also consider whether to provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users of financial statements to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial performance.
For example, the amount of revenue recognised reflects any trade discounts and volume rebates the entity allows.
An entity undertakes, in the course of its ordinary activities, other transactions that do not generate revenue but are incidental to the main revenue-generating activities.
An entity presents the results of such transactions, when this presentation reflects the substance of the transaction or other event, by netting any income with related expenses arising on the same transaction.
However, an entity presents such gains and losses separately if they are material.
the fact that amounts presented in the financial statements are not entirely comparable.
This Standard does not preclude this practice.
An entity shall include comparative information for narrative and descriptive information if it is relevant to understanding the current period's financial statements.
An entity may present comparative information in addition to the minimum comparative financial statements required by IFRSs, as long as that information is prepared in accordance with IFRSs.
When this is the case, the entity shall present related note information for those additional statements.
The entity is required to present, in the notes to the financial statements, the comparative information related to that additional statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
the retrospective application, retrospective restatement or the reclassification has a material effect on the information in the statement of financial position at the beginning of the preceding period.
the end of the current period;
the end of the preceding period; and
the beginning of the preceding period.
However, it need not present the related notes to the opening statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period.
The date of that opening statement of financial position shall be as at the beginning of the preceding period regardless of whether an entity's financial statements present comparative information for earlier periods (as permitted in paragraph 38C).
When an entity reclassifies comparative amounts, it shall disclose (including as at the beginning of the preceding period)
the nature of the reclassification;
In some circumstances, it is impracticable to reclassify comparative information for a particular prior period to achieve comparability with the current period.
an IFRS requires a change in presentation.
An entity changes the presentation of its financial statements only if the changed presentation provides information that is reliable and more relevant to users of the financial statements and the revised structure is likely to continue, so that comparability is not impaired.
Disclosures are also required by other IFRSs.
Unless specified to the contrary elsewhere in this Standard or in another IFRS, such disclosures may be made in the financial statements.
Therefore, it is important that users can distinguish information that is prepared using IFRSs from other information that may be useful to users but is not the subject of those requirements.
In addition, an entity shall display the following information prominently, and repeat it when necessary for the information presented to be understandable
the name of the reporting entity or other means of identification, and any change in that information from the end of the preceding reporting period;
whether the financial statements are of an individual entity or a group of entities;
the date of the end of the reporting period or the period covered by the set of financial statements or notes;
the level of rounding used in presenting amounts in the financial statements.
Judgement is required in determining the best way of presenting such information.
This is acceptable as long as the entity discloses the level of rounding and does not omit material information.
financial assets (excluding amounts shown under (e), (h) and (i));
investments accounted for using the equity method;
(m) financial liabilities (excluding amounts shown under (k) and (l));
issued capital and reserves attributable to owners of the parent.
When an entity presents subtotals in accordance with paragraph 55, those subtotals shall
be comprised of line items made up of amounts recognised and measured in accordance with IFRS;
be presented and labelled in a manner that makes the line items that constitute the subtotal clear and understandable;
not be displayed with more prominence than the subtotals and totals required in IFRS for the statement of financial position.
the descriptions used and the ordering of items or aggregation of similar items may be amended according to the nature of the entity and its transactions, to provide information that is relevant to an understanding of the entity's financial position.
For example, a financial institution may amend the above descriptions to provide information that is relevant to the operations of a financial institution.
the nature and liquidity of assets;
the amounts, nature and timing of liabilities.
When that exception applies, an entity shall present all assets and liabilities in order of liquidity.
It also highlights assets that are expected to be realised within the current operating cycle, and liabilities that are due for settlement within the same period.
The need for a mixed basis of presentation might arise when an entity has diverse operations.
Financial assets include trade and other receivables, and financial liabilities include trade and other payables.
it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or consume it, in its normal operating cycle;
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading;
An entity shall classify all other assets as non-current.
It does not prohibit the use of alternative descriptions as long as the meaning is clear.
Current assets also include assets held primarily for the purpose of trading (examples include some financial assets that meet the definition of held for trading in IFRS 9) and the current portion of non-current financial assets.
Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification.
However, when refinancing or rolling over the obligation is not at the discretion of the entity (for example, there is no arrangement for refinancing), the entity does not consider the potential to refinance the obligation and classifies the obligation as current.
refinancing on a long-term basis;
The disclosures vary for each item, for example
receivables are disaggregated into amounts receivable from trade customers, receivables from related parties, prepayments and other amounts;
for each class of share capital
the number of shares issued and fully paid, and issued but not fully paid;
(iii) par value per share, or that the shares have no par value;
the rights, preferences and restrictions attaching to that class including restrictions on the distribution of dividends and the repayment of capital;
(vi) shares in the entity held by the entity or by its subsidiaries or associates; and
a description of the nature and purpose of each reserve within equity.
If an entity has reclassified
a puttable financial instrument classified as an equity instrument, or
an instrument that imposes on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation and is classified as an equity instrument
between financial liabilities and equity, it shall disclose the amount reclassified into and out of each category (financial liabilities or equity), and the timing and reason for that reclassification.
The statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (statement of comprehensive income) shall present, in addition to the profit or loss and other comprehensive income sections
comprehensive income for the period, being the total of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
If an entity presents a separate statement of profit or loss it does not present the profit or loss section in the statement presenting comprehensive income.
An entity shall present the following items, in addition to the profit or loss and other comprehensive income sections, as allocation of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the period
profit or loss for the period attributable to
comprehensive income for the period attributable to
If an entity presents profit or loss in a separate statement it shall present (a) in that statement.
revenue, presenting separately interest revenue calculated using the effective interest method;
(aa) gains and losses arising from the derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost;
share of the profit or loss of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method;
(ca) if a financial asset is reclassified out of the amortised cost measurement category so that it is measured at fair value through profit or loss, any gain or loss arising from a difference between the previous amortised cost of the financial asset and its fair value at the reclassification date (as defined in IFRS 9);
(cb) if a financial asset is reclassified out of the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category so that it is measured at fair value through profit or loss, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income that is reclassified to profit or loss;
(ea) a single amount for the total of discontinued operations (see IFRS 5).
The other comprehensive income section shall present line items for the amounts for the period of
items of other comprehensive income (excluding amounts in paragraph (b)), classified by nature and grouped into those that, in accordance with other IFRSs
(i) will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss; and
(ii) will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are met.
the share of the other comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, separated into the share of items that, in accordance with other IFRSs
will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are met.
An entity considers factors including materiality and the nature and function of the items of income and expense.
For example, a financial institution may amend the descriptions to provide information that is relevant to the operations of a financial institution.
net of related tax effects, or
If an entity elects alternative (b), it shall allocate the tax between the items that might be reclassified subsequently to the profit or loss section and those that will not be reclassified subsequently to the profit or loss section.
Such reclassifications are referred to in this Standard as reclassification adjustments.
A reclassification adjustment is included with the related component of other comprehensive income in the period that the adjustment is reclassified to profit or loss.
These amounts may have been recognised in other comprehensive income as unrealised gains in the current or previous periods.
An entity presenting reclassification adjustments in the notes presents the items of other comprehensive income after any related reclassification adjustments.
These components are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
In accordance with IFRS 9, reclassification adjustments do not arise if a cash flow hedge or the accounting for the time value of an option (or the forward element of a forward contract or the foreign currency basis spread of a financial instrument) result in amounts that are removed from the cash flow hedge reserve or a separate component of equity, respectively, and included directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount of an asset or a liability.
These amounts are directly transferred to assets or liabilities.
write-downs of inventories to net realisable value or of property, plant and equipment to recoverable amount, as well as reversals of such write-downs;
restructurings of the activities of an entity and reversals of any provisions for the costs of restructuring;
disposals of items of property, plant and equipment;
An entity aggregates expenses within profit or loss according to their nature (for example, depreciation, purchases of materials, transport costs, employee benefits and advertising costs), and does not reallocate them among functions within the entity.
This method may be simple to apply because no allocations of expenses to functional classifications are necessary.
An example of a classification using the nature of expense method is as follows
Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress
Raw materials and consumables used
At a minimum, an entity discloses its cost of sales under this method separately from other expenses.
This method can provide more relevant information to users than the classification of expenses by nature, but allocating costs to functions may require arbitrary allocations and involve considerable judgement.
An example of a classification using the function of expense method is as follows
Both methods provide an indication of those costs that might vary, directly or indirectly, with the level of sales or production of the entity.
Because each method of presentation has merit for different types of entities, this Standard requires management to select the presentation that is reliable and more relevant.
However, because information on the nature of expenses is useful in predicting future cash flows, additional disclosure is required when the function of expense classification is used.
The statement of changes in equity includes the following information
total comprehensive income for the period, showing separately the total amounts attributable to owners of the parent and to non-controlling interests;
For each component of equity an entity shall present, either in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes, an analysis of other comprehensive income by item (see paragraph 106(d)(ii)).
Except for changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners (such as equity contributions, reacquisitions of the entity's own equity instruments and dividends) and transaction costs directly related to such transactions, the overall change in equity during a period represents the total amount of income and expense, including gains and losses, generated by the entity's activities during that period.
Retrospective adjustments and retrospective restatements are not changes in equity but they are adjustments to the opening balance of retained earnings, except when an IFRS requires retrospective adjustment of another component of equity.
Paragraph 106(b) requires disclosure in the statement of changes in equity of the total adjustment to each component of equity resulting from changes in accounting policies and, separately, from corrections of errors.
These adjustments are disclosed for each prior period and the beginning of the period.
provide information that is not presented elsewhere in the financial statements, but is relevant to an understanding of any of them.
In determining a systematic manner, the entity shall consider the effect on the understandability and comparability of its financial statements.
giving prominence to the areas of its activities that the entity considers to be most relevant to an understanding of its financial performance and financial position, such as grouping together information about particular operating activities;
contingent liabilities (see IAS 37) and unrecognised contractual commitments; and
non-financial disclosures, eg the entity's financial risk management objectives and policies (see IFRS 7).
the other accounting policies used that are relevant to an understanding of the financial statements.
Each entity considers the nature of its operations and the policies that the users of its financial statements would expect to be disclosed for that type of entity.
Disclosure of particular accounting policies is especially useful to users when those policies are selected from alternatives allowed in IFRSs.
Some IFRSs specifically require disclosure of particular accounting policies, including choices made by management between different policies they allow.
For example, management makes judgements in determining
when substantially all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of financial assets and, for lessors, assets subject to leases are transferred to other entities; and
whether, in substance, particular sales of goods are financing arrangements and therefore do not give rise to revenue; and
whether the contractual terms of a financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
In respect of those assets and liabilities, the notes shall include details of
their carrying amount as at the end of the reporting period.
For example, in the absence of recently observed market prices, future-oriented estimates are necessary to measure the recoverable amount of classes of property, plant and equipment, the effect of technological obsolescence on inventories, provisions subject to the future outcome of litigation in progress, and long-term employee benefit liabilities such as pension obligations.
These estimates involve assumptions about such items as the risk adjustment to cash flows or discount rates, future changes in salaries and future changes in prices affecting other costs.
As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increases, those judgements become more subjective and complex, and the potential for a consequential material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities normally increases accordingly.
The nature and extent of the information provided vary according to the nature of the assumption and other circumstances.
Examples of the types of disclosures an entity makes are
the nature of the assumption or other estimation uncertainty;
the sensitivity of carrying amounts to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying their calculation, including the reasons for the sensitivity;
an explanation of changes made to past assumptions concerning those assets and liabilities, if the uncertainty remains unresolved.
In all cases, the entity discloses the nature and carrying amount of the specific asset or liability (or class of assets or liabilities) affected by the assumption.
qualitative information about its objectives, policies and processes for managing capital, including
a description of what it manages as capital;
when an entity is subject to externally imposed capital requirements, the nature of those requirements and how those requirements are incorporated into the management of capital; and
summary quantitative data about what it manages as capital.
Some entities regard some financial liabilities (eg some forms of subordinated debt) as part of capital.
Other entities regard capital as excluding some components of equity (eg components arising from cash flow hedges).
any changes in (a) and (b) from the previous period.
whether during the period it complied with any externally imposed capital requirements to which it is subject.
when the entity has not complied with such externally imposed capital requirements, the consequences of such non-compliance.
The entity bases these disclosures on the information provided internally to key management personnel.
For example, a conglomerate may include entities that undertake insurance activities and banking activities and those entities may operate in several jurisdictions.
When an aggregate disclosure of capital requirements and how capital is managed would not provide useful information or distorts a financial statement user's understanding of an entity's capital resources, the entity shall disclose separate information for each capital requirement to which the entity is subject.
For puttable financial instruments classified as equity instruments, an entity shall disclose (to the extent not disclosed elsewhere)
summary quantitative data about the amount classified as equity;
its objectives, policies and processes for managing its obligation to repurchase or redeem the instruments when required to do so by the instrument holders, including any changes from the previous period;
information about how the expected cash outflow on redemption or repurchase was determined.
the amount of any cumulative preference dividends not recognised.
the domicile and legal form of the entity, its country of incorporation and the address of its registered office (or principal place of business, if different from the registered office);
a description of the nature of the entity's operations and its principal activities;
if it is a limited life entity, information regarding the length of its life.
If an entity adopts this Standard for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact.

SUMMARY OF THE APPROACH REQUIRED BY THIS STANDARD
REPORTING FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY
Reporting at the ends of subsequent reporting periods
Translation to the presentation currency
Translation of a foreign operation
Disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation
TAX EFFECTS OF ALL EXCHANGE DIFFERENCES
It may have transactions in foreign currencies or it may have foreign operations.
In addition, an entity may present its financial statements in a foreign currency.
The objective of this Standard is to prescribe how to include foreign currency transactions and foreign operations in the financial statements of an entity and how to translate financial statements into a presentation currency.
in translating an entity's results and financial position into a presentation currency.
In addition, this Standard applies when an entity translates amounts relating to derivatives from its functional currency to its presentation currency.
For translations of financial information into a foreign currency that do not meet these requirements, this Standard specifies information to be disclosed.
Closing rate is the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.
Foreign currency is a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.
Foreign operation is an entity that is a subsidiary, associate, joint arrangement or branch of a reporting entity, the activities of which are based or conducted in a country or currency other than those of the reporting entity.
Functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
A group is a parent and all its subsidiaries.
Monetary items are units of currency held and assets and liabilities to be received or paid in a fixed or determinable number of units of currency.
Net investment in a foreign operation is the amount of the reporting entity's interest in the net assets of that operation.
Presentation currency is the currency in which the financial statements are presented.
Spot exchange rate is the exchange rate for immediate delivery.
An entity considers the following factors in determining its functional currency
of the country whose competitive forces and regulations mainly determine the sales prices of its goods and services.
the currency in which funds from financing activities (ie issuing debt and equity instruments) are generated.
the currency in which receipts from operating activities are usually retained.
whether the activities of the foreign operation are carried out as an extension of the reporting entity, rather than being carried out with a significant degree of autonomy.
An example of the former is when the foreign operation only sells goods imported from the reporting entity and remits the proceeds to it.
An example of the latter is when the operation accumulates cash and other monetary items, incurs expenses, generates income and arranges borrowings, all substantially in its local currency.
whether transactions with the reporting entity are a high or a low proportion of the foreign operation's activities.
whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation directly affect the cash flows of the reporting entity and are readily available for remittance to it.
whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation are sufficient to service existing and normally expected debt obligations without funds being made available by the reporting entity.
Accordingly, once determined, the functional currency is not changed unless there is a change in those underlying transactions, events and conditions.
Such monetary items may include long-term receivables or loans.
They do not include trade receivables or trade payables.
This would also be true if Subsidiary A were itself a foreign operation.
Examples include: pensions and other employee benefits to be paid in cash; provisions that are to be settled in cash; lease liabilities; and cash dividends that are recognised as a liability.
Conversely, the essential feature of a non-monetary item is the absence of a right to receive (or an obligation to deliver) a fixed or determinable number of units of currency.
Examples include: amounts prepaid for goods and services; goodwill; intangible assets; inventories; property, plant and equipment; right-of-use assets; and provisions that are to be settled by the delivery of a non-monetary asset.
Summary of the approach required by this Standard
Various types of entities, whether members of a group or otherwise, may have investments in associates or joint arrangements.
They may also have branches.
It is necessary for the results and financial position of each individual entity included in the reporting entity to be translated into the currency in which the reporting entity presents its financial statements.
This Standard permits the presentation currency of a reporting entity to be any currency (or currencies).
Reporting foreign currency transactions in the functional currency
However, if exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of the average rate for a period is inappropriate.
foreign currency monetary items shall be translated using the closing rate;
non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency shall be translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.
Whether the carrying amount is determined on the basis of historical cost or on the basis of fair value, if the amount is determined in a foreign currency it is then translated into the functional currency in accordance with this Standard.
When such an asset is non-monetary and is measured in a foreign currency, the carrying amount is determined by comparing
the net realisable value or recoverable amount, as appropriate, translated at the exchange rate at the date when that value was determined (eg the closing rate at the end of the reporting period).
The effect of this comparison may be that an impairment loss is recognised in the functional currency but would not be recognised in the foreign currency, or vice versa.
The application of hedge accounting requires an entity to account for some exchange differences differently from the treatment of exchange differences required by this Standard.
When the transaction is settled within the same accounting period as that in which it occurred, all the exchange difference is recognised in that period.
However, when the transaction is settled in a subsequent accounting period, the exchange difference recognised in each period up to the date of settlement is determined by the change in exchange rates during each period.
When such an asset is measured in a foreign currency, paragraph 23(c) of this Standard requires the revalued amount to be translated using the rate at the date the value is determined, resulting in an exchange difference that is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Such exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the financial statements that include the foreign operation and the reporting entity (ie financial statements in which the foreign operation is consolidated or accounted for using the equity method).
This produces the same amounts in the functional currency as would have occurred had the items been recorded initially in the functional currency.
For example, monetary items are translated into the functional currency using the closing rate, and non-monetary items that are measured on a historical cost basis are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction that resulted in their recognition.
Accordingly, once the functional currency is determined, it can be changed only if there is a change to those underlying transactions, events and conditions.
In other words, an entity translates all items into the new functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the change.
The resulting translated amounts for non-monetary items are treated as their historical cost.
Use of a presentation currency other than the functional currency
If the presentation currency differs from the entity's functional currency, it translates its results and financial position into the presentation currency.
For example, when a group contains individual entities with different functional currencies, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in a common currency so that consolidated financial statements may be presented.
assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented (ie including comparatives) shall be translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position;
all resulting exchange differences shall be recognised in other comprehensive income.
translating income and expenses at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions and assets and liabilities at the closing rate.
translating the opening net assets at a closing rate that differs from the previous closing rate.
These exchange differences are not recognised in profit or loss because the changes in exchange rates have little or no direct effect on the present and future cash flows from operations.
The cumulative amount of the exchange differences is presented in a separate component of equity until disposal of the foreign operation.
When the exchange differences relate to a foreign operation that is consolidated but not wholly-owned, accumulated exchange differences arising from translation and attributable to non-controlling interests are allocated to, and recognised as part of, non-controlling interests in the consolidated statement of financial position.
When the economy ceases to be hyperinflationary and the entity no longer restates its financial statements in accordance with IAS 29, it shall use as the historical costs for translation into the presentation currency the amounts restated to the price level at the date the entity ceased restating its financial statements.
However, an intragroup monetary asset (or liability), whether short-term or long-term, cannot be eliminated against the corresponding intragroup liability (or asset) without showing the results of currency fluctuations in the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, in the consolidated financial statements of the reporting entity, such an exchange difference is recognised in profit or loss or, if it arises from the circumstances described in paragraph 32, it is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of the foreign operation.
In such a case, the assets and liabilities of the foreign operation are translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period of the foreign operation.
In addition to the disposal of an entity's entire interest in a foreign operation, the following partial disposals are accounted for as disposals
when the retained interest after the partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or a partial disposal of an interest in an associate that includes a foreign operation is a financial asset that includes a foreign operation.
On disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation that have been attributed to the non-controlling interests shall be derecognised, but shall not be reclassified to profit or loss.
On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the entity shall re-attribute the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income to the non-controlling interests in that foreign operation.
In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation the entity shall reclassify to profit or loss only the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income.
A write-down of the carrying amount of a foreign operation, either because of its own losses or because of an impairment recognised by the investor, does not constitute a partial disposal.
Accordingly, no part of the foreign exchange gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss at the time of a write-down.
Tax effects of all exchange differences
net exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity, and a reconciliation of the amount of such exchange differences at the beginning and end of the period.
For example, an entity may convert into another currency only selected items from its financial statements.
Or, an entity whose functional currency is not the currency of a hyperinflationary economy may convert the financial statements into another currency by translating all items at the most recent closing rate.
clearly identify the information as supplementary information to distinguish it from the information that complies with IFRSs;
disclose the entity's functional currency and the method of translation used to determine the supplementary information.
Therefore, those goodwill and fair value adjustments either are already expressed in the entity's functional currency or are non-monetary foreign currency items, which are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the acquisition.

The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment for income taxes.
The principal issue in accounting for income taxes is how to account for the current and future tax consequences of
transactions and other events of the current period that are recognised in an entity's financial statements.
It is inherent in the recognition of an asset or liability that the reporting entity expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of that asset or liability.
This Standard requires an entity to account for the tax consequences of transactions and other events in the same way that it accounts for the transactions and other events themselves.
Thus, for transactions and other events recognised in profit or loss, any related tax effects are also recognised in profit or loss.
For transactions and other events recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), any related tax effects are also recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively).
Similarly, the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities in a business combination affects the amount of goodwill arising in that business combination or the amount of the bargain purchase gain recognised.
This Standard also deals with the recognition of deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or unused tax credits, the presentation of income taxes in the financial statements and the disclosure of information relating to income taxes.
Income taxes also include taxes, such as withholding taxes, which are payable by a subsidiary, associate or joint arrangement on distributions to the reporting entity.
However, this Standard does deal with the accounting for temporary differences that may arise from such grants or investment tax credits.
Accounting profit is profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense.
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for a period.
Deferred tax liabilities are the amounts of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are the amounts of income taxes recoverable in future periods in respect of
the carryforward of unused tax credits.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base.
Temporary differences may be either
deductible temporary differences, which are temporary differences that will result in amounts that are deductible in determining taxable profit (tax loss) of future periods when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled.
The tax base of an asset or liability is the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax purposes.
If those economic benefits will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset is equal to its carrying amount.
The related interest revenue will be taxed on a cash basis.
The tax base of the interest receivable is nil.
The related revenue has already been included in taxable profit (tax loss).
The dividends are not taxable.
In substance, the entire carrying amount of the asset is deductible against the economic benefits.
Under both analyses, there is no deferred tax liability.
In the case of revenue which is received in advance, the tax base of the resulting liability is its carrying amount, less any amount of the revenue that will not be taxable in future periods.
The related expense will be deducted for tax purposes on a cash basis.
The tax base of the accrued expenses is nil.
The related interest revenue was taxed on a cash basis.
The tax base of the interest received in advance is nil.
The related expense has already been deducted for tax purposes.
Fines and penalties are not deductible for tax purposes.
Under both analyses, there is no deferred tax asset.
The difference between the tax base of the research costs, being the amount the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods, and the carrying amount of nil is a deductible temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset.
Example C following paragraph 51A illustrates circumstances when it may be helpful to consider this fundamental principle, for example, when the tax base of an asset or liability depends on the expected manner of recovery or settlement.
The tax base is determined by reference to a consolidated tax return in those jurisdictions in which such a return is filed.
In other jurisdictions, the tax base is determined by reference to the tax returns of each entity in the group.
Recognition of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which
at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss).
When the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its tax base, the amount of taxable economic benefits will exceed the amount that will be allowed as a deduction for tax purposes.
This difference is a taxable temporary difference and the obligation to pay the resulting income taxes in future periods is a deferred tax liability.
As the entity recovers the carrying amount of the asset, the taxable temporary difference will reverse and the entity will have taxable profit.
This makes it probable that economic benefits will flow from the entity in the form of tax payments.
Such temporary differences are often described as timing differences.
The following are examples of temporary differences of this kind which are taxable temporary differences and which therefore result in deferred tax liabilities
interest revenue is included in accounting profit on a time proportion basis but may, in some jurisdictions, be included in taxable profit when cash is collected.
The tax base of any receivable recognised in the statement of financial position with respect to such revenues is nil because the revenues do not affect taxable profit until cash is collected;
depreciation used in determining taxable profit (tax loss) may differ from that used in determining accounting profit.
The temporary difference is the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its tax base which is the original cost of the asset less all deductions in respect of that asset permitted by the taxation authorities in determining taxable profit of the current and prior periods.
development costs may be capitalised and amortised over future periods in determining accounting profit but deducted in determining taxable profit in the period in which they are incurred.
Such development costs have a tax base of nil as they have already been deducted from taxable profit.
The temporary difference is the difference between the carrying amount of the development costs and their tax base of nil.
goodwill arises in a business combination (see paragraph 21);
Temporary differences arise when the tax bases of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not affected by the business combination or are affected differently.
For example, when the carrying amount of an asset is increased to fair value but the tax base of the asset remains at cost to the previous owner, a taxable temporary difference arises which results in a deferred tax liability.
In some jurisdictions, the revaluation or other restatement of an asset to fair value affects taxable profit (tax loss) for the current period.
As a result, the tax base of the asset is adjusted and no temporary difference arises.
In other jurisdictions, the revaluation or restatement of an asset does not affect taxable profit in the period of the revaluation or restatement and, consequently, the tax base of the asset is not adjusted.
Nevertheless, the future recovery of the carrying amount will result in a taxable flow of economic benefits to the entity and the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes will differ from the amount of those economic benefits.
The difference between the carrying amount of a revalued asset and its tax base is a temporary difference and gives rise to a deferred tax liability or asset.
This is true even if
the entity does not intend to dispose of the asset.
tax on capital gains is deferred if the proceeds of the disposal of the asset are invested in similar assets.
In such cases, the tax will ultimately become payable on sale or use of the similar assets.
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree recognised in accordance with IFRS 3; and
Many taxation authorities do not allow reductions in the carrying amount of goodwill as a deductible expense in determining taxable profit.
Moreover, in such jurisdictions, the cost of goodwill is often not deductible when a subsidiary disposes of its underlying business.
In such jurisdictions, goodwill has a tax base of nil.
Any difference between the carrying amount of goodwill and its tax base of nil is a taxable temporary difference.
However, this Standard does not permit the recognition of the resulting deferred tax liability because goodwill is measured as a residual and the recognition of the deferred tax liability would increase the carrying amount of goodwill.
Subsequent reductions in a deferred tax liability that is unrecognised because it arises from the initial recognition of goodwill are also regarded as arising from the initial recognition of goodwill and are therefore not recognised under paragraph 15(a).
That decrease in the value of the unrecognised deferred tax liability is also regarded as relating to the initial recognition of the goodwill and is therefore prohibited from being recognised under paragraph 15(a).
Deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences relating to goodwill are, however, recognised to the extent they do not arise from the initial recognition of goodwill.
Because that taxable temporary difference does not relate to the initial recognition of the goodwill, the resulting deferred tax liability is recognised.
The method of accounting for such a temporary difference depends on the nature of the transaction that led to the initial recognition of the asset or liability
if the transaction affects either accounting profit or taxable profit, an entity recognises any deferred tax liability or asset and recognises the resulting deferred tax expense or income in profit or loss (see paragraph 59);
Such adjustments would make the financial statements less transparent.
Therefore, this Standard does not permit an entity to recognise the resulting deferred tax liability or asset, either on initial recognition or subsequently (see example below).
Depreciation of the asset is not deductible for tax purposes.
On disposal, any capital gain would not be taxable and any capital loss would not be deductible.
In some jurisdictions, the tax base of the liability component on initial recognition is equal to the initial carrying amount of the sum of the liability and equity components.
The resulting taxable temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of the equity component separately from the liability component.
Therefore, the exception set out in paragraph 15(b) does not apply.
Consequently, an entity recognises the resulting deferred tax liability.
In accordance with paragraph 61A, the deferred tax is charged directly to the carrying amount of the equity component.
When resources flow from the entity, part or all of their amounts may be deductible in determining taxable profit of a period later than the period in which the liability is recognised.
In such cases, a temporary difference exists between the carrying amount of the liability and its tax base.
Accordingly, a deferred tax asset arises in respect of the income taxes that will be recoverable in the future periods when that part of the liability is allowed as a deduction in determining taxable profit.
Similarly, if the carrying amount of an asset is less than its tax base, the difference gives rise to a deferred tax asset in respect of the income taxes that will be recoverable in future periods.
For tax purposes, the product warranty costs will not be deductible until the entity pays claims.
retirement benefit costs may be deducted in determining accounting profit as service is provided by the employee, but deducted in determining taxable profit either when contributions are paid to a fund by the entity or when retirement benefits are paid by the entity.
Such a deductible temporary difference results in a deferred tax asset as economic benefits will flow to the entity in the form of a deduction from taxable profits when contributions or retirement benefits are paid;
The difference between the tax base of the research costs, being the amount the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods, and the carrying amount of nil is a deductible temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset;
with limited exceptions, an entity recognises the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their fair values at the acquisition date.
A deferred tax asset also arises when the fair value of an identifiable asset acquired is less than its tax base.
A deductible temporary difference arises if the tax base of the asset exceeds its carrying amount.
The debt instrument is measured at fair value.
It is probable that Entity A will collect all the contractual cash flows if it continues to hold the debt instrument.
Any gains (losses) on the debt instrument are taxable (deductible) only when realised.
The gains (losses) arising on the sale or maturity of the debt instrument are calculated for tax purposes as the difference between the amount collected and the original cost of the debt instrument.
Accordingly, the tax base of the debt instrument is its original cost.
However, economic benefits in the form of reductions in tax payments will flow to the entity only if it earns sufficient taxable profits against which the deductions can be offset.
Therefore, an entity recognises deferred tax assets only when it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
When an entity assesses whether taxable profits will be available against which it can utilise a deductible temporary difference, it considers whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits against which it may make deductions on the reversal of that deductible temporary difference.
If tax law imposes no such restrictions, an entity assesses a deductible temporary difference in combination with all of its other deductible temporary differences.
However, if tax law restricts the utilisation of losses to deduction against income of a specific type, a deductible temporary difference is assessed in combination only with other deductible temporary differences of the appropriate type.
in periods into which a tax loss arising from the deferred tax asset can be carried back or forward.
In such circumstances, the deferred tax asset is recognised in the period in which the deductible temporary differences arise.
it is probable that the entity will have sufficient taxable profit relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity in the same period as the reversal of the deductible temporary difference (or in the periods into which a tax loss arising from the deferred tax asset can be carried back or forward).
In evaluating whether it will have sufficient taxable profit in future periods, an entity
tax planning opportunities are available to the entity that will create taxable profit in appropriate periods.
The estimate of probable future taxable profit may include the recovery of some of an entity's assets for more than their carrying amount if there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the entity will achieve this.
For example, when an asset is measured at fair value, the entity shall consider whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that it is probable that the entity will recover the asset for more than its carrying amount.
This may be the case, for example, when an entity expects to hold a fixed-rate debt instrument and collect the contractual cash flows.
For example, in some jurisdictions, taxable profit may be created or increased by
electing to have interest income taxed on either a received or receivable basis;
deferring the claim for certain deductions from taxable profit;
If the carrying amount of goodwill arising in a business combination is less than its tax base, the difference gives rise to a deferred tax asset.
The deferred tax asset arising from the initial recognition of goodwill shall be recognised as part of the accounting for a business combination to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference could be utilised.
Government grants may also be set up as deferred income in which case the difference between the deferred income and its tax base of nil is a deductible temporary difference.
However, the existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit may not be available.
Therefore, when an entity has a history of recent losses, the entity recognises a deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses or tax credits only to the extent that the entity has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised by the entity.
whether the entity has sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, which will result in taxable amounts against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised before they expire;
whether it is probable that the entity will have taxable profits before the unused tax losses or unused tax credits expire;
To the extent that it is not probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised, the deferred tax asset is not recognised.
The entity recognises a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Such differences may arise in a number of different circumstances, for example
the existence of undistributed profits of subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint arrangements;
a reduction in the carrying amount of an investment in an associate to its recoverable amount.
In consolidated financial statements, the temporary difference may be different from the temporary difference associated with that investment in the parent's separate financial statements if the parent carries the investment in its separate financial statements at cost or revalued amount.
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, it would often be impracticable to determine the amount of income taxes that would be payable when the temporary difference reverses.
Therefore, when the parent has determined that those profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future the parent does not recognise a deferred tax liability.
The same considerations apply to investments in branches.
Therefore, in the absence of an agreement requiring that the profits of the associate will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, an investor recognises a deferred tax liability arising from taxable temporary differences associated with its investment in the associate.
In some cases, an investor may not be able to determine the amount of tax that would be payable if it recovers the cost of its investment in an associate, but can determine that it will equal or exceed a minimum amount.
When the joint venturer or joint operator can control the timing of the distribution of its share of the profits of the joint arrangement and it is probable that its share of the profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, a deferred tax liability is not recognised.
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
In these circumstances, tax assets and liabilities are measured using the announced tax rate (and tax laws).
In some jurisdictions, the manner in which an entity recovers (settles) the carrying amount of an asset (liability) may affect either or both of
the tax rate applicable when the entity recovers (settles) the carrying amount of the asset (liability); and
the tax base of the asset (liability).
In such cases, an entity measures deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets using the tax rate and the tax base that are consistent with the expected manner of recovery or settlement.
No equivalent adjustment is made for tax purposes.
Proceeds in excess of cost
If a deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset arises from a non-depreciable asset measured using the revaluation model in IAS 16, the measurement of the deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset shall reflect the tax consequences of recovering the carrying amount of the non-depreciable asset through sale, regardless of the basis of measuring the carrying amount of that asset.
Accordingly, if the tax law specifies a tax rate applicable to the taxable amount derived from the sale of an asset that differs from the tax rate applicable to the taxable amount derived from using an asset, the former rate is applied in measuring the deferred tax liability or asset related to a non-depreciable asset.
If a deferred tax liability or asset arises from investment property that is measured using the fair value model in IAS 40, there is a rebuttable presumption that the carrying amount of the investment property will be recovered through sale.
Accordingly, unless the presumption is rebutted, the measurement of the deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset shall reflect the tax consequences of recovering the carrying amount of the investment property entirely through sale.
This presumption is rebutted if the investment property is depreciable and is held within a business model whose objective is to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment property over time, rather than through sale.
The land has an unlimited useful life.
Unrealised changes in the fair value of the investment property do not affect taxable profit.
Because the investment property is measured using the fair value model in IAS 40, there is a rebuttable presumption that the entity will recover the carrying amount of the investment property entirely through sale.
If that presumption is not rebutted, the deferred tax reflects the tax consequences of recovering the carrying amount entirely through sale, even if the entity expects to earn rental income from the property before sale.
Therefore the presumption of recovery through sale would not be rebutted for the land.
It follows that the deferred tax liability would reflect the tax consequences of recovering the carrying amount of the building through use and the carrying amount of the land through sale.
The rebuttable presumption in paragraph 51C also applies when a deferred tax liability or a deferred tax asset arises from measuring investment property in a business combination if the entity will use the fair value model when subsequently measuring that investment property.
In some jurisdictions, income taxes are payable at a higher or lower rate if part or all of the net profit or retained earnings is paid out as a dividend to shareholders of the entity.
In some other jurisdictions, income taxes may be refundable or payable if part or all of the net profit or retained earnings is paid out as a dividend to shareholders of the entity.
In these circumstances, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits.
Example illustrating paragraphs 52A and 57A
No asset is recognised for the amount potentially recoverable as a result of future dividends.
In many cases such scheduling is impracticable or highly complex.
Therefore, it is inappropriate to require discounting of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
To permit, but not to require, discounting would result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which would not be comparable between entities.
Therefore, this Standard does not require or permit the discounting of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
An entity shall reduce the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Any such reduction shall be reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.
Recognition of current and deferred tax
The income tax consequences of dividends are linked more directly to past transactions or events that generated distributable profits than to distributions to owners.
Therefore, an entity shall recognise the income tax consequences of dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the entity originally recognised those past transactions or events.
The resulting deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss.
This can result, for example, from
a change in tax rates or tax laws;
a change in the expected manner of recovery of an asset.
Current tax and deferred tax shall be recognised outside profit or loss if the tax relates to items that are recognised, in the same or a different period, outside profit or loss.
Therefore, current tax and deferred tax that relates to items that are recognised, in the same or a different period
directly in equity, shall be recognised directly in equity (see paragraph 62A).
Examples of such items are
exchange differences arising on the translation of the financial statements of a foreign operation (see IAS 21).
International Financial Reporting Standards require or permit particular items to be credited or charged directly to equity.
This may be the case, for example, when
an entity determines that a deferred tax asset should be recognised, or should no longer be recognised in full, and the deferred tax asset relates (in whole or in part) to an item that was previously recognised outside profit or loss.
In such cases, the current and deferred tax related to items that are recognised outside profit or loss are based on a reasonable pro rata allocation of the current and deferred tax of the entity in the tax jurisdiction concerned, or other method that achieves a more appropriate allocation in the circumstances.
If an entity makes such a transfer, the amount transferred is net of any related deferred tax.
Similar considerations apply to transfers made on disposal of an item of property, plant or equipment.
However, if the revaluation for tax purposes is not related to an accounting revaluation of an earlier period, or to one that is expected to be carried out in a future period, the tax effects of the adjustment of the tax base are recognised in profit or loss.
When an entity pays dividends to its shareholders, it may be required to pay a portion of the dividends to taxation authorities on behalf of shareholders.
In many jurisdictions, this amount is referred to as a withholding tax.
Such an amount paid or payable to taxation authorities is charged to equity as a part of the dividends.
Consequently, those deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities affect the amount of goodwill or the bargain purchase gain the entity recognises.
An acquirer may consider it probable that it will recover its own deferred tax asset that was not recognised before the business combination.
For example, the acquirer may be able to utilise the benefit of its unused tax losses against the future taxable profit of the acquiree.
Alternatively, as a result of the business combination it might no longer be probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
In such cases, the acquirer recognises a change in the deferred tax asset in the period of the business combination, but does not include it as part of the accounting for the business combination.
An entity shall recognise acquired deferred tax benefits that it realises after the business combination as follows
In some tax jurisdictions, an entity receives a tax deduction (ie an amount that is deductible in determining taxable profit) that relates to remuneration paid in shares, share options or other equity instruments of the entity.
The amount of that tax deduction may differ from the related cumulative remuneration expense, and may arise in a later accounting period.
If the amount the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods is not known at the end of the period, it shall be estimated, based on information available at the end of the period.
For example, if the amount that the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods is dependent upon the entity's share price at a future date, the measurement of the deductible temporary difference should be based on the entity's share price at the end of the period.
As noted in paragraph 68A, the amount of the tax deduction (or estimated future tax deduction, measured in accordance with paragraph 68B) may differ from the related cumulative remuneration expense.
If the amount of the tax deduction (or estimated future tax deduction) exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense, this indicates that the tax deduction relates not only to remuneration expense but also to an equity item.
In this situation, the excess of the associated current or deferred tax should be recognised directly in equity.
An entity will normally have a legally enforceable right to set off a current tax asset against a current tax liability when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the taxation authority permits the entity to make or receive a single net payment.
the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either
the same taxable entity; or
different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.
Accordingly, where exchange differences on deferred foreign tax liabilities or assets are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, such differences may be classified as deferred tax expense (income) if that presentation is considered to be the most useful to financial statement users.
any adjustments recognised in the period for current tax of prior periods;
the amount of deferred tax expense (income) relating to the origination and reversal of temporary differences;
the amount of deferred tax expense (income) relating to changes in tax rates or the imposition of new taxes;
the amount of the benefit arising from a previously unrecognised tax loss, tax credit or temporary difference of a prior period that is used to reduce current tax expense;
the amount of the benefit from a previously unrecognised tax loss, tax credit or temporary difference of a prior period that is used to reduce deferred tax expense;
the aggregate current and deferred tax relating to items that are charged or credited directly to equity (see paragraph 62A);
an explanation of the relationship between tax expense (income) and accounting profit in either or both of the following forms
a numerical reconciliation between the average effective tax rate and the applicable tax rate, disclosing also the basis on which the applicable tax rate is computed;
the amount (and expiry date, if any) of deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, and unused tax credits for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the statement of financial position;
in respect of each type of temporary difference, and in respect of each type of unused tax losses and unused tax credits
the amount of the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position for each period presented;
the amount of the deferred tax income or expense recognised in profit or loss, if this is not apparent from the changes in the amounts recognised in the statement of financial position;
in respect of discontinued operations, the tax expense relating to
the profit or loss from the ordinary activities of the discontinued operation for the period, together with the corresponding amounts for each prior period presented;
the amount of income tax consequences of dividends to shareholders of the entity that were proposed or declared before the financial statements were authorised for issue, but are not recognised as a liability in the financial statements;
the entity has suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period in the tax jurisdiction to which the deferred tax asset relates.
In the circumstances described in paragraph 52A, an entity shall disclose the nature of the potential income tax consequences that would result from the payment of dividends to its shareholders.
In addition, the entity shall disclose the amounts of the potential income tax consequences practicably determinable and whether there are any potential income tax consequences not practicably determinable.
The relationship between tax expense (income) and accounting profit may be affected by such factors as revenue that is exempt from taxation, expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit (tax loss), the effect of tax losses and the effect of foreign tax rates.
Often, the most meaningful rate is the domestic rate of tax in the country in which the entity is domiciled, aggregating the tax rate applied for national taxes with the rates applied for any local taxes which are computed on a substantially similar level of taxable profit (tax loss).
However, for an entity operating in several jurisdictions, it may be more meaningful to aggregate separate reconciliations prepared using the domestic rate in each individual jurisdiction.
The following example illustrates how the selection of the applicable tax rate affects the presentation of the numerical reconciliation.
The following is an example of a reconciliation to the domestic tax rate.
Tax effect of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes
Effect of lower tax rates in country B
The following is an example of a reconciliation prepared by aggregating separate reconciliations for each national jurisdiction.
Under this method, the effect of differences between the reporting entity's own domestic tax rate and the domestic tax rate in other jurisdictions does not appear as a separate item in the reconciliation.
Tax at the domestic rates applicable to profits in the country concerned
Therefore, this Standard requires an entity to disclose the aggregate amount of the underlying temporary differences but does not require disclosure of the deferred tax liabilities.
Nevertheless, where practicable, entities are encouraged to disclose the amounts of the unrecognised deferred tax liabilities because financial statement users may find such information useful.
Paragraph 82A requires an entity to disclose the nature of the potential income tax consequences that would result from the payment of dividends to its shareholders.
An entity discloses the important features of the income tax systems and the factors that will affect the amount of the potential income tax consequences of dividends.
It would sometimes not be practicable to compute the total amount of the potential income tax consequences that would result from the payment of dividends to shareholders.
This may be the case, for example, where an entity has a large number of foreign subsidiaries.
However, even in such circumstances, some portions of the total amount may be easily determinable.
For example, in a consolidated group, a parent and some of its subsidiaries may have paid income taxes at a higher rate on undistributed profits and be aware of the amount that would be refunded on the payment of future dividends to shareholders from consolidated retained earnings.
In this case, that refundable amount is disclosed.
If applicable, the entity also discloses that there are additional potential income tax consequences not practicably determinable.
In the parent's separate financial statements, if any, the disclosure of the potential income tax consequences relates to the parent's retained earnings.
An entity required to provide the disclosures in paragraph 82A may also be required to provide disclosures related to temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates or interests in joint arrangements.
For example, an entity may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognised (see paragraph 81(f)).
Contingent liabilities and contingent assets may arise, for example, from unresolved disputes with the taxation authorities.
If earlier adoption affects the financial statements, an entity shall disclose that fact.
Other tax benefits recognised shall be recognised in profit or loss (or, if this Standard so requires, outside profit or loss).
However, on initial application of the amendment, the change in the opening equity of the earliest comparative period may be recognised in opening retained earnings (or in another component of equity, as appropriate), without allocating the change between opening retained earnings and other components of equity.
If an entity applies this relief, it shall disclose that fact.
When an entity first applies those amendments, it shall apply them to the income tax consequences of dividends recognised on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period.
Instruments, or components of instruments, that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation
Reclassification of puttable instruments and instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation
No contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset
Interest, dividends, losses and gains
Offsetting a financial asset and a financial liability
It applies to the classification of financial instruments, from the perspective of the issuer, into financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments; the classification of related interest, dividends, losses and gains; and the circumstances in which financial assets and financial liabilities should be offset.
Entities shall also apply this Standard to all derivatives linked to interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures.
However, these instruments are subject to all other requirements of this Standard.
Furthermore, this Standard applies to derivatives that are embedded in these instruments (see IFRS 9).
when the ability to settle net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, is not explicit in the terms of the contract, but the entity has a practice of settling similar contracts net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments (whether with the counterparty, by entering into offsetting contracts or by selling the contract before its exercise or lapse);
A contract to which (b) or (c) applies is not entered into for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the non-financial item in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements, and, accordingly, is within the scope of this Standard.
A financial asset is any asset that is
an equity instrument of another entity;
to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity; or
a contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments and is
a non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entity's own equity instruments; or
a derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity's own equity instruments.
A financial liability is any liability that is
a non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to deliver a variable number of the entity's own equity instruments; or
For this purpose, rights, options or warrants to acquire a fixed number of the entity's own equity instruments for a fixed amount of any currency are equity instruments if the entity offers the rights, options or warrants pro rata to all of its existing owners of the same class of its own non-derivative equity instruments.
As an exception, an instrument that meets the definition of a financial liability is classified as an equity instrument if it has all the features and meets the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
A puttable instrument is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset or is automatically put back to the issuer on the occurrence of an uncertain future event or the death or retirement of the instrument holder.
Contracts, and thus financial instruments, may take a variety of forms and need not be in writing.
to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the issuer.
a derivative that will be settled only by the issuer exchanging a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
Also, for these purposes the issuer's own equity instruments do not include instruments that have all the features and meet the conditions described in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D, or instruments that are contracts for the future receipt or delivery of the issuer's own equity instruments.
A puttable financial instrument includes a contractual obligation for the issuer to repurchase or redeem that instrument for cash or another financial asset on exercise of the put.
As an exception to the definition of a financial liability, an instrument that includes such an obligation is classified as an equity instrument if it has all the following features
The entity's net assets are those assets that remain after deducting all other claims on its assets.
dividing the entity's net assets on liquidation into units of equal amount; and
multiplying that amount by the number of the units held by the financial instrument holder.
To be in such a class the instrument
has no priority over other claims to the assets of the entity on liquidation, and
does not need to be converted into another instrument before it is in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments.
For example, they must all be puttable, and the formula or other method used to calculate the repurchase or redemption price is the same for all instruments in that class.
For an instrument to be classified as an equity instrument, in addition to the instrument having all the above features, the issuer must have no other financial instrument or contract that has
the effect of substantially restricting or fixing the residual return to the puttable instrument holders.
For the purposes of applying this condition, the entity shall not consider non-financial contracts with a holder of an instrument described in paragraph 16A that have contractual terms and conditions that are similar to the contractual terms and conditions of an equivalent contract that might occur between a non-instrument holder and the issuing entity.
If the entity cannot determine that this condition is met, it shall not classify the puttable instrument as an equity instrument.
Some financial instruments include a contractual obligation for the issuing entity to deliver to another entity a pro rata share of its net assets only on liquidation.
The obligation arises because liquidation either is certain to occur and outside the control of the entity (for example, a limited life entity) or is uncertain to occur but is at the option of the instrument holder.
dividing the net assets of the entity on liquidation into units of equal amount; and
the effect of substantially restricting or fixing the residual return to the instrument holders.
If the entity cannot determine that this condition is met, it shall not classify the instrument as an equity instrument.
An entity shall reclassify a financial instrument from the date when the instrument ceases to have all the features or meet all the conditions set out in those paragraphs.
For example, if an entity redeems all its issued non-puttable instruments and any puttable instruments that remain outstanding have all the features and meet all the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B, the entity shall reclassify the puttable instruments as equity instruments from the date when it redeems the non-puttable instruments.
An entity shall account as follows for the reclassification of an instrument in accordance with paragraph 16E
The financial liability shall be measured at the instrument's fair value at the date of reclassification.
The entity shall recognise in equity any difference between the carrying value of the equity instrument and the fair value of the financial liability at the date of reclassification.
An equity instrument shall be measured at the carrying value of the financial liability at the date of reclassification.
No contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset (paragraph 16(a))
Substance and legal form are commonly consistent, but not always.
Some financial instruments take the legal form of equity but are liabilities in substance and others may combine features associated with equity instruments and features associated with financial liabilities.
a preference share that provides for mandatory redemption by the issuer for a fixed or determinable amount at a fixed or determinable future date, or gives the holder the right to require the issuer to redeem the instrument at or after a particular date for a fixed or determinable amount, is a financial liability.
For example, open-ended mutual funds, unit trusts, partnerships and some co-operative entities may provide their unitholders or members with a right to redeem their interests in the issuer at any time for cash, which results in the unitholders' or members' interests being classified as financial liabilities, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.
However, classification as a financial liability does not preclude the use of descriptors such as 'net asset value attributable to unitholders' and 'change in net asset value attributable to unitholders' in the financial statements of an entity that has no contributed equity (such as some mutual funds and unit trusts, see Illustrative Example 7) or the use of additional disclosure to show that total members' interests comprise items such as reserves that meet the definition of equity and puttable instruments that do not (see Illustrative Example 8).
a restriction on the ability of an entity to satisfy a contractual obligation, such as lack of access to foreign currency or the need to obtain approval for payment from a regulatory authority, does not negate the entity's contractual obligation or the holder's contractual right under the instrument.
a contractual obligation that is conditional on a counterparty exercising its right to redeem is a financial liability because the entity does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset.
a financial instrument may contain a non-financial obligation that must be settled if, and only if, the entity fails to make distributions or to redeem the instrument.
If the entity can avoid a transfer of cash or another financial asset only by settling the non-financial obligation, the financial instrument is a financial liability.
a financial instrument is a financial liability if it provides that on settlement the entity will deliver either
cash or another financial asset; or
its own shares whose value is determined to exceed substantially the value of the cash or other financial asset.
Although the entity does not have an explicit contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset, the value of the share settlement alternative is such that the entity will settle in cash.
An entity may have a contractual right or obligation to receive or deliver a number of its own shares or other equity instruments that varies so that the fair value of the entity's own equity instruments to be received or delivered equals the amount of the contractual right or obligation.
Such a contractual right or obligation may be for a fixed amount or an amount that fluctuates in part or in full in response to changes in a variable other than the market price of the entity's own equity instruments (eg an interest rate, a commodity price or a financial instrument price).
Such a contract is a financial liability of the entity even though the entity must or can settle it by delivering its own equity instruments.
It is not an equity instrument because the entity uses a variable number of its own equity instruments as a means to settle the contract.
Accordingly, the contract does not evidence a residual interest in the entity's assets after deducting all of its liabilities.
For example, an issued share option that gives the counterparty a right to buy a fixed number of the entity's shares for a fixed price or for a fixed stated principal amount of a bond is an equity instrument.
Changes in the fair value of a contract arising from variations in market interest rates that do not affect the amount of cash or other financial assets to be paid or received, or the number of equity instruments to be received or delivered, on settlement of the contract do not preclude the contract from being an equity instrument.
Any consideration received (such as the premium received for a written option or warrant on the entity's own shares) is added directly to equity.
Any consideration paid (such as the premium paid for a purchased option) is deducted directly from equity.
Changes in the fair value of an equity instrument are not recognised in the financial statements.
This includes a contract that will be settled by the entity receiving or delivering a fixed number of such instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset.
This is the case even if the contract itself is an equity instrument.
The financial liability is recognised initially at the present value of the redemption amount, and is reclassified from equity.
If the contract expires without delivery, the carrying amount of the financial liability is reclassified to equity.
The issuer of such an instrument does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset (or otherwise to settle it in such a way that it would be a financial liability).
Therefore, it is a financial liability of the issuer unless
the part of the contingent settlement provision that could require settlement in cash or another financial asset (or otherwise in such a way that it would be a financial liability) is not genuine;
the instrument has all the features and meets the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B.
Such contracts are financial assets or financial liabilities and not equity instruments.
For example, a bond or similar instrument convertible by the holder into a fixed number of ordinary shares of the entity is a compound financial instrument.
The economic effect of issuing such an instrument is substantially the same as issuing simultaneously a debt instrument with an early settlement provision and warrants to purchase ordinary shares, or issuing a debt instrument with detachable share purchase warrants.
Accordingly, in all cases, the entity presents the liability and equity components separately in its statement of financial position.
Holders may not always act in the way that might be expected because, for example, the tax consequences resulting from conversion may differ among holders.
Furthermore, the likelihood of conversion will change from time to time.
The entity's contractual obligation to make future payments remains outstanding until it is extinguished through conversion, maturity of the instrument or some other transaction.
Equity instruments are instruments that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
Therefore, when the initial carrying amount of a compound financial instrument is allocated to its equity and liability components, the equity component is assigned the residual amount after deducting from the fair value of the instrument as a whole the amount separately determined for the liability component.
The value of any derivative features (such as a call option) embedded in the compound financial instrument other than the equity component (such as an equity conversion option) is included in the liability component.
The sum of the carrying amounts assigned to the liability and equity components on initial recognition is always equal to the fair value that would be ascribed to the instrument as a whole.
No gain or loss arises from initially recognising the components of the instrument separately.
The carrying amount of the equity instrument represented by the option to convert the instrument into ordinary shares is then determined by deducting the fair value of the financial liability from the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole.
No gain or loss shall be recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of an entity's own equity instruments.
Such treasury shares may be acquired and held by the entity or by other members of the consolidated group.
Consideration paid or received shall be recognised directly in equity.
Distributions to holders of an equity instrument shall be recognised by the entity directly in equity.
Transaction costs of an equity transaction shall be accounted for as a deduction from equity.
Thus, dividend payments on shares wholly recognised as liabilities are recognised as expenses in the same way as interest on a bond.
Similarly, gains and losses associated with redemptions or refinancings of financial liabilities are recognised in profit or loss, whereas redemptions or refinancings of equity instruments are recognised as changes in equity.
Those costs might include registration and other regulatory fees, amounts paid to legal, accounting and other professional advisers, printing costs and stamp duties.
The transaction costs of an equity transaction are accounted for as a deduction from equity to the extent that they are incremental costs directly attributable to the equity transaction that otherwise would have been avoided.
The costs of an equity transaction that is abandoned are recognised as an expense.
When an entity has the right to receive or pay a single net amount and intends to do so, it has, in effect, only a single financial asset or financial liability.
In other circumstances, financial assets and financial liabilities are presented separately from each other consistently with their characteristics as resources or obligations of the entity.
Although offsetting does not give rise to recognition of a gain or loss, the derecognition of a financial instrument not only results in the removal of the previously recognised item from the statement of financial position but also may result in recognition of a gain or loss.
However, the existence of the right, by itself, is not a sufficient basis for offsetting.
In the absence of an intention to exercise the right or to settle simultaneously, the amount and timing of an entity's future cash flows are not affected.
When an entity intends to exercise the right or to settle simultaneously, presentation of the asset and liability on a net basis reflects more appropriately the amounts and timing of the expected future cash flows, as well as the risks to which those cash flows are exposed.
In these circumstances the cash flows are, in effect, equivalent to a single net amount and there is no exposure to credit or liquidity risk.
Such risk exposures may be significant even though relatively brief.
Accordingly, realisation of a financial asset and settlement of a financial liability are treated as simultaneous only when the transactions occur at the same moment.
financial assets and financial liabilities arise from financial instruments having the same primary risk exposure (for example, assets and liabilities within a portfolio of forward contracts or other derivative instruments) but involve different counterparties;
financial or other assets are pledged as collateral for non-recourse financial liabilities;
These arrangements are commonly used by financial institutions to provide protection against loss in the event of bankruptcy or other circumstances that result in a counterparty being unable to meet its obligations.
A master netting arrangement commonly creates a right of set-off that becomes enforceable and affects the realisation or settlement of individual financial assets and financial liabilities only following a specified event of default or in other circumstances not expected to arise in the normal course of business.
When applying the amendments described in paragraph 96A, an entity is required to split a compound financial instrument with an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation into separate liability and equity components.
The other component would represent the original equity component.
An entity shall provide the disclosures required by this amendment retrospectively.
This Application Guidance explains the application of particular aspects of the Standard.
The Standard does not deal with the recognition or measurement of financial instruments.
Currency (cash) is a financial asset because it represents the medium of exchange and is therefore the basis on which all transactions are measured and recognised in financial statements.
A deposit of cash with a bank or similar financial institution is a financial asset because it represents the contractual right of the depositor to obtain cash from the institution or to draw a cheque or similar instrument against the balance in favour of a creditor in payment of a financial liability.
Common examples of financial assets representing a contractual right to receive cash in the future and corresponding financial liabilities representing a contractual obligation to deliver cash in the future are
trade accounts receivable and payable;
Another type of financial instrument is one for which the economic benefit to be received or given up is a financial asset other than cash.
For example, a note payable in government bonds gives the holder the contractual right to receive and the issuer the contractual obligation to deliver government bonds, not cash.
The bonds are financial assets because they represent obligations of the issuing government to pay cash.
The note is, therefore, a financial asset of the note holder and a financial liability of the note issuer.
Perpetual' debt instruments (such as 'perpetual' bonds, debentures and capital notes) normally provide the holder with the contractual right to receive payments on account of interest at fixed dates extending into the indefinite future, either with no right to receive a return of principal or a right to a return of principal under terms that make it very unlikely or very far in the future.
The holder and issuer of the instrument have a financial asset and a financial liability, respectively.
A contractual right or contractual obligation to receive, deliver or exchange financial instruments is itself a financial instrument.
A chain of contractual rights or contractual obligations meets the definition of a financial instrument if it will ultimately lead to the receipt or payment of cash or to the acquisition or issue of an equity instrument.
A lease typically creates an entitlement of the lessor to receive, and an obligation of the lessee to pay, a stream of payments that are substantially the same as blended payments of principal and interest under a loan agreement.
The lessor accounts for its investment in the amount receivable under a finance lease rather than the underlying asset itself that is subject to the finance lease.
Accordingly, a lessor regards a finance lease as a financial instrument.
Under IFRS 16, a lessor does not recognise its entitlement to receive lease payments under an operating lease.
The lessor continues to account for the underlying asset itself rather than any amount receivable in the future under the contract.
Physical assets (such as inventories, property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and intangible assets (such as patents and trademarks) are not financial assets.
Control of such physical assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets creates an opportunity to generate an inflow of cash or another financial asset, but it does not give rise to a present right to receive cash or another financial asset.
Assets (such as prepaid expenses) for which the future economic benefit is the receipt of goods or services, rather than the right to receive cash or another financial asset, are not financial assets.
Similarly, items such as deferred revenue and most warranty obligations are not financial liabilities because the outflow of economic benefits associated with them is the delivery of goods and services rather than a contractual obligation to pay cash or another financial asset.
Liabilities or assets that are not contractual (such as income taxes that are created as a result of statutory requirements imposed by governments) are not financial liabilities or financial assets.
An entity's obligation to issue or purchase a fixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset is an equity instrument of the entity (except as stated in paragraph 22A).
However, if such a contract contains an obligation for the entity to pay cash or another financial asset (other than a contract classified as equity in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D), it also gives rise to a liability for the present value of the redemption amount (see paragraph AG27(a)).
An issuer of non-puttable ordinary shares assumes a liability when it formally acts to make a distribution and becomes legally obliged to the shareholders to do so.
This may be the case following the declaration of a dividend or when the entity is being wound up and any assets remaining after the satisfaction of liabilities become distributable to shareholders.
A purchased call option or other similar contract acquired by an entity that gives it the right to reacquire a fixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for delivering a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset is not a financial asset of the entity (except as stated in paragraph 22A).
Instead, any consideration paid for such a contract is deducted from equity.
The class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes (paragraphs 16A(b) and 16C(b))
An entity shall reassess the classification if there is a change in relevant circumstances.
For example, if the entity issues or redeems another financial instrument, this may affect whether the instrument in question is in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes.
For example, an instrument has a preferential right on liquidation if it entitles the holder to a fixed dividend on liquidation, in addition to a share of the entity's net assets, when other instruments in the subordinate class with a right to a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity do not have the same right on liquidation.
Total expected cash flows attributable to the instrument over the life of the instrument (paragraph 16A(e))
AG14E The total expected cash flows of the instrument over the life of the instrument must be substantially based on the profit or loss, change in the recognised net assets or fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the entity over the life of the instrument.
Profit or loss and the change in the recognised net assets shall be measured in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Transactions entered into by an instrument holder other than as owner of the entity (paragraphs 16A and 16C)
For example, an instrument holder may also be an employee of the entity.
Only the cash flows and the contractual terms and conditions of the instrument that relate to the instrument holder as an owner of the entity shall be considered when assessing whether the instrument should be classified as equity under paragraph 16A or paragraph 16C.
Some general partners may provide a guarantee to the entity and may be remunerated for providing that guarantee.
In such situations, the guarantee and the associated cash flows relate to the instrument holders in their role as guarantors and not in their roles as owners of the entity.
Therefore, such a guarantee and the associated cash flows would not result in the general partners being considered subordinate to the limited partners, and would be disregarded when assessing whether the contractual terms of the limited partnership instruments and the general partnership instruments are identical.
Such arrangements are transactions with instrument holders in their role as non-owners and should not be considered when assessing the features listed in paragraph 16A or paragraph 16C.
However, profit or loss sharing arrangements that allocate profit or loss to instrument holders based on the nominal amount of their instruments relative to others in the class represent transactions with the instrument holders in their roles as owners and should be considered when assessing the features listed in paragraph 16A or paragraph 16C.
AG14J A condition for classifying as equity a financial instrument that otherwise meets the criteria in paragraph 16A or paragraph 16C is that the entity has no other financial instrument or contract that has (a) total cash flows based substantially on the profit or loss, the change in the recognised net assets or the change in the fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the entity and (b) the effect of substantially restricting or fixing the residual return.
instruments with total cash flows substantially based on specific assets of the entity.
instruments with total cash flows based on a percentage of revenue.
contracts designed to reward individual employees for services rendered to the entity.
contracts requiring the payment of an insignificant percentage of profit for services rendered or goods provided.
Derivative financial instruments meet the definition of a financial instrument and, accordingly, are within the scope of this Standard.
Derivative financial instruments create rights and obligations that have the effect of transferring between the parties to the instrument one or more of the financial risks inherent in an underlying primary financial instrument.
Some instruments embody both a right and an obligation to make an exchange.
Because the terms of the exchange are determined on inception of the derivative instrument, as prices in financial markets change those terms may become either favourable or unfavourable.
A put or call option to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities (ie financial instruments other than an entity's own equity instruments) gives the holder a right to obtain potential future economic benefits associated with changes in the fair value of the financial instrument underlying the contract.
Conversely, the writer of an option assumes an obligation to forgo potential future economic benefits or bear potential losses of economic benefits associated with changes in the fair value of the underlying financial instrument.
The contractual right of the holder and obligation of the writer meet the definition of a financial asset and a financial liability, respectively.
The financial instrument underlying an option contract may be any financial asset, including shares in other entities and interest-bearing instruments.
An option may require the writer to issue a debt instrument, rather than transfer a financial asset, but the instrument underlying the option would constitute a financial asset of the holder if the option were exercised.
The option-holder's right to exchange the financial asset under potentially favourable conditions and the writer's obligation to exchange the financial asset under potentially unfavourable conditions are distinct from the underlying financial asset to be exchanged upon exercise of the option.
The nature of the holder's right and of the writer's obligation are not affected by the likelihood that the option will be exercised.
As with options, these contractual rights and obligations constitute financial assets and financial liabilities separate and distinct from the underlying financial instruments (the bonds and cash to be exchanged).
Both parties to a forward contract have an obligation to perform at the agreed time, whereas performance under an option contract occurs only if and when the holder of the option chooses to exercise it.
Futures contracts are another variation of forward contracts, differing primarily in that the contracts are standardised and traded on an exchange.
For example, contracts that provide for settlement only by the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item (eg an option, futures or forward contract on silver) are not financial instruments.
Many commodity contracts are of this type.
Some are standardised in form and traded on organised markets in much the same fashion as some derivative financial instruments.
For example, a commodity futures contract may be bought and sold readily for cash because it is listed for trading on an exchange and may change hands many times.
However, the parties buying and selling the contract are, in effect, trading the underlying commodity.
The ability to buy or sell a commodity contract for cash, the ease with which it may be bought or sold and the possibility of negotiating a cash settlement of the obligation to receive or deliver the commodity do not alter the fundamental character of the contract in a way that creates a financial instrument.
Such is the case with the purchase or sale of goods on trade credit.
Some contracts are commodity-linked, but do not involve settlement through the physical receipt or delivery of a commodity.
They specify settlement through cash payments that are determined according to a formula in the contract, rather than through payment of fixed amounts.
For example, the principal amount of a bond may be calculated by applying the market price of oil prevailing at the maturity of the bond to a fixed quantity of oil.
The principal is indexed by reference to a commodity price, but is settled only in cash.
Such a contract constitutes a financial instrument.
The definition of a financial instrument also encompasses a contract that gives rise to a non-financial asset or non-financial liability in addition to a financial asset or financial liability.
For example, an oil-linked bond may give the holder the right to receive a stream of fixed periodic interest payments and a fixed amount of cash on maturity, with the option to exchange the principal amount for a fixed quantity of oil.
The desirability of exercising this option will vary from time to time depending on the fair value of oil relative to the exchange ratio of cash for oil (the exchange price) inherent in the bond.
The intentions of the bondholder concerning the exercise of the option do not affect the substance of the component assets.
The financial asset of the holder and the financial liability of the issuer make the bond a financial instrument, regardless of the other types of assets and liabilities also created.
An option of the issuer to redeem the shares for cash does not satisfy the definition of a financial liability because the issuer does not have a present obligation to transfer financial assets to the shareholders.
In this case, redemption of the shares is solely at the discretion of the issuer.
An obligation may arise, however, when the issuer of the shares exercises its option, usually by formally notifying the shareholders of an intention to redeem the shares.
The following examples illustrate how to classify different types of contracts on an entity's own equity instruments
Accordingly, any consideration received or paid for such a contract is added directly to or deducted directly from equity.
However, if the contract requires the entity to purchase (redeem) its own shares for cash or another financial asset at a fixed or determinable date or on demand, the entity also recognises a financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount (with the exception of instruments that have all the features and meet the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D).
An example is a written option to buy gold that, if exercised, is settled net in the entity's own instruments by the entity delivering as many of those instruments as are equal to the value of the option contract.
Such a contract is a financial asset or financial liability even if the underlying variable is the entity's own share price rather than gold.
Similarly, a contract that will be settled in a fixed number of the entity's own shares, but the rights attaching to those shares will be varied so that the settlement value equals a fixed amount or an amount based on changes in an underlying variable, is a financial asset or a financial liability.
Contingent settlement provisions (paragraph 25)
Thus, a contract that requires settlement in cash or a variable number of the entity's own shares only on the occurrence of an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely to occur is an equity instrument.
Similarly, settlement in a fixed number of an entity's own shares may be contractually precluded in circumstances that are outside the control of the entity, but if these circumstances have no genuine possibility of occurring, classification as an equity instrument is appropriate.
Treatment in consolidated financial statements
When classifying a financial instrument (or a component of it) in consolidated financial statements, an entity considers all terms and conditions agreed between members of the group and the holders of the instrument in determining whether the group as a whole has an obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset in respect of the instrument or to settle it in a manner that results in liability classification.
When a subsidiary in a group issues a financial instrument and a parent or other group entity agrees additional terms directly with the holders of the instrument (eg a guarantee), the group may not have discretion over distributions or redemption.
Although the subsidiary may appropriately classify the instrument without regard to these additional terms in its individual financial statements, the effect of other agreements between members of the group and the holders of the instrument is considered in order to ensure that consolidated financial statements reflect the contracts and transactions entered into by the group as a whole.
To the extent that there is such an obligation or settlement provision, the instrument (or the component of it that is subject to the obligation) is classified as a financial liability in consolidated financial statements.
AG29A Some types of instruments that impose a contractual obligation on the entity are classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.
Classification in accordance with those paragraphs is an exception to the principles otherwise applied in this Standard to the classification of an instrument.
This exception is not extended to the classification of non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements.
A common form of compound financial instrument is a debt instrument with an embedded conversion option, such as a bond convertible into ordinary shares of the issuer, and without any other embedded derivative features.
This option has value on initial recognition even when it is out of the money.
On conversion of a convertible instrument at maturity, the entity derecognises the liability component and recognises it as equity.
There is no gain or loss on conversion at maturity.
When an entity extinguishes a convertible instrument before maturity through an early redemption or repurchase in which the original conversion privileges are unchanged, the entity allocates the consideration paid and any transaction costs for the repurchase or redemption to the liability and equity components of the instrument at the date of the transaction.
Once the allocation of the consideration is made, any resulting gain or loss is treated in accordance with accounting principles applicable to the related component, as follows
the amount of consideration relating to the equity component is recognised in equity.
An entity may amend the terms of a convertible instrument to induce early conversion, for example by offering a more favourable conversion ratio or paying other additional consideration in the event of conversion before a specified date.
The difference, at the date the terms are amended, between the fair value of the consideration the holder receives on conversion of the instrument under the revised terms and the fair value of the consideration the holder would have received under the original terms is recognised as a loss in profit or loss.
Such an instrument is a compound financial instrument, with the liability component being the present value of the redemption amount.
The unwinding of the discount on this component is recognised in profit or loss and classified as interest expense.
Any dividends paid relate to the equity component and, accordingly, are recognised as a distribution of profit or loss.
A similar treatment would apply if the redemption was not mandatory but at the option of the holder, or if the share was mandatorily convertible into a variable number of ordinary shares calculated to equal a fixed amount or an amount based on changes in an underlying variable (eg commodity).
However, if any unpaid dividends are added to the redemption amount, the entire instrument is a liability.
In such a case, any dividends are classified as interest expense.
Criterion that an entity 'currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts' (paragraph 42(a))
This means that the right of set-off
must not be contingent on a future event; and
must be legally enforceable in all of the following circumstances
the normal course of business;
Consequently, it cannot be assumed that the right of set-off is automatically available outside of the normal course of business.
For example, the bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a jurisdiction may prohibit, or restrict, the right of set-off in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency in some circumstances.
The laws applicable to the relationships between the parties (for example, contractual provisions, the laws governing the contract, or the default, insolvency or bankruptcy laws applicable to the parties) need to be considered to ascertain whether the right of set-off is enforceable in the normal course of business, in an event of default, and in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy, of the entity and all of the counterparties (as specified in paragraph AG38B(b)).
Criterion that an entity 'intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously' (paragraph 42(b))
To meet the criterion in paragraph 42(b) an entity must intend either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Although the entity may have a right to settle net, it may still realise the asset and settle the liability separately.
If an entity can settle amounts in a manner such that the outcome is, in effect, equivalent to net settlement, the entity will meet the net settlement criterion in paragraph 42(b).
This will occur if, and only if, the gross settlement mechanism has features that eliminate or result in insignificant credit and liquidity risk, and that will process receivables and payables in a single settlement process or cycle.
For example, a gross settlement system that has all of the following characteristics would meet the net settlement criterion in paragraph 42(b)
financial assets and financial liabilities eligible for set-off are submitted at the same point in time for processing;
once the financial assets and financial liabilities are submitted for processing, the parties are committed to fulfil the settlement obligation;
any transactions that fail, as outlined in (d), will be re-entered for processing until they are settled;
settlement is carried out through the same settlement institution (for example, a settlement bank, a central bank or a central securities depository); and
The Standard does not provide special treatment for so-called 'synthetic instruments', which are groups of separate financial instruments acquired and held to emulate the characteristics of another instrument.
For example, a floating rate long-term debt combined with an interest rate swap that involves receiving floating payments and making fixed payments synthesises a fixed rate long-term debt.
Each financial instrument is exposed to risks that may differ from the risks to which other financial instruments are exposed.
Link between power and returns
INVESTMENT ENTITIES: EXCEPTION TO CONSOLIDATION
defines the principle of control, and establishes control as the basis for consolidation;
sets out the accounting requirements for the preparation of consolidated financial statements; and
defines an investment entity and sets out an exception to consolidating particular subsidiaries of an investment entity.
This IFRS applies to all entities, except as follows
a parent need not present consolidated financial statements if it meets all the following conditions
it is a wholly-owned subsidiary or is a partially-owned subsidiary of another entity and all its other owners, including those not otherwise entitled to vote, have been informed about, and do not object to, the parent not presenting consolidated financial statements;
its debt or equity instruments are not traded in a public market (a domestic or foreign stock exchange or an over-the-counter market, including local and regional markets);
(iv) its ultimate or any intermediate parent produces financial statements that are available for public use and comply with IFRSs, in which subsidiaries are consolidated or are measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with this IFRS.
In such cases, because no investor can direct the activities without the co-operation of the others, no investor individually controls the investee.
Sometimes assessing power is straightforward, such as when power over an investee is obtained directly and solely from the voting rights granted by equity instruments such as shares, and can be assessed by considering the voting rights from those shareholdings.
Evidence that the investor has been directing relevant activities can help determine whether the investor has power, but such evidence is not, in itself, conclusive in determining whether the investor has power over an investee.
However, an investor that holds only protective rights does not have power over an investee (see paragraphs B26–B28), and consequently does not control the investee.
The investor's returns can be only positive, only negative or both positive and negative.
For example, holders of non-controlling interests can share in the profits or distributions of an investee.
An investor that is an agent in accordance with paragraphs B58–B72 does not control an investee when it exercises decision-making rights delegated to it.
recognises any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value when control is lost and subsequently accounts for it and for any amounts owed by or to the former subsidiary in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
recognises the gain or loss associated with the loss of control attributable to the former controlling interest.
Determining whether an entity is an investment entity
measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
Paragraphs B85A–B85M provide related application guidance.
it has ownership interests in the form of equity or similar interests (see paragraphs B85V–B85W).
The absence of any of these typical characteristics does not necessarily disqualify an entity from being classified as an investment entity.
Investment entities: exception to consolidation
The financial statements of a group in which the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent and its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity.
A parent and its subsidiaries.
(c) measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
Equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.
Existing rights that give the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
Rights designed to protect the interest of the party holding those rights without giving that party power over the entity to which those rights relate.
For the purpose of this IFRS, relevant activities are activities of the investee that significantly affect the investee's returns.
Rights to deprive the decision maker of its decision-making authority.
An entity that is controlled by another entity.
To determine whether it controls an investee an investor shall assess whether it has all the following
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns.
Consideration of the following factors may assist in making that determination
the purpose and design of the investee (see paragraphs B5–B8);
what the relevant activities are and how decisions about those activities are made (see paragraphs B11–B13);
whether the rights of the investor give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities (see paragraphs B14–B54);
whether the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee (see paragraphs B55–B57); and
whether the investor has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns (see paragraphs B58–B72).
When assessing control of an investee, an investor shall consider the nature of its relationship with other parties (see paragraphs B73–B75).
When assessing control of an investee, an investor shall consider the purpose and design of the investee in order to identify the relevant activities, how decisions about the relevant activities are made, who has the current ability to direct those activities and who receives returns from those activities.
When an investee's purpose and design are considered, it may be clear that an investee is controlled by means of equity instruments that give the holder proportionate voting rights, such as ordinary shares in the investee.
In this case, in the absence of any additional arrangements that alter decision-making, the assessment of control focuses on which party, if any, is able to exercise voting rights sufficient to determine the investee's operating and financing policies (see paragraphs B34–B50).
An investee may be designed so that voting rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the investee, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
In such cases, an investor's consideration of the purpose and design of the investee shall also include consideration of the risks to which the investee was designed to be exposed, the risks it was designed to pass on to the parties involved with the investee and whether the investor is exposed to some or all of those risks.
Consideration of the risks includes not only the downside risk, but also the potential for upside.
To have power over an investee, an investor must have existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
For the purpose of assessing power, only substantive rights and rights that are not protective shall be considered (see paragraphs B22–B28).
The determination about whether an investor has power depends on the relevant activities, the way decisions about the relevant activities are made and the rights the investor and other parties have in relation to the investee.
Relevant activities and direction of relevant activities
For many investees, a range of operating and financing activities significantly affect their returns.
Examples of activities that, depending on the circumstances, can be relevant activities include, but are not limited to
selling and purchasing of goods or services;
managing financial assets during their life (including upon default);
selecting, acquiring or disposing of assets;
researching and developing new products or processes; and
determining a funding structure or obtaining funding.
Examples of decisions about relevant activities include but are not limited to
establishing operating and capital decisions of the investee, including budgets; and
appointing and remunerating an investee's key management personnel or service providers and terminating their services or employment.
The investors shall reconsider this assessment over time if relevant facts or circumstances change.
Accordingly, each investor needs to consider whether developing and obtaining regulatory approval or the manufacturing and marketing of the medical product is the activity that most significantly affects the investee's returns and whether it is able to direct that activity.
In determining which investor has power, the investors would consider
(a) the purpose and design of the investee;
(c) the effect on the investee's returns resulting from each investor's decision-making authority with respect to the factors in (b); and
In this particular example, the investors would also consider
(e) the uncertainty of, and effort required in, obtaining regulatory approval (considering the investor's record of successfully developing and obtaining regulatory approval of medical products); and
(f) which investor controls the medical product once the development phase is successful.
An investment vehicle (the investee) is created and financed with a debt instrument held by an investor (the debt investor) and equity instruments held by a number of other investors.
The investee uses its proceeds to purchase a portfolio of financial assets, exposing the investee to the credit risk associated with the possible default of principal and interest payments of the assets.
The returns of the investee are significantly affected by the management of the investee's asset portfolio, which includes decisions about the selection, acquisition and disposal of the assets within portfolio guidelines and the management upon default of any portfolio assets.
All those activities are managed by the asset manager until defaults reach a specified proportion of the portfolio value (ie when the value of the portfolio is such that the equity tranche of the investee has been consumed).
Managing the investee's asset portfolio is the relevant activity of the investee.
The asset manager and the debt investor each need to determine whether they are able to direct the activities that most significantly affect the investee's returns, including considering the purpose and design of the investee as well as each party's exposure to variability of returns.
To have power over an investee, an investor must have existing rights that give the investor the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
The rights that may give an investor power can differ between investees.
Examples of rights that, either individually or in combination, can give an investor power include but are not limited to
rights in the form of voting rights (or potential voting rights) of an investee (see paragraphs B34–B50);
rights to appoint, reassign or remove members of an investee's key management personnel who have the ability to direct the relevant activities;
rights to appoint or remove another entity that directs the relevant activities;
rights to direct the investee to enter into, or veto any changes to, transactions for the benefit of the investor; and
other rights (such as decision-making rights specified in a management contract) that give the holder the ability to direct the relevant activities.
Generally, when an investee has a range of operating and financing activities that significantly affect the investee's returns and when substantive decision-making with respect to these activities is required continuously, it will be voting or similar rights that give an investor power, either individually or in combination with other arrangements.
In some circumstances it may be difficult to determine whether an investor's rights are sufficient to give it power over an investee.
In such cases, to enable the assessment of power to be made, the investor shall consider evidence of whether it has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities unilaterally.
Sometimes there will be indications that the investor has a special relationship with the investee, which suggests that the investor has more than a passive interest in the investee.
The existence of any individual indicator, or a particular combination of indicators, does not necessarily mean that the power criterion is met.
However, having more than a passive interest in the investee may indicate that the investor has other related rights sufficient to give it power or provide evidence of existing power over an investee.
For example, the following suggests that the investor has more than a passive interest in the investee and, in combination with other rights, may indicate power
(iii) The investee depends on the investor for critical services, technology, supplies or raw materials.
The greater an investor's exposure, or rights, to variability of returns from its involvement with an investee, the greater is the incentive for the investor to obtain rights sufficient to give it power.
Therefore, having a large exposure to variability of returns is an indicator that the investor may have power.
However, the extent of the investor's exposure does not, in itself, determine whether an investor has power over the investee.
When the factors set out in paragraph B18 and the indicators set out in paragraphs B19 and B20 are considered together with an investor's rights, greater weight shall be given to the evidence of power described in paragraph B18.
An investor, in assessing whether it has power, considers only substantive rights relating to an investee (held by the investor and others).
For a right to be substantive, the holder must have the practical ability to exercise that right.
Determining whether rights are substantive requires judgement, taking into account all facts and circumstances.
Examples of such barriers include but are not limited to
the inability of the holder of the rights to obtain the information necessary to exercise its rights.
(vii) legal or regulatory requirements that prevent the holder from exercising its rights (eg where a foreign investor is prohibited from exercising its rights).
The lack of such a mechanism is an indicator that the rights may not be substantive.
The more parties that are required to agree to exercise the rights, the less likely it is that those rights are substantive.
However, a board of directors whose members are independent of the decision maker may serve as a mechanism for numerous investors to act collectively in exercising their rights.
Therefore, removal rights exercisable by an independent board of directors are more likely to be substantive than if the same rights were exercisable individually by a large number of investors.
For example, the holder of potential voting rights in an investee (see paragraphs B47–B50) shall consider the exercise or conversion price of the instrument.
The terms and conditions of potential voting rights are more likely to be substantive when the instrument is in the money or the investor would benefit for other reasons (eg by realising synergies between the investor and the investee) from the exercise or conversion of the instrument.
To be substantive, rights also need to be exercisable when decisions about the direction of the relevant activities need to be made.
Policies over the relevant activities can be changed only at special or scheduled shareholders' meetings.
This includes the approval of material sales of assets as well as the making or disposing of significant investments.
Each example is considered in isolation.
An investor holds a majority of the voting rights in the investee.
The investor's voting rights are substantive because the investor is able to make decisions about the direction of the relevant activities when they need to be made.
An investor is party to a forward contract to acquire the majority of shares in the investee.
The investor's forward contract is a substantive right that gives the investor the current ability to direct the relevant activities even before the forward contract is settled.
The same conclusion would be reached as in example 3B.
An investor is party to a forward contract to acquire the majority of shares in the investee, with no other related rights over the investee.
In contrast to the examples above, the investor does not have the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
The existing shareholders have the current ability to direct the relevant activities because they can change the existing policies over the relevant activities before the forward contract is settled.
Substantive rights exercisable by other parties can prevent an investor from controlling the investee to which those rights relate.
Such substantive rights do not require the holders to have the ability to initiate decisions.
As long as the rights are not merely protective (see paragraphs B26–B28), substantive rights held by other parties may prevent the investor from controlling the investee even if the rights give the holders only the current ability to approve or block decisions that relate to the relevant activities.
In evaluating whether rights give an investor power over an investee, the investor shall assess whether its rights, and rights held by others, are protective rights.
Protective rights relate to fundamental changes to the activities of an investee or apply in exceptional circumstances.
However, not all rights that apply in exceptional circumstances or are contingent on events are protective (see paragraphs B13 and B53).
Examples of protective rights include but are not limited to
a lender's right to restrict a borrower from undertaking activities that could significantly change the credit risk of the borrower to the detriment of the lender.
the right of a party holding a non-controlling interest in an investee to approve capital expenditure greater than that required in the ordinary course of business, or to approve the issue of equity or debt instruments.
the right of a lender to seize the assets of a borrower if the borrower fails to meet specified loan repayment conditions.
Franchise agreements typically give franchisors some decision-making rights with respect to the operations of the franchisee.
Generally, franchisors' rights do not restrict the ability of parties other than the franchisor to make decisions that have a significant effect on the franchisee's returns.
Nor do the rights of the franchisor in franchise agreements necessarily give the franchisor the current ability to direct the activities that significantly affect the franchisee's returns.
It is necessary to distinguish between having the current ability to make decisions that significantly affect the franchisee's returns and having the ability to make decisions that protect the franchise brand.
The franchisor does not have power over the franchisee if other parties have existing rights that give them the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the franchisee.
By entering into the franchise agreement the franchisee has made a unilateral decision to operate its business in accordance with the terms of the franchise agreement, but for its own account.
Control over such fundamental decisions as the legal form of the franchisee and its funding structure may be determined by parties other than the franchisor and may significantly affect the returns of the franchisee.
The lower the level of financial support provided by the franchisor and the lower the franchisor's exposure to variability of returns from the franchisee the more likely it is that the franchisor has only protective rights.
Often an investor has the current ability, through voting or similar rights, to direct the relevant activities.
An investor considers the requirements in this section (paragraphs B35–B50) if the relevant activities of an investee are directed through voting rights.
Power with a majority of the voting rights
a majority of the members of the governing body that directs the relevant activities are appointed by a vote of the holder of the majority of the voting rights.
Majority of the voting rights but no power
If another entity has existing rights that provide that entity with the right to direct the relevant activities and that entity is not an agent of the investor, the investor does not have power over the investee.
An investor does not have power over an investee, even though the investor holds the majority of the voting rights in the investee, when those voting rights are not substantive.
Power without a majority of the voting rights
a contractual arrangement between the investor and other vote holders (see paragraph B39);
rights arising from other contractual arrangements (see paragraph B40);
the investor's voting rights (see paragraphs B41–B45);
Contractual arrangement with other vote holders
A contractual arrangement between an investor and other vote holders can give the investor the right to exercise voting rights sufficient to give the investor power, even if the investor does not have voting rights sufficient to give it power without the contractual arrangement.
However, a contractual arrangement might ensure that the investor can direct enough other vote holders on how to vote to enable the investor to make decisions about the relevant activities.
Rights from other contractual arrangements
Other decision-making rights, in combination with voting rights, can give an investor the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
For example, the rights specified in a contractual arrangement in combination with voting rights may be sufficient to give an investor the current ability to direct the manufacturing processes of an investee or to direct other operating or financing activities of an investee that significantly affect the investee's returns.
However, in the absence of any other rights, economic dependence of an investee on the investor (such as relations of a supplier with its main customer) does not lead to the investor having power over the investee.
An investor with less than a majority of the voting rights has rights that are sufficient to give it power when the investor has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities unilaterally.
When assessing whether an investor's voting rights are sufficient to give it power, an investor considers all facts and circumstances, including
the size of the investor's holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders, noting that
the more voting rights an investor holds, the more likely the investor is to have existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities;
the more voting rights an investor holds relative to other vote holders, the more likely the investor is to have existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities;
potential voting rights held by the investor, other vote holders or other parties (see paragraphs B47–B50);
rights arising from other contractual arrangements (see paragraph B40); and
any additional facts and circumstances that indicate the investor has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders' meetings.
When the direction of relevant activities is determined by majority vote and an investor holds significantly more voting rights than any other vote holder or organised group of vote holders, and the other shareholdings are widely dispersed, it may be clear, after considering the factors listed in paragraph B42(a)–(c) alone, that the investor has power over the investee.
None of the shareholders has any arrangements to consult any of the others or make collective decisions.
In this case, on the basis of the absolute size of its holding and the relative size of the other shareholdings, the investor concludes that it has a sufficiently dominant voting interest to meet the power criterion without the need to consider any other evidence of power.
A shareholder agreement grants investor A the right to appoint, remove and set the remuneration of management responsible for directing the relevant activities.
In this case, investor A concludes that the absolute size of the investor's holding and the relative size of the other shareholdings alone are not conclusive in determining whether the investor has rights sufficient to give it power.
However, investor A determines that its contractual right to appoint, remove and set the remuneration of management is sufficient to conclude that it has power over the investee.
The fact that investor A might not have exercised this right or the likelihood of investor A exercising its right to select, appoint or remove management shall not be considered when assessing whether investor A has power.
In other situations, it may be clear after considering the factors listed in paragraph B42(a)–(c) alone that an investor does not have power.
There are no other arrangements that affect decision-making.
In this case, the size of investor A's voting interest and its size relative to the other shareholdings are sufficient to conclude that investor A does not have power.
However, the factors listed in paragraph B42(a)–(c) alone may not be conclusive.
If an investor, having considered those factors, is unclear whether it has power, it shall consider additional facts and circumstances, such as whether other shareholders are passive in nature as demonstrated by voting patterns at previous shareholders' meetings.
This includes the assessment of the factors set out in paragraph B18 and the indicators in paragraphs B19 and B20.
The fewer voting rights the investor holds, and the fewer parties that would need to act together to outvote the investor, the more reliance would be placed on the additional facts and circumstances to assess whether the investor's rights are sufficient to give it power.
When the facts and circumstances in paragraphs B18–B20 are considered together with the investor's rights, greater weight shall be given to the evidence of power in paragraph B18 than to the indicators of power in paragraphs B19 and B20.
None of the shareholders has contractual arrangements to consult any of the others or make collective decisions.
In this case, the absolute size of the investor's holding and the relative size of the other shareholdings alone are not conclusive in determining whether the investor has rights sufficient to give it power over the investee.
Additional facts and circumstances that may provide evidence that the investor has, or does not have, power shall be considered.
None of the shareholders has arrangements to consult any of the others or make collective decisions.
In this case, the active participation of the other shareholders at recent shareholders' meetings indicates that the investor would not have the practical ability to direct the relevant activities unilaterally, regardless of whether the investor has directed the relevant activities because a sufficient number of other shareholders voted in the same way as the investor.
If it is not clear, having considered the factors listed in paragraph B42(a)–(d), that the investor has power, the investor does not control the investee.
When assessing control, an investor considers its potential voting rights as well as potential voting rights held by other parties, to determine whether it has power.
Potential voting rights are rights to obtain voting rights of an investee, such as those arising from convertible instruments or options, including forward contracts.
Those potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive (see paragraphs B22–B25).
When considering potential voting rights, an investor shall consider the purpose and design of the instrument, as well as the purpose and design of any other involvement the investor has with the investee.
This includes an assessment of the various terms and conditions of the instrument as well as the investor's apparent expectations, motives and reasons for agreeing to those terms and conditions.
If the investor also has voting or other decision-making rights relating to the investee's activities, the investor assesses whether those rights, in combination with potential voting rights, give the investor power.
Substantive potential voting rights alone, or in combination with other rights, can give an investor the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
Investor A has been exercising its votes and is actively directing the relevant activities of the investee.
In such a case, investor A is likely to meet the power criterion because it appears to have the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
Although investor B has currently exercisable options to purchase additional voting rights (that, if exercised, would give it a majority of the voting rights in the investee), the terms and conditions associated with those options are such that the options are not considered substantive.
Investor A has power over the investee because it holds voting rights of the investee together with substantive potential voting rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
Power when voting or similar rights do not have a significant effect on the investee's returns
In assessing the purpose and design of an investee (see paragraphs B5–B8), an investor shall consider the involvement and decisions made at the investee's inception as part of its design and evaluate whether the transaction terms and features of the involvement provide the investor with rights that are sufficient to give it power.
Being involved in the design of an investee alone is not sufficient to give an investor control.
However, involvement in the design may indicate that the investor had the opportunity to obtain rights that are sufficient to give it power over the investee.
In addition, an investor shall consider contractual arrangements such as call rights, put rights and liquidation rights established at the investee's inception.
When these contractual arrangements involve activities that are closely related to the investee, then these activities are, in substance, an integral part of the investee's overall activities, even though they may occur outside the legal boundaries of the investee.
Therefore, explicit or implicit decision-making rights embedded in contractual arrangements that are closely related to the investee need to be considered as relevant activities when determining power over the investee.
For some investees, relevant activities occur only when particular circumstances arise or events occur.
The investee may be designed so that the direction of its activities and its returns are predetermined unless and until those particular circumstances arise or events occur.
In this case, only the decisions about the investee's activities when those circumstances or events occur can significantly affect its returns and thus be relevant activities.
The circumstances or events need not have occurred for an investor with the ability to make those decisions to have power.
The fact that the right to make decisions is contingent on circumstances arising or an event occurring does not, in itself, make those rights protective.
Upon default of a receivable the investee automatically puts the receivable to an investor as agreed separately in a put agreement between the investor and the investee.
The only relevant activity is managing the receivables upon default because it is the only activity that can significantly affect the investee's returns.
Therefore, only the investor's right to manage the assets upon default should be considered when assessing the overall activities of the investee that significantly affect the investee's returns.
In this example, the design of the investee ensures that the investor has decision-making authority over the activities that significantly affect the returns at the only time that such decision-making authority is required.
The terms of the put agreement are integral to the overall transaction and the establishment of the investee.
Therefore, the terms of the put agreement together with the founding documents of the investee lead to the conclusion that the investor has power over the investee even though the investor takes ownership of the receivables only upon default and manages the defaulted receivables outside the legal boundaries of the investee.
The only assets of an investee are receivables.
When the purpose and design of the investee are considered, it is determined that the only relevant activity is managing the receivables upon default.
The party that has the ability to manage the defaulting receivables has power over the investee, irrespective of whether any of the borrowers have defaulted.
An investor may have an explicit or implicit commitment to ensure that an investee continues to operate as designed.
Such a commitment may increase the investor's exposure to variability of returns and thus increase the incentive for the investor to obtain rights sufficient to give it power.
Therefore a commitment to ensure that an investee operates as designed may be an indicator that the investor has power, but does not, by itself, give an investor power, nor does it prevent another party from having power.
When assessing whether an investor has control of an investee, the investor determines whether it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee.
Variable returns are returns that are not fixed and have the potential to vary as a result of the performance of an investee.
An investor assesses whether returns from an investee are variable and how variable those returns are on the basis of the substance of the arrangement and regardless of the legal form of the returns.
For example, an investor can hold a bond with fixed interest payments.
The fixed interest payments are variable returns for the purpose of this IFRS because they are subject to default risk and they expose the investor to the credit risk of the issuer of the bond.
The amount of variability (ie how variable those returns are) depends on the credit risk of the bond.
Similarly, fixed performance fees for managing an investee's assets are variable returns because they expose the investor to the performance risk of the investee.
The amount of variability depends on the investee's ability to generate sufficient income to pay the fee.
returns that are not available to other interest holders.
For example, an investor might use its assets in combination with the assets of the investee, such as combining operating functions to achieve economies of scale, cost savings, sourcing scarce products, gaining access to proprietary knowledge or limiting some operations or assets, to enhance the value of the investor's other assets.
When an investor with decision-making rights (a decision maker) assesses whether it controls an investee, it shall determine whether it is a principal or an agent.
An investor shall also determine whether another entity with decision-making rights is acting as an agent for the investor.
A decision maker is not an agent simply because other parties can benefit from the decisions that it makes.
An investor may delegate its decision-making authority to an agent on some specific issues or on all relevant activities.
When assessing whether it controls an investee, the investor shall treat the decision-making rights delegated to its agent as held by the investor directly.
Paragraphs B60–B72 provide guidance on determining whether a decision maker is an agent or a principal.
A decision maker shall consider the overall relationship between itself, the investee being managed and other parties involved with the investee, in particular all the factors below, in determining whether it is an agent
the scope of its decision-making authority over the investee (paragraphs B62 and B63).
the decision maker's exposure to variability of returns from other interests that it holds in the investee (paragraphs B71 and B72).
Different weightings shall be applied to each of the factors on the basis of particular facts and circumstances.
Determining whether a decision maker is an agent requires an evaluation of all the factors listed in paragraph B60 unless a single party holds substantive rights to remove the decision maker (removal rights) and can remove the decision maker without cause (see paragraph B65).
The scope of a decision maker's decision-making authority is evaluated by considering
the discretion that the decision maker has when making decisions about those activities.
A decision maker shall consider the purpose and design of the investee, the risks to which the investee was designed to be exposed, the risks it was designed to pass on to the parties involved and the level of involvement the decision maker had in the design of an investee.
For example, if a decision maker is significantly involved in the design of the investee (including in determining the scope of decision-making authority), that involvement may indicate that the decision maker had the opportunity and incentive to obtain rights that result in the decision maker having the ability to direct the relevant activities.
Rights held by other parties
Substantive rights held by other parties may affect the decision maker's ability to direct the relevant activities of an investee.
Substantive removal or other rights may indicate that the decision maker is an agent.
When a single party holds substantive removal rights and can remove the decision maker without cause, this, in isolation, is sufficient to conclude that the decision maker is an agent.
In addition, the greater the number of parties required to act together to exercise rights to remove a decision maker and the greater the magnitude of, and variability associated with, the decision maker's other economic interests (ie remuneration and other interests), the less the weighting that shall be placed on this factor.
Substantive rights held by other parties that restrict a decision maker's discretion shall be considered in a similar manner to removal rights when evaluating whether the decision maker is an agent.
For example, a decision maker that is required to obtain approval from a small number of other parties for its actions is generally an agent.
Consideration of the rights held by other parties shall include an assessment of any rights exercisable by an investee's board of directors (or other governing body) and their effect on the decision-making authority (see paragraph B23(b)).
In determining whether it is a principal or an agent the decision maker shall also consider whether the following conditions exist
A decision maker cannot be an agent unless the conditions set out in paragraph B69(a) and (b) are present.
However, meeting those conditions in isolation is not sufficient to conclude that a decision maker is an agent.
Exposure to variability of returns from other interests
A decision maker that holds other interests in an investee (eg investments in the investee or provides guarantees with respect to the performance of the investee), shall consider its exposure to variability of returns from those interests in assessing whether it is an agent.
Holding other interests in an investee indicates that the decision maker may be a principal.
In evaluating its exposure to variability of returns from other interests in the investee a decision maker shall consider the following
whether its exposure to variability of returns is different from that of the other investors and, if so, whether this might influence its actions.
For example, this might be the case when a decision maker holds subordinated interests in, or provides other forms of credit enhancement to, an investee.
The decision maker shall evaluate its exposure relative to the total variability of returns of the investee.
This evaluation is made primarily on the basis of returns expected from the activities of the investee but shall not ignore the decision maker's maximum exposure to variability of returns of the investee through other interests that the decision maker holds.
A decision maker (fund manager) establishes, markets and manages a publicly traded, regulated fund according to narrowly defined parameters set out in the investment mandate as required by its local laws and regulations.
The fund was marketed to investors as an investment in a diversified portfolio of equity securities of publicly traded entities.
Within the defined parameters, the fund manager has discretion about the assets in which to invest.
The fees are commensurate with the services provided.
The fund is not required to establish, and has not established, an independent board of directors.
The investors do not hold any substantive rights that would affect the decision-making authority of the fund manager, but can redeem their interests within particular limits set by the fund.
The fund manager receives a market-based fee for its services that is commensurate with the services provided and has also made a pro rata investment in the fund.
The remuneration and its investment expose the fund manager to variability of returns from the activities of the fund without creating exposure that is of such significance that it indicates that the fund manager is a principal.
In this example, consideration of the fund manager's exposure to variability of returns from the fund together with its decision-making authority within restricted parameters indicates that the fund manager is an agent.
A decision maker establishes, markets and manages a fund that provides investment opportunities to a number of investors.
The decision maker (fund manager) must make decisions in the best interests of all investors and in accordance with the fund's governing agreements.
Nonetheless, the fund manager has wide decision-making discretion.
Although it must make decisions in the best interests of all investors, the fund manager has extensive decision-making authority to direct the relevant activities of the fund.
The fund manager is paid fixed and performance-related fees that are commensurate with the services provided.
In addition, the remuneration aligns the interests of the fund manager with those of the other investors to increase the value of the fund, without creating exposure to variability of returns from the activities of the fund that is of such significance that the remuneration, when considered in isolation, indicates that the fund manager is a principal.
The investors can remove the fund manager by a simple majority vote, but only for breach of contract.
The other investors' rights to remove the fund manager are considered to be protective rights because they are exercisable only for breach of contract.
In this example, although the fund manager has extensive decision-making authority and is exposed to variability of returns from its interest and remuneration, the fund manager's exposure indicates that the fund manager is an agent.
The fund manager has a more substantial pro rata investment in the fund, but does not have any obligation to fund losses beyond that investment.
In this example, the other investors' rights to remove the fund manager are considered to be protective rights because they are exercisable only for breach of contract.
Although the fund manager is paid fixed and performance-related fees that are commensurate with the services provided, the combination of the fund manager's investment together with its remuneration could create exposure to variability of returns from the activities of the fund that is of such significance that it indicates that the fund manager is a principal.
The greater the magnitude of, and variability associated with, the fund manager's economic interests (considering its remuneration and other interests in aggregate), the more emphasis the fund manager would place on those economic interests in the analysis, and the more likely the fund manager is a principal.
However, in different circumstances (ie if the remuneration or other factors are different), control may arise when the level of investment is different.
The fund has a board of directors, all of whose members are independent of the fund manager and are appointed by the other investors.
If the board decided not to renew the fund manager's contract, the services performed by the fund manager could be performed by other managers in the industry.
However, the investors have substantive rights to remove the fund manager — the board of directors provides a mechanism to ensure that the investors can remove the fund manager if they decide to do so.
In this example, the fund manager places greater emphasis on the substantive removal rights in the analysis.
Thus, although the fund manager has extensive decision-making authority and is exposed to variability of returns of the fund from its remuneration and investment, the substantive rights held by the other investors indicate that the fund manager is an agent.
An investee is created to purchase a portfolio of fixed rate asset-backed securities, funded by fixed rate debt instruments and equity instruments.
The transaction was marketed to potential debt investors as an investment in a portfolio of asset-backed securities with exposure to the credit risk associated with the possible default of the issuers of the asset-backed securities in the portfolio and to the interest rate risk associated with the management of the portfolio.
A decision maker (the asset manager) manages the active asset portfolio by making investment decisions within the parameters set out in the investee's prospectus.
The asset manager can be removed, without cause, by a simple majority decision of the other investors.
The asset manager is paid fixed and performance-related fees that are commensurate with the services provided.
The remuneration aligns the interests of the fund manager with those of the other investors to increase the value of the fund.
In this example, the asset manager places greater emphasis on its exposure to variability of returns of the fund from its equity interest, which is subordinate to the debt instruments.
Thus, the asset manager concludes that it controls the investee.
The transaction was marketed to potential investors as an investment in a portfolio of highly rated medium-term assets with minimal exposure to the credit risk associated with the possible default by the issuers of the assets in the portfolio.
Various transferors sell high quality medium-term asset portfolios to the conduit.
Each transferor services the portfolio of assets that it sells to the conduit and manages receivables on default for a market-based servicing fee.
Each transferor also provides first loss protection against credit losses from its asset portfolio through over-collateralisation of the assets transferred to the conduit.
The sponsor establishes the terms of the conduit and manages the operations of the conduit for a market-based fee.
The fee is commensurate with the services provided.
The sponsor approves the sellers permitted to sell to the conduit, approves the assets to be purchased by the conduit and makes decisions about the funding of the conduit.
The sponsor must act in the best interests of all investors.
The sponsor is entitled to any residual return of the conduit and also provides credit enhancement and liquidity facilities to the conduit.
The liquidity facilities are not advanced against defaulted assets.
The investors do not hold substantive rights that could affect the decision-making authority of the sponsor.
Even though the sponsor is paid a market-based fee for its services that is commensurate with the services provided, the sponsor has exposure to variability of returns from the activities of the conduit because of its rights to any residual returns of the conduit and the provision of credit enhancement and liquidity facilities (ie the conduit is exposed to liquidity risk by using short-term debt instruments to fund medium-term assets).
Even though each of the transferors has decision-making rights that affect the value of the assets of the conduit, the sponsor has extensive decision-making authority that gives it the current ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the conduit's returns (ie the sponsor established the terms of the conduit, has the right to make decisions about the assets (approving the assets purchased and the transferors of those assets) and the funding of the conduit (for which new investment must be found on a regular basis)).
The right to residual returns of the conduit and the provision of credit enhancement and liquidity facilities expose the sponsor to variability of returns from the activities of the conduit that is different from that of the other investors.
Accordingly, that exposure indicates that the sponsor is a principal and thus the sponsor concludes that it controls the conduit.
The sponsor's obligation to act in the best interest of all investors does not prevent the sponsor from being a principal.
When assessing control, an investor shall consider the nature of its relationship with other parties and whether those other parties are acting on the investor's behalf (ie they are 'de facto agents').
The determination of whether other parties are acting as de facto agents requires judgement, considering not only the nature of the relationship but also how those parties interact with each other and the investor.
Such a relationship need not involve a contractual arrangement.
A party is a de facto agent when the investor has, or those that direct the activities of the investor have, the ability to direct that party to act on the investor's behalf.
In these circumstances, the investor shall consider its de facto agent's decision-making rights and its indirect exposure, or rights, to variable returns through the de facto agent together with its own when assessing control of an investee.
The following are examples of such other parties that, by the nature of their relationship, might act as de facto agents for the investor
a party that received its interest in the investee as a contribution or loan from the investor.
a party that has agreed not to sell, transfer or encumber its interests in the investee without the investor's prior approval (except for situations in which the investor and the other party have the right of prior approval and the rights are based on mutually agreed terms by willing independent parties).
a party that cannot finance its operations without subordinated financial support from the investor.
an investee for which the majority of the members of its governing body or for which its key management personnel are the same as those of the investor.
An investor shall consider whether it treats a portion of an investee as a deemed separate entity and, if so, whether it controls the deemed separate entity.
An investor shall treat a portion of an investee as a deemed separate entity if and only if the following condition is satisfied
Specified assets of the investee (and related credit enhancements, if any) are the only source of payment for specified liabilities of, or specified other interests in, the investee.
Parties other than those with the specified liability do not have rights or obligations related to the specified assets or to residual cash flows from those assets.
In substance, none of the returns from the specified assets can be used by the remaining investee and none of the liabilities of the deemed separate entity are payable from the assets of the remaining investee.
Such a deemed separate entity is often called a 'silo'.
When the condition in paragraph B77 is satisfied, an investor shall identify the activities that significantly affect the returns of the deemed separate entity and how those activities are directed in order to assess whether it has power over that portion of the investee.
When assessing control of the deemed separate entity, the investor shall also consider whether it has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with that deemed separate entity and the ability to use its power over that portion of the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns.
In that case, other parties exclude that portion of the investee when assessing control of, and in consolidating, the investee.
If there is a change in how power over an investee can be exercised, that change must be reflected in how an investor assesses its power over an investee.
For example, changes to decision-making rights can mean that the relevant activities are no longer directed through voting rights, but instead other agreements, such as contracts, give another party or parties the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
An event can cause an investor to gain or lose power over an investee without the investor being involved in that event.
For example, an investor can gain power over an investee because decision-making rights held by another party or parties that previously prevented the investor from controlling an investee have lapsed.
An investor also considers changes affecting its exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with an investee.
An investor shall consider whether its assessment that it acts as an agent or a principal has changed.
Changes in the overall relationship between the investor and other parties can mean that an investor no longer acts as an agent, even though it has previously acted as an agent, and vice versa.
For example, if changes to the rights of the investor, or of other parties, occur, the investor shall reconsider its status as a principal or an agent.
An entity shall consider all facts and circumstances when assessing whether it is an investment entity, including its purpose and design.
The definition of an investment entity requires that the purpose of the entity is to invest solely for capital appreciation, investment income (such as dividends, interest or rental income), or both.
In contrast, an entity that presents itself as an investor whose objective is to jointly develop, produce or market products with its investees has a business purpose that is inconsistent with the business purpose of an investment entity, because the entity will earn returns from the development, production or marketing activity as well as from its investments (see paragraph B85I).
An investment entity may also participate in the following investment-related activities, either directly or through a subsidiary, if these activities are undertaken to maximise the investment return (capital appreciation or investment income) from its investees and do not represent a separate substantial business activity or a separate substantial source of income to the investment entity
providing management services and strategic advice to an investee; and
providing financial support to an investee, such as a loan, capital commitment or guarantee.
An entity's investment plans also provide evidence of its business purpose.
Because equity investments and non-financial asset investments have the potential to be held indefinitely, an investment entity shall have an exit strategy documenting how the entity plans to realise capital appreciation from substantially all of its equity investments and non-financial asset investments.
An investment entity shall also have an exit strategy for any debt instruments that have the potential to be held indefinitely, for example perpetual debt investments.
The entity need not document specific exit strategies for each individual investment but shall identify different potential strategies for different types or portfolios of investments, including a substantive time frame for exiting the investments.
Exit mechanisms that are only put in place for default events, such as a breach of contract or non-performance, are not considered exit strategies for the purpose of this assessment.
Exit strategies can vary by type of investment.
For investments in private equity securities, examples of exit strategies include an initial public offering, a private placement, a trade sale of a business, distributions (to investors) of ownership interests in investees and sales of assets (including the sale of an investee's assets followed by a liquidation of the investee).
For equity investments that are traded in a public market, examples of exit strategies include selling the investment in a private placement or in a public market.
For real estate investments, an example of an exit strategy includes the sale of the real estate through specialised property dealers or the open market.
An investment entity may have an investment in another investment entity that is formed in connection with the entity for legal, regulatory, tax or similar business reasons.
In this case, the investment entity investor need not have an exit strategy for that investment, provided that the investment entity investee has appropriate exit strategies for its investments.
An entity is not investing solely for capital appreciation, investment income, or both, if the entity or another member of the group containing the entity (ie the group that is controlled by the investment entity's ultimate parent) obtains, or has the objective of obtaining, other benefits from the entity's investments that are not available to other parties that are not related to the investee.
the acquisition, use, exchange or exploitation of the processes, assets or technology of an investee.
This would include the entity or another group member having disproportionate, or exclusive, rights to acquire assets, technology, products or services of any investee; for example, by holding an option to purchase an asset from an investee if the asset's development is deemed successful;
financial guarantees or assets provided by an investee to serve as collateral for borrowing arrangements of the entity or another group member (however, an investment entity would still be able to use an investment in an investee as collateral for any of its borrowings);
an option held by a related party of the entity to purchase, from that entity or another group member, an ownership interest in an investee of the entity;
except as described in paragraph B85J, transactions between the entity or another group member and an investee that
are on terms that are unavailable to entities that are not related parties of either the entity, another group member or the investee;
are not at fair value; or
(iii) represent a substantial portion of the investee's or the entity's business activity, including business activities of other group entities.
Notwithstanding paragraph B85I(e), an entity is not disqualified from being classified as an investment entity merely because such investees trade with each other.
An essential element of the definition of an investment entity is that it measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis, because using fair value results in more relevant information than, for example, consolidating its subsidiaries or using the equity method for its interests in associates or joint ventures.
In order to demonstrate that it meets this element of the definition, an investment entity
provides investors with fair value information and measures substantially all of its investments at fair value in its financial statements whenever fair value is required or permitted in accordance with IFRSs; and
reports fair value information internally to the entity's key management personnel (as defined in IAS 24), who use fair value as the primary measurement attribute to evaluate the performance of substantially all of its investments and to make investment decisions.
In order to meet the requirement in B85K(a), an investment entity would
An investment entity may have some non-investment assets, such as a head office property and related equipment, and may also have financial liabilities.
The fair value measurement element of the definition of an investment entity in paragraph 27(c) applies to an investment entity's investments.
Accordingly, an investment entity need not measure its non-investment assets or its liabilities at fair value.
Typical characteristics of an investment entity
An investment entity typically holds several investments to diversify its risk and maximise its returns.
An entity may hold a portfolio of investments directly or indirectly, for example by holding a single investment in another investment entity that itself holds several investments.
There may be times when the entity holds a single investment.
However, holding a single investment does not necessarily prevent an entity from meeting the definition of an investment entity.
For example, an investment entity may hold only a single investment when the entity
is in its start-up period and has not yet identified suitable investments and, therefore, has not yet executed its investment plan to acquire several investments;
has not yet made other investments to replace those it has disposed of;
is established to pool investors' funds to invest in a single investment when that investment is unobtainable by individual investors (eg when the required minimum investment is too high for an individual investor); or
is in the process of liquidation.
Typically, an investment entity would have several investors who pool their funds to gain access to investment management services and investment opportunities that they might not have had access to individually.
Having several investors would make it less likely that the entity, or other members of the group containing the entity, would obtain benefits other than capital appreciation or investment income (see paragraph B85I).
Alternatively, an investment entity may be formed by, or for, a single investor that represents or supports the interests of a wider group of investors (eg a pension fund, government investment fund or family trust).
There may also be times when the entity temporarily has a single investor.
For example, an investment entity may have only a single investor when the entity
is within its initial offering period, which has not expired and the entity is actively identifying suitable investors;
has not yet identified suitable investors to replace ownership interests that have been redeemed; or
Typically, an investment entity has several investors that are not related parties (as defined in IAS 24) of the entity or other members of the group containing the entity.
Having unrelated investors would make it less likely that the entity, or other members of the group containing the entity, would obtain benefits other than capital appreciation or investment income (see paragraph B85I).
However, an entity may still qualify as an investment entity even though its investors are related to the entity.
This 'parallel' fund may qualify as an investment entity even though all of its investors are related parties.
An investment entity is typically, but is not required to be, a separate legal entity.
Ownership interests in an investment entity are typically in the form of equity or similar interests (eg partnership interests), to which proportionate shares of the net assets of the investment entity are attributed.
However, having different classes of investors, some of which have rights only to a specific investment or groups of investments or which have different proportionate shares of the net assets, does not preclude an entity from being an investment entity.
In addition, an entity that has significant ownership interests in the form of debt that, in accordance with other applicable IFRSs, does not meet the definition of equity, may still qualify as an investment entity, provided that the debt holders are exposed to variable returns from changes in the fair value of the entity's net assets.
combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries.
eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between entities of the group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full).
Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements.
If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that group member's financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the group's accounting policies.
An entity includes the income and expenses of a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements from the date it gains control until the date when the entity ceases to control the subsidiary.
Income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.
For example, depreciation expense recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income after the acquisition date is based on the fair values of the related depreciable assets recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.
When potential voting rights, or other derivatives containing potential voting rights, exist, the proportion of profit or loss and changes in equity allocated to the parent and non-controlling interests in preparing consolidated financial statements is determined solely on the basis of existing ownership interests and does not reflect the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights and other derivatives, unless paragraph B90 applies.
In some circumstances an entity has, in substance, an existing ownership interest as a result of a transaction that currently gives the entity access to the returns associated with an ownership interest.
In such circumstances, the proportion allocated to the parent and non-controlling interests in preparing consolidated financial statements is determined by taking into account the eventual exercise of those potential voting rights and other derivatives that currently give the entity access to the returns.
The financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements shall have the same reporting date.
When the end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same date as the financial statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.
If it is impracticable to do so, the parent shall consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary using the most recent financial statements of the subsidiary adjusted for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur between the date of those financial statements and the date of the consolidated financial statements.
An entity shall attribute the profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests.
The entity shall also attribute total comprehensive income to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the proportion held by non-controlling interests
When the proportion of the equity held by non-controlling interests changes, an entity shall adjust the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary.
The entity shall recognise directly in equity any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received, and attribute it to the owners of the parent.
However, sometimes circumstances indicate that the multiple arrangements should be accounted for as a single transaction.
In determining whether to account for the arrangements as a single transaction, a parent shall consider all the terms and conditions of the arrangements and their economic effects.
they are entered into at the same time or in contemplation of each other.
they form a single transaction designed to achieve an overall commercial effect.
An example is when a disposal of shares is priced below market and is compensated for by a subsequent disposal priced above market.
If a parent loses control of a subsidiary, it shall
the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost; and
the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost (including any components of other comprehensive income attributable to them).
the fair value of the consideration received, if any, from the transaction, event or circumstances that resulted in the loss of control;
if the transaction, event or circumstances that resulted in the loss of control involves a distribution of shares of the subsidiary to owners in their capacity as owners, that distribution; and
(iii) any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost.
reclassify to profit or loss, or transfer directly to retained earnings if required by other IFRSs, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the basis described in paragraph B99.
recognise any resulting difference as a gain or loss in profit or loss attributable to the parent.
If a parent loses control of a subsidiary, the parent shall account for all amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the parent had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the parent shall reclassify the gain or loss from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when it loses control of the subsidiary.
If a revaluation surplus previously recognised in other comprehensive income would be transferred directly to retained earnings on the disposal of the asset, the parent shall transfer the revaluation surplus directly to retained earnings when it loses control of the subsidiary.
Accounting for a change in investment entity status
The fair value of the subsidiary at the deemed acquisition date shall represent the transferred deemed consideration when measuring any goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase that arises from the deemed acquisition.
At the date of initial application, an entity shall assess whether it is an investment entity on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist at that date.
If, at the date of initial application, an entity concludes that it is an investment entity, it shall apply the requirements of paragraphs C3B–C3F instead of paragraphs C5–C5A.
the fair value of the investment entity's investment in the subsidiary.
If measuring an investment in a subsidiary in accordance with paragraphs C3B–C3C is impracticable (as defined in IAS 8), an investment entity shall apply the requirements of this IFRS at the beginning of the earliest period for which application of paragraphs C3B–C3C is practicable, which may be the current period.
If an investment entity has disposed of, or has lost control of, an investment in a subsidiary before the date of initial application of this IFRS, the investment entity is not required to make adjustments to the previous accounting for that subsidiary.
When the date that control was obtained is earlier than the beginning of the immediately preceding period, the investor shall recognise, as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the immediately preceding period, any difference between
the amount of assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests recognised; and
If measuring an investee's assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests in accordance with paragraph C4(a) or (b) is impracticable (as defined in IAS 8), an investor shall
The deemed acquisition date shall be the beginning of the earliest period for which application of paragraph C4(a) is practicable, which may be the current period.
The deemed acquisition date shall be the beginning of the earliest period for which the application of paragraph C4(b) is practicable, which may be the current period.
When the deemed acquisition date is earlier than the beginning of the immediately preceding period, the investor shall recognise, as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the immediately preceding period, any difference between
the requirements of this IFRS for all periods that the investee is retrospectively consolidated in accordance with paragraphs C4–C4A; or
When the date that the investor became involved with (but did not obtain control in accordance with this IFRS), or lost control of, the investee is earlier than the beginning of the immediately preceding period, the investor shall recognise, as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the immediately preceding period, any difference between
the previous carrying amount of the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests; and
the recognised amount of the investor's interest in the investee.
If measuring the interest in the investee in accordance with paragraph C5 is impracticable (as defined in IAS 8), an investor shall apply the requirements of this IFRS at the beginning of the earliest period for which application of paragraph C5 is practicable, which may be the current period.
If an entity does present adjusted comparative information for any earlier periods, all references to the 'immediately preceding period' in paragraphs C3B–C5A shall be read as the 'earliest adjusted comparative period presented'.
hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
Nature of the hedged risk and amount of the hedged item for which a hedging relationship may be designated
Disposal of a hedged foreign operation
Such foreign operations may be subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures or branches.
When translating the results and financial position of a foreign operation into a presentation currency, the entity is required to recognise foreign exchange differences in other comprehensive income until it disposes of the foreign operation.
If there is a designated hedging relationship, in the case of a net investment hedge, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge of the net investment is recognised in other comprehensive income and is included with the foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the results and financial position of the foreign operation.
This Interpretation provides guidance on identifying the foreign currency risks that qualify as a hedged risk in the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
This Interpretation provides guidance on how an entity should determine the amounts to be reclassified from equity to profit or loss for both the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
For convenience this Interpretation refers to such an entity as a parent entity and to the financial statements in which the net assets of foreign operations are included as consolidated financial statements.
All references to a parent entity apply equally to an entity that has a net investment in a foreign operation that is a joint venture, an associate or a branch.
the nature of the hedged risk and the amount of the hedged item for which a hedging relationship may be designated
whether the parent entity may designate as a hedged risk only the foreign exchange differences arising from a difference between the functional currencies of the parent entity and its foreign operation, or whether it may also designate as the hedged risk the foreign exchange differences arising from the difference between the presentation currency of the parent entity's consolidated financial statements and the functional currency of the foreign operation;
where in a group the hedging instrument can be held
whether a qualifying hedge accounting relationship can be established only if the entity hedging its net investment is a party to the hedging instrument or whether any entity in the group, regardless of its functional currency, can hold the hedging instrument;
what amounts should be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as reclassification adjustments on disposal of the foreign operation
when a foreign operation that was hedged is disposed of, what amounts from the parent entity's foreign currency translation reserve in respect of the hedging instrument and in respect of that foreign operation should be reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the parent entity's consolidated financial statements;
whether the method of consolidation affects the determination of the amounts to be reclassified from equity to profit or loss.
The carrying amount of the net assets of a foreign operation that may be designated as the hedged item in the consolidated financial statements of a parent depends on whether any lower level parent of the foreign operation has applied hedge accounting for all or part of the net assets of that foreign operation and that accounting has been maintained in the parent's consolidated financial statements.
However, if it is not maintained by the higher level parent entity, the hedge accounting applied by the lower level parent must be reversed before the higher level parent's hedge accounting is recognised.
In particular, the hedging strategy of the group should be clearly documented because of the possibility of different designations at different levels of the group.
Depending on where the hedging instrument is held, in the absence of hedge accounting the total change in value might be recognised in profit or loss, in other comprehensive income, or both.
However, the assessment of effectiveness is not affected by whether the change in value of the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income.
As part of the application of hedge accounting, the total effective portion of the change is included in other comprehensive income.
The assessment of effectiveness is not affected by whether the hedging instrument is a derivative or a non-derivative instrument or by the method of consolidation.
That amount is the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that was determined to be an effective hedge.
In the ultimate parent's consolidated financial statements, the aggregate net amount recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in respect of all foreign operations is not affected by the consolidation method.
The use of the step-by-step method of consolidation may result in the reclassification to profit or loss of an amount different from that used to determine hedge effectiveness.
This difference may be eliminated by determining the amount relating to that foreign operation that would have arisen if the direct method of consolidation had been used.
However, it is an accounting policy choice that should be followed consistently for all net investments.
Earlier application of both is permitted.
An entity is not required to comply with those requirements when first applying the Interpretation.
This appendix illustrates the application of the Interpretation using the corporate structure illustrated below.
In all cases the hedging relationships described would be tested for effectiveness in accordance with IFRS 9, although this testing is not discussed in this appendix.
Each of the subsidiaries is wholly owned.
Parent can hedge its net investment in each of Subsidiaries A, B and C for the foreign exchange risk between their respective functional currencies (Japanese yen (JPY), pounds sterling and US dollars) and euro.
In addition, Parent can hedge the USD / GBP foreign exchange risk between the functional currencies of Subsidiary B and Subsidiary C. In its consolidated financial statements, Subsidiary B can hedge its net investment in Subsidiary C for the foreign exchange risk between their functional currencies of US dollars and pounds sterling.
In the following examples the designated risk is the spot foreign exchange risk because the hedging instruments are not derivatives.
If the hedging instruments were forward contracts, Parent could designate the forward foreign exchange risk.
JPY / EUR spot foreign exchange rate change in other comprehensive income.
the GBP / USD spot foreign exchange rate change in the foreign currency translation reserve relating to Subsidiary C
A single hedging instrument can hedge the same designated risk only once.
Subsidiary B cannot apply hedge accounting in its consolidated financial statements because the hedging instrument is held outside the group comprising Subsidiary B and Subsidiary C.
Both amounts are included for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of the hedge designated in paragraph AG4 because the change in value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are computed by reference to the euro functional currency of Parent against the US dollar functional currency of Subsidiary C, in accordance with the hedge documentation.
The method of consolidation (ie direct method or step-by-step method) does not affect the assessment of the effectiveness of the hedge.
If Parent uses the direct method, its FCTR in respect of Subsidiary C will be determined directly by the EUR / USD foreign exchange rate.
If Parent uses the step-by-step method, its FCTR in respect of Subsidiary C will be determined by the FCTR recognised by Subsidiary B reflecting the GBP / USD foreign exchange rate, translated to Parent's functional currency using the EUR / GBP foreign exchange rate.
Other changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates are included in Parent's consolidated profit or loss.
Parent holds both USD and GBP hedging instruments
Parent may wish to hedge the foreign exchange risk in relation to its net investment in Subsidiary B as well as that in relation to Subsidiary C. Assume that Parent holds suitable hedging instruments denominated in US dollars and pounds sterling that it could designate as hedges of its net investments in Subsidiary B and Subsidiary C. The designations Parent can make in its consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the following
Subsidiary B holds the USD hedging instrument
Consequently, both the USD / GBP change in value of the external borrowing held by Subsidiary B and the GBP / EUR change in value of Parent's loan payable to Subsidiary B (equivalent to USD / EUR in total) would be included in the foreign currency translation reserve in Parent's consolidated financial statements.

The IASB added a further practical expedient to the transition requirements, which the FASB decided not to provide.
The boards undertook this project because their requirements for revenue needed improvement for the following reasons
In addition, IFRS had limited guidance on important topics such as revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements.
Consequently, some entities that were applying IFRS referred to parts of US GAAP to develop an appropriate revenue recognition accounting policy.
The comprehensive model also improves previous IFRS and US GAAP by
providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue recognition issues;
improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets;
simplifying the preparation of financial statements by reducing the amount of guidance to which entities must refer; and
requiring enhanced disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognised.
Respondents to the Discussion Paper generally supported the objective of developing a comprehensive revenue recognition model for both IFRS and US GAAP.
Most respondents also generally supported the recognition and measurement principles proposed in the Discussion Paper, which are the basic building blocks of the revenue recognition model.
In particular, the Discussion Paper introduced the concepts that a contract contains performance obligations for the entity to transfer goods or services to a customer and that revenue is recognised when the entity satisfies its performance obligations as a result of the customer obtaining control of those goods or services.
Respondents to the Discussion Paper were mainly concerned about the following proposals
identifying performance obligations only on the basis of the timing of the transfer of the good or service to the customer.
Respondents commented that this would be impractical, especially when many goods or services are transferred over time to the customer (for example, in construction contracts).
using the concept of control to determine when a good or service is transferred.
Respondents asked the boards to clarify the application of the concept of control to avoid the implication that the proposals would require completed contract accounting for all construction contracts (ie revenue is recognised only when the customer obtains legal title or physical possession of the completed asset).
The boards also received a substantial number of comment letters in response to a question asked by the FASB on whether the proposals should apply to non-public entities.
Almost all of those comment letters were from respondents associated with sections of the US construction industry (for example, private construction contractors, accounting firms that serve those contractors and surety providers who use the financial statements of construction contractors when deciding whether to guarantee that those contractors will meet their obligations under a contract).
Those respondents also raised concerns about the application of the proposed model to non-public entities.
Those issues were considered and discussed separately by the FASB.
With the exception of many of the responses from non-public entities in the construction industry, most of the feedback from the comment letters and from the consultation activities generally supported the boards' proposal for a comprehensive revenue recognition model for both IFRS and US GAAP.
Moreover, most respondents supported the core principle of that model, which was that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the amount of consideration that the entity expects to receive for those goods or services.
In particular, respondents were concerned about the application of the following
the concept of control and, in particular, the application of the indicators of the transfer of control to service contracts and to contracts for the transfer of an asset over time to a customer as it is being constructed (for example, a work-in-progress asset).
the principle of distinct goods or services for identifying performance obligations in a contract.
Many respondents were concerned that the proposed principle would lead to inappropriate disaggregation of the contract.
The boards decided unanimously that it was appropriate to go beyond their established due process and re-expose their revised revenue proposals, because of the importance of revenue to all entities and to avoid unintended consequences in the recognition of revenue for specific contracts or industries.
This consultation also included all major geographical regions and occurred in a number of formats.
Almost all respondents continued to support the core principle of the revenue recognition model, which is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
requests for clarifications and further refinements — such as on the criteria for identifying performance obligations, determining when a performance obligation is satisfied over time and constraining estimates of variable consideration;
difficulties in the practical application of the requirements — such as on the time value of money (referred to as a significant financing component in IFRS 15) and the retrospective application of the proposed Standard; and
disagreement with some of the proposed requirements for the following topics
(iv) applying the allocation principles to contracts that are prevalent in the telecommunications industry.
The boards' discussion of those concerns and their conclusions are included in the relevant sections of this Basis for Conclusions.
Throughout the project, some respondents questioned the need to replace the requirements for revenue recognition, particularly because those requirements seemed to work reasonably well in practice and provided useful information about the different types of contracts for which they were intended.
The boards acknowledged that it would have been possible to improve many of the previous revenue recognition requirements without replacing them.
However, even after the changes to US GAAP mentioned in paragraph BC14(a), the requirements in US GAAP would have continued to result in inconsistent accounting for revenue and, consequently, would not have provided a robust framework for addressing revenue recognition issues in the future.
Because revenue is a crucial number to users of financial statements, the boards decided that a common standard on revenue for IFRS and US GAAP is an important step toward achieving the goal of a single set of high-quality global accounting standards.
During the early stages of their Revenue Recognition project, the boards considered various alternative revenue recognition models, including the following
the basis for recognising revenue — specifically, whether an entity should recognise revenue only when it transfers a promised good or service to a customer (a contract-based revenue recognition principle) or when (or as) the entity undertakes a productive activity (which could be an activity that is undertaken regardless of whether a contract exists); and
the basis for measuring revenue — specifically, whether revenue should be measured at an allocated customer consideration amount (ie the transaction price) or at a current exit price.
In the Discussion Paper, the boards proposed a principle to recognise revenue on the basis of the accounting for the asset or the liability arising from a contract with a customer.
The boards decided that focusing on the recognition and measurement of the asset or liability arising from a contract with a customer and the changes in that asset or liability over the life of the contract would bring discipline to the earnings process approach.
Consequently, it would result in entities recognising revenue more consistently than they did under previous revenue recognition requirements.
Upon entering into a contract with a customer, an entity obtains rights to receive consideration from the customer and assumes obligations to transfer goods or services to the customer (performance obligations).
The combination of those rights and performance obligations gives rise to a (net) asset or a (net) liability depending on the relationship between the remaining rights and the performance obligations.
The contract is an asset (a contract asset) if the measure of the remaining rights exceeds the measure of the remaining performance obligations.
Conversely, the contract is a liability (a contract liability) if the measure of the remaining performance obligations exceeds the measure of the remaining rights.
By definition, revenue from a contract with a customer cannot be recognised until a contract exists.
Conceptually, revenue recognition could occur at the point at which an entity enters into a contract with a customer.
For an entity to recognise revenue at contract inception (before either party has performed), the measure of the entity's rights must exceed the measure of the entity's performance obligations.
This could occur if the rights and obligations were measured at current exit prices and would lead to revenue recognition because of an increase in a contract asset.
However, as described in paragraph BC25, the boards proposed in the Discussion Paper that performance obligations should be measured at the same amount as the rights in the contract at contract inception, thereby precluding the recognition of a contract asset and revenue at contract inception.
Therefore, the boards decided that revenue should be recognised only when an entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer, thereby satisfying a performance obligation in the contract.
That transfer results in revenue recognition, because upon satisfying a performance obligation an entity no longer has that obligation to provide the good or service.
Consequently, its position in the contract increases — either its contract asset increases or its contract liability decreases — and that increase leads to revenue recognition.
Although, conceptually, revenue arises from an increase in a contract asset or a decrease in a contract liability, the boards articulated the requirements in terms of the recognition and measurement of revenue rather than the recognition and measurement of the contract.
The boards noted that focusing on the timing and amount of revenue from a contract with a customer would simplify the requirements.
Nearly all respondents to the Discussion Paper agreed with the boards' view that an entity generally should not recognise revenue if there is no contract with a customer.
However, some respondents requested that the boards instead develop an activities model in which revenue would be recognised as the entity undertakes activities in producing or providing goods or services, regardless of whether those activities result in the transfer of goods or services to the customer.
Those respondents reasoned that recognising revenue over time, for example, throughout long-term construction or other service contracts, regardless of whether goods or services are transferred to the customer, would provide users of financial statements with more useful information.
However, the boards noted the following concerns about an activities model
revenue recognition would not have been based on accounting for the contract.
In an activities model, revenue arises from increases in the entity's assets, such as inventory or work-in-progress, rather than only from rights under a contract.
Consequently, conceptually, an activities model does not require a contract with a customer for revenue recognition, although revenue recognition could be precluded until a contract exists.
However, that would have resulted in revenue being recognised at contract inception for any activities completed to that point.
it would have been counterintuitive to many users of financial statements.
An entity would have recognised consideration as revenue when the customer had not received any promised goods or services in exchange.
there would have been potential for abuse.
An entity could have accelerated revenue recognition by increasing its activities (for example, production of inventory) at the end of a reporting period.
it would have resulted in a significant change to previous revenue recognition requirements and practices.
In many of those requirements, revenue was recognised only when goods or services were transferred to the customer.
For example, previous requirements in IFRS required revenue from the sale of a good to be recognised when the entity transferred ownership of the good to the customer.
Accordingly, the boards did not develop an activities model and they maintained their view that a contract-based revenue recognition principle is the most appropriate principle for a general revenue recognition standard for contracts with customers.
The boards decided that an allocated transaction price approach should be applied to measure performance obligations.
Using that approach, an entity would allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract (see paragraphs BC181 and BC266).
In the Discussion Paper, the boards considered an alternative approach to measure performance obligations directly at current exit prices.
However, the boards rejected that approach for the following reasons
an entity would have recognised revenue before transferring goods or services to the customer at contract inception if the measure of rights to consideration exceeded the measure of the remaining performance obligations.
That would have been a typical occurrence at contract inception, because the transaction price often includes amounts that enable an entity to recover its costs to obtain a contract.
any errors in identifying or measuring performance obligations could have affected revenue recognised at contract inception.
a current exit price (ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability) for the remaining performance obligations is typically not observable and an estimated current exit price could be complex and costly to prepare and difficult to verify.
Almost all respondents supported the boards' proposal to measure performance obligations using an allocated transaction price approach.
In the Discussion Paper, the boards also considered whether it would be appropriate to require an alternative measurement approach for some types of performance obligations (for example, performance obligations with highly variable outcomes, for which an allocated transaction price approach may not result in useful information).
However, the boards decided that the benefits of accounting for all performance obligations within the scope of the requirements using the same measurement approach outweighed any concerns about using that approach for some types of performance obligations.
for entities electing to use the full retrospective transition method, accounting for a contract completed under previous revenue Standards before transition to IFRS 15; and
In respect of the practical expedients, the IASB provided transition relief for modified contracts and completed contracts.
The IASB noted that, when new Standards are issued, there are always initial questions that arise.
Those questions are generally resolved as entities, auditors and others work through them over time, and gain a better understanding of the new requirements.
The IASB also considered the effect of any differences between its decisions and those made by the FASB.
The FASB made further amendments regarding some other requirements on identifying performance obligations.
In relation to licensing, the boards made the same clarifying amendments for sales-based and usage-based royalties.
The boards decided to make different amendments to the application guidance relating to identifying the nature of an entity's promise in granting a licence.
Presentation of sales taxes (determining the transaction price)
non-exchange transactions (for example, donations or contributions received);
for IFRS, changes in the value of biological assets, investment properties and the inventory of commodity broker-traders; and
(The FASB decided that the revenue arising from those assets or liabilities should be presented separately from revenue arising from contracts with customers.
The IASB noted that the definition in a previous revenue Standard referred to 'gross inflow of economic benefits' and it had concerns that some might have misread that reference as implying that an entity should recognise as revenue a prepayment from a customer for goods or services.
Definition of a contract (Appendix A)
Including such agreements would have been inconsistent with the boards' decision that a contract with a customer must be enforceable by law for an entity to recognise the rights and obligations arising from that contract.
The boards noted that the agreement does not need to be in writing to be a contract.
Whether the agreed-upon terms are written, oral or evidenced otherwise (for example, by electronic assent), a contract exists if the agreement creates rights and obligations that are enforceable against the parties.
Determining whether a contractual right or obligation is enforceable is a question to be considered within the context of the relevant legal framework (or equivalent framework) that exists to ensure that the parties' rights and obligations are upheld.
The boards observed that the factors that determine enforceability may differ between jurisdictions.
Although there must be enforceable rights and obligations between parties for a contract to exist, the boards decided that the performance obligations within the contract could include promises that result in the customer having a valid expectation that the entity will transfer goods or services to the customer even though those promises are not enforceable (see paragraph BC87).
Those criteria are derived mainly from previous revenue recognition requirements and other existing standards.
The boards decided that when some or all of those criteria are not met, it is questionable whether the contract establishes enforceable rights and obligations.
The boards' rationale for including those criteria is discussed in paragraphs BC35–BC46.
The boards decided that it was important to reassess the criteria in those cases, because that change might clearly indicate that the remaining contractual rights and obligations are no longer enforceable.
That is, an entity would not include in the reassessment (and therefore would not reverse) any receivables, revenue or contract assets already recognised.
Some respondents questioned whether oral and implied contracts could meet this criterion, especially if it is difficult to verify an entity's approval of that contract.
The boards noted that the form of the contract does not, in and of itself, determine whether the parties have approved the contract.
Instead, an entity should consider all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether the parties intend to be bound by the terms and conditions of the contract.
Consequently, in some cases, the parties to an oral or an implied contract (in accordance with customary business practices) may have agreed to fulfil their respective obligations.
In other cases, a written contract may be required to determine that the parties to the contract have approved it.
In addition, the boards decided that the parties should be committed to performing their respective obligations under the contract.
The boards noted that requiring all of the rights and obligations to be fulfilled would have inappropriately resulted in no recognition of revenue for some contracts in which the parties are substantially committed to the contract.
The entity can identify each party's rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred (paragraph 9(b))
The boards decided to include this criterion because an entity would not be able to assess the transfer of goods or services if it could not identify each party's rights regarding those goods or services.
The entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred (paragraph 9(c))
The boards decided to include this criterion because an entity would not be able to determine the transaction price if it could not identify the payment terms in exchange for the promised goods or services.
Respondents from the construction industry questioned whether an entity can identify the payment terms for orders for which the scope of work may already have been defined even though the specific amount of consideration for that work has not yet been determined and may not be finally determined for a period of time (sometimes referred to as unpriced change orders or claims).
The boards clarified that their intention is not to preclude revenue recognition for unpriced change orders if the scope of the work has been approved and the entity expects that the price will be approved.
The boards noted that, in those cases, the entity would consider the requirements for contract modifications (see paragraphs BC76–BC83).
The contract has commercial substance (paragraph 9(d))
The boards decided to include 'commercial substance' as a criterion when they discussed whether revenue should be recognised in contracts with customers that include non-monetary exchanges.
Without that requirement, entities might transfer goods or services back and forth to each other (often for little or no cash consideration) to artificially inflate their revenue.
Consequently, the boards decided that an entity should not recognise revenue from a non-monetary exchange if the exchange has no commercial substance.
The boards also observed that this criterion is important in all contracts (not only non-monetary exchanges) because without commercial substance it is questionable whether an entity has entered into a transaction that has economic consequences.
Consequently, the boards decided that all contracts should have commercial substance before an entity can apply the other requirements in the revenue recognition model.
It is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled (paragraph 9(e))
Furthermore, the boards decided to include this criterion as a consequence of their decision that customer credit risk should not affect the measurement or presentation of revenue (see paragraphs BC259–BC265).
The collectability threshold is related to that assessment because a key part of assessing whether a transaction is valid is determining the extent to which the customer has the ability and the intention to pay the promised consideration.
In addition, entities generally only enter into contracts in which it is probable that the entity will collect the amount to which it will be entitled.
The boards noted that the term 'probable' has different meanings under US GAAP and IFRS.
However, the boards noted that the term 'probable' was used in some of the collectability thresholds in their previous revenue recognition requirements and both boards wanted to maintain consistency with those requirements.
In either of those circumstances, an entity considers whether it is probable that the entity will collect the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled when the uncertainty relating to that consideration is resolved.
The entity assesses whether it is probable of collecting that amount by considering both of the following
the ability (ie the financial capacity) of the customer to pay the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services transferred.
the customer's intention to pay that amount.
The boards observed that an assessment of the customer's intention would require an entity to consider all of the facts and circumstances, including the past practice of that customer or customer class.
The boards noted that this assessment should be made on the assumption that the amount will be due (ie the corresponding performance obligation will be satisfied and the consideration is not subject to further variability that might affect the entity's entitlement to that consideration).
Therefore, if the customer were to fail to perform as promised and consequently the entity would respond to the customer's actions by not transferring any further goods or services to the customer, the entity would not consider the likelihood of payment for those goods or services that would not be transferred.
The discussion informed the boards that there are potentially different interpretations of
how to apply the collectability criterion in paragraph 9(e) when it is not probable that the total consideration promised in the contract is collectable; and
BC46B Paragraph 9(e) requires an entity to assess whether it is probable that it will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.
The TRG's discussions informed the boards that some stakeholders interpreted this requirement to mean that an entity should assess the probability of collecting all of the consideration promised in the contract.
Under this interpretation, some contracts with customers that are assessed as having poor credit quality would not meet the criteria in paragraph 9(e), even though they are otherwise valid contracts.
Other stakeholders asserted that those contracts would be valid if the entity has the ability to protect itself from credit risk.
BC46C The boards noted that the assessment in paragraph 9(e) requires an entity to consider how the entity's contractual rights to the consideration relate to its performance obligations.
That assessment considers the entity's exposure to the customer's credit risk and the business practices available to the entity to manage its exposure to credit risk throughout the contract.
The IASB noted that it expects practice to develop consistently with the boards' intentions in developing the collectability criterion in paragraph 9(e).
In reaching its decision, the IASB observed that an entity will generally not enter into a contract with a customer if the entity does not consider it to be probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.
This is consistent with the boards' reasoning in paragraph BC43.
It was not the boards' intention that many contracts should fail the condition in paragraph 9(e).
On this basis, the IASB thinks that the population of contracts to which any clarification to paragraph 9(e) might apply is small.
The TRG's discussions informed the boards about potential diversity in stakeholders' understanding of when a contract is terminated.
Some stakeholders asserted that a contract is terminated when an entity stops transferring promised goods or services to the customer.
Other stakeholders asserted that a contract is terminated only when the entity stops pursuing collection from the customer.
For example, entities sometimes pursue collection for a significant period of time after they have stopped transferring promised goods or services to the customer.
As a result, non-refundable consideration received from the customer might be recognised as a liability for a significant period of time during which an entity pursues collection, even though the entity may have stopped transferring promised goods or services to the customer and has no further obligations to transfer goods or services to the customer.
BC46H The IASB noted that contracts often specify that an entity has the right to terminate the contract in the event of non-payment by the customer and that this would not generally affect the entity's rights to recover any amounts owed by the customer.
The IASB also noted that an entity's decision to stop pursuing collection would not typically affect the entity's rights and the customer's obligations under the contract with respect to the consideration owed by the customer.
However, the boards decided not to include requirements for asset derecognition for these types of transactions, because including those requirements would be outside the scope of this project.
Those contracts would not affect an entity's financial position or performance until either party performs.
For instance, if only the customer could terminate the wholly unperformed contract without penalty, the entity is obliged to stand ready to perform at the discretion of the customer.
Similarly, if only the entity could terminate the wholly unperformed contract without penalty, it has an enforceable right to payment from the customer if it chooses to perform.
In accordance with IFRS 15, an entity's rights and obligations in wholly unperformed non-cancellable contracts are measured at the same amount and, therefore, would offset each other at inception.
Some respondents asked the boards to clarify the meaning of ordinary activities; however, the boards decided not to provide additional requirements, because the notion of ordinary activities is derived from the definitions of revenue in the boards' respective conceptual frameworks.
As noted in paragraph BC29, the boards did not reconsider those definitions as part of the Revenue Recognition project.
Some respondents asked the boards to clarify whether the parties to some common types of contracts (for example, contracts with collaborators or partners) would meet the definition of a customer.
However, the boards decided that it would not be feasible to develop application guidance that would apply uniformly to various industries because the nature of the relationship (ie supplier-customer versus collaboration or partnership) would depend on specific terms and conditions in those contracts.
The boards observed that in many arrangements highlighted by respondents, an entity would need to consider all relevant facts and circumstances, such as the purpose of the activities undertaken by the counterparty, to determine whether the counterparty is a customer.
Examples of arrangements in which an entity would need to make that assessment are as follows
collaborative research and development efforts between biotechnology and pharmaceutical entities or similar arrangements in the aerospace and defence, technology and healthcare industries or in higher education;
arrangements in the oil and gas industry in which partners in an offshore oil and gas field may make payments to each other to settle any differences between their proportionate entitlements to production volumes from the field during a reporting period; and
Exchanges of products to facilitate a sale to another party (paragraph 5(d))
In industries with homogeneous products, it is common for entities in the same line of business to exchange products to facilitate sales to customers or potential customers other than the parties to the exchange.
For example, an oil supplier may swap inventory with another oil supplier to reduce transport costs, meet immediate inventory needs, or otherwise facilitate the sale of oil to the end customer.
The boards noted that the party exchanging inventory with the entity meets the definition of a customer, because it has contracted with the entity to obtain an output of the entity's ordinary activities.
Consequently, in the absence of specific requirements, an entity might recognise revenue once for the exchange of inventory and then again for the sale of the inventory to the end customer.
The boards decided that this outcome would be inappropriate for the following reasons
it would have grossed up revenues and expenses and made it difficult for users of financial statements to assess the entity's performance and gross margins during the reporting period; and
some view the counterparty in those arrangements as also acting as a supplier and not as a customer.
financial instruments and other contractual rights or obligations within the scope of the boards' other Standards.
The boards decided that, within the context of those other projects, a different basis of accounting for those contracts with customers might provide users of financial statements with more relevant information.
Those respondents stated that some of the requirements for accounting for contract assets (which would meet the definition of a financial asset) are inconsistent with the requirements in financial instruments Standards for accounting for financial assets.
For example, in some cases a contract asset is not required to be adjusted for the time value of money (see paragraph BC236), and in other cases the contract asset might initially be measured at an amount that excludes some of the expected cash flows if the transaction price includes variable consideration (see paragraphs BC189–BC223).
Contracts partially within the scope of other Standards (paragraph 7)
This is because it could result in different accounting outcomes depending on whether the goods or services were sold on a stand-alone basis or together with other goods or services.
Consequently, the boards decided that if other Standards specify how to separate and/or initially measure parts of a contract, an entity should first apply those Standards.
The rationale for those criteria is described in paragraphs BC33–BC46.
In many cases, the contract that is accounted for separately will be the individual contract negotiated with the customer.
However, the structure and scope of a contract can vary depending on how the parties to the contract decide to record their agreement.
Many entities have a large number of contracts and as a result some respondents noted practical challenges in applying the model on a contract-by-contract basis.
The boards observed that the way in which an entity applies the model to its contracts is not a matter for which the boards should specify requirements.
The boards acknowledged that an entity would need to apply judgement in selecting the size and composition of the portfolio in such a way that the entity reasonably expects that application of the revenue recognition model to the portfolio would not differ materially from the application of the revenue recognition model to the individual contracts or performance obligations in that portfolio.
In their discussions, the boards indicated that they did not intend for an entity to quantitatively evaluate each outcome and, instead, the entity should be able to take a reasonable approach to determine the portfolios that would be appropriate for its types of contracts.
The boards observed that because it is a practical way to apply IFRS 15, the portfolio approach may be particularly useful in some industries in which an entity has a large number of similar contracts and applying the model separately for each contract may be impractical.
For example, entities in the telecommunications industry explained that implementing accounting systems to determine the stand-alone selling price for the promised goods or services in each contract and, in turn, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations identified in that contract would be complex and costly (see paragraphs BC287–BC293).
The boards decided that entering into contracts at or near the same time is a necessary condition for the contracts to be combined.
That decision is consistent with the objective of identifying the contract that is to be accounted for as the unit of account because that assessment is also performed at contract inception.
Thus, in those situations, combining the contracts with related parties results in a more appropriate depiction of the amount and timing of revenue recognition.
The boards also considered whether to specify that all contracts should be combined if they were negotiated as a package to achieve a single commercial objective, regardless of whether those contracts were entered into at or near the same time with the same customer.
However, the boards decided not to do this, primarily because they were concerned that doing so could have had the unintended consequence of an entity combining too many contracts and not faithfully depicting the entity's performance.
Furthermore, the boards decided that an entity should apply judgement to determine whether a contract is entered into 'at or near the same time'.
However, the boards noted that the longer the period between the commitments of the parties to the contracts, the more likely it is that the economic circumstances affecting the negotiations have changed.
The boards observed that previous revenue recognition requirements did not include a general framework for accounting for contract modifications.
As the revenue recognition model developed, the boards proposed different approaches to account for contract modifications.
However, each approach was developed with the overall objective of faithfully depicting an entity's rights and obligations in the modified contract.
The boards concluded that to faithfully depict the rights and obligations arising from a modified contract, an entity should account for some modifications prospectively and for other modifications on a cumulative catch-up basis.
The boards decided that when those criteria are met, there is no economic difference between an entity entering into a separate contract for the additional goods or services and an entity modifying an existing contract.
The boards also decided that a contract modification should be accounted for prospectively when the goods or services to be provided after the modification are distinct from the goods or services already provided (see paragraph 21(a) of IFRS 15).
The boards decided that this should be the case regardless of whether the pricing of the additional promised goods or services reflected their stand-alone selling prices.
This is because accounting for those types of modifications on a cumulative catch-up basis could be complex and may not necessarily faithfully depict the economics of the modification, because the modification is negotiated after the original contract and is based on new facts and circumstances.
Therefore, this approach avoids opening up the accounting for previously satisfied performance obligations and, thus, avoids any adjustments to revenue for satisfied performance obligations.
Some respondents were concerned that an entity would also be required to use a cumulative catch-up basis to account for modifications to a contract with a single performance obligation that is made up of a series of distinct goods or services.
Those contracts typically include repetitive services, such as energy contracts or mobile phone airtime services.
This is the case even if an entity determines that it has a single performance obligation, provided that the performance obligation represents a series of distinct goods or services (see paragraphs BC113–BC116).
The boards decided that if the remaining goods or services are not distinct and are part of a single performance obligation that is partially satisfied (ie a performance obligation satisfied over time), an entity should recognise the effect of the modification on a cumulative catch-up basis.
This requires an entity to update the transaction price and the measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation, both of which may change as a result of the contract modification.
That approach is particularly relevant to, and generally accepted in, the construction industry because a modification to those types of contracts would typically not result in the transfer of additional goods or services that are distinct from those promised in the existing contract.
IFRS and US GAAP previously included specific guidance for unpriced change orders and contract claims within construction-type and production-type contracts.
Interaction between changes in the transaction price and contract modifications
In their redeliberations, the boards noted that the proposal would result in very different accounting outcomes depending on whether a distinct good or service was included in the modification.
This is because modifications that change only the price would be accounted for on a cumulative catch-up basis, whereas modifications in which a distinct good or service (no matter how small) is added to the contract at the same time as a price change would be accounted for on a prospective basis.
Furthermore, the boards noted that changes in the transaction price arising from a contract modification and changes in the expectations of variable consideration are the result of different economic events — a change in the expectation of variable consideration arises from a change in a variable that was identified and agreed upon at contract inception, whereas a change in price arising from a contract modification arises from a separate and subsequent negotiation between the parties to the contract.
Consequently, the boards decided that a contract modification resulting only in a change in the contract price should be accounted for in a manner that is consistent with other contract modifications.
Some respondents requested that the boards clarify how an entity should allocate a change in the transaction price that occurs after a modification of the contract (that is accounted for in accordance with paragraph 21(a) of IFRS 15) but the change in the transaction price is attributable to an amount of variable consideration promised before the modification.
This may occur because the estimate of the amount of variable consideration in the initial contract has changed or is no longer constrained.
Specifically, those respondents asked whether, in those circumstances, an entity should allocate the corresponding change in the transaction price to the performance obligations in the modified contract, or to the performance obligations identified in the contract before the modification (ie the initial contract), including to performance obligations that were satisfied before the modification.
In providing that clarification, the boards noted that it would be appropriate in those circumstances to allocate a change in the transaction price to the performance obligations identified in the initial contract, if the promised variable consideration and the resolution of the uncertainty associated with that amount of variable consideration are not affected by the contract modification.
Definition of a performance obligation (Appendix A)
The notion of a performance obligation is similar to the notions of deliverables, components or elements of a contract in previous revenue Standards.
Although the notion of a performance obligation is implicit in previous revenue Standards, the term 'performance obligation' has not been defined previously.
The boards' objective in developing the definition of a performance obligation was to ensure that entities appropriately identify the unit of account for the goods and services promised in a contract with a customer.
The boards decided that because the revenue recognition model is an allocated transaction price model, identifying a meaningful unit of account that depicts the goods and services in the contract is fundamental for the purpose of recognising revenue on a basis that faithfully depicts the entity's performance in transferring the promised goods or services to the customer.
The boards decided that a performance obligation could be either of the following
a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct (see paragraphs BC94–BC112); or
a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer (see paragraphs BC113–BC116).
Before an entity can identify its performance obligations in a contract with a customer, the entity would first need to identify all of the promised goods or services in that contract.
The boards noted that in many cases, all of the promised goods or services in a contract might be identified explicitly in that contract.
However, in other cases, promises to provide goods or services might be implied by the entity's customary business practices.
The boards decided that such implied promises should be considered when determining the entity's performance obligations, if those practices create a valid expectation of the customer that the entity will transfer a good or service (for example, some when-and-if-available software upgrades).
The boards also noted that the implied promises in the contract do not need to be enforceable by law.
The boards noted that in the absence of these requirements developed by the boards, an entity might recognise all of the consideration in a contract as revenue even though the entity continues to have remaining (implicit) promises related to the contract with the customer.
Examples of such promised goods or services may include 'free' handsets provided by telecommunication entities, 'free' maintenance provided by automotive manufacturers and customer loyalty points awarded by supermarkets, airlines and hotels.
Those respondents stated that revenue should be recognised only for the main goods or services for which the customer has contracted and not for what they consider to be marketing incentives and other incidental obligations.
The boards observed that when a customer contracts with an entity for a bundle of goods or services, it can be difficult and subjective for the entity to identify the main goods or services for which the customer has contracted.
In addition, the outcome of that assessment could vary significantly depending on whether the entity performs the assessment from the perspective of its business model or from the perspective of the customer.
Consequently, the boards decided that all goods or services promised to a customer as a result of a contract give rise to performance obligations because those promises were made as part of the negotiated exchange between the entity and its customer.
Although the entity might consider those goods or services to be marketing incentives or incidental goods or services, they are goods or services for which the customer pays and to which the entity should allocate consideration for purposes of revenue recognition.
However, the boards observed that in some cases, an entity might provide incentives to a customer that would not represent a performance obligation if those incentives are provided independently of the contract that they are designed to secure.
In response to feedback received, the boards clarified that the following can also represent promised goods or services
providing a service of standing ready or making goods or services available (see paragraph BC160); and
granting rights to goods or services to be provided in the future (see paragraph BC92).
The boards observed that it was important to clarify that granting a right to goods or services to be provided in the future, such as when an entity makes a promise to provide goods or services to its customer's customer, would give rise to performance obligations for the entity.
Those types of promises exist in distribution networks in various industries but are particularly common in the automotive industry.
For example, when a manufacturer sells a motor vehicle to its customer (a dealer), the manufacturer may also promise to provide additional goods or services (such as maintenance) to the dealer's customer.
Consequently, a promise of a good or service (such as maintenance) that the customer can pass on to its customer would be a performance obligation if the promise could be identified (explicitly or implicitly) in the contract with the customer.
However, the boards noted that some promised goods or services might not represent performance obligations if those promises did not exist (explicitly or implicitly) at the time that the parties agreed to the contract.
The boards also clarified that an entity should not account for activities it may perform that do not transfer goods or services to the customer.
This may occur in many contracts in which an entity undertakes separate activities that do not directly transfer goods or services to the customer (for example, service contracts that require significant setup costs), even though those activities are required to successfully transfer the goods or services for which the customer has contracted.
The boards decided that including those activities as performance obligations would have been inconsistent with the core revenue recognition principle because those activities do not result in a transfer of goods or services to the customer.
Contracts with customers can include many promises to transfer goods or services.
In the Discussion Paper, the boards proposed that an entity should review the timing of the transfer of the promised goods or services to identify the performance obligations that it should account for separately.
Respondents to the Discussion Paper were concerned that this proposal would have required an entity to account separately for every promised good or service in a contract that is transferred at a different time, which would not be practical for many contracts, especially for long-term service and construction contracts.
Consequently, the boards decided to provide clearer requirements that result in an entity identifying performance obligations in a way that is practical and results in a pattern of revenue recognition that faithfully depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer.
In developing those requirements, the boards observed that in many contracts, identifying the promised goods or services that an entity should account for separately is straightforward.
That principle is the notion of a distinct good or service.
The term 'distinct', in an ordinary sense, suggests something that is different, separate or dissimilar.
A majority of respondents agreed with using the principle of distinct goods or services to identify the performance obligations in a contract.
However, many asked the boards to refine and further clarify the requirements for determining when a good or service is distinct.
The boards' deliberations of those criteria are discussed in the following sections.
The boards decided that a good or service must possess some specified minimum characteristics to be accounted for separately.
The boards were concerned that requiring an entity to account separately (and estimate a stand-alone selling price) for a good or service that is not capable of providing a benefit to the customer might result in information that would not be relevant to users of financial statements.
For example, if an entity transferred a machine to the customer, but the machine is only capable of providing a benefit to the customer after an installation process that only the entity can provide, the machine would not be distinct.
Respondents requested additional guidance on the meaning of 'distinct function' because they considered that almost any element of a contract could have utility in combination with other goods or services.
Those requirements focus on the notion of economic benefits, which many respondents explained was helpful in assessing whether the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other resources.
The boards noted that, conceptually, any good or service that is regularly sold separately should be able to be used on its own or with other resources.
Otherwise, there would be no market for an entity to provide that good or service on a stand-alone basis.
Consequently, an entity would disregard any contractual limitations that might preclude the customer from obtaining readily available resources from a source other than the entity.
BC101 The attributes of a distinct good or service are comparable to previous revenue recognition requirements for identifying separate deliverables in a multiple-element arrangement, which specified that a delivered item must have 'value to the customer on a stand-alone basis' for an entity to account for that item separately.
However, the boards decided against using that terminology to avoid the implication that an entity must assess the customer's intended use for the promised goods or services in identifying the performance obligations in a contract.
The boards observed that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for an entity to know the customer's intentions in a given contract.
Distinct within the context of the contract
BC102 In some cases, even though the individual goods or services promised as a bundle of goods or services might be capable of being distinct, those goods or services should not be accounted for separately because it would not result in a faithful depiction of the entity's performance in that contract.
As an example, many construction-type and production-type contracts involve transferring to the customer many goods and services that are capable of being distinct (such as various building materials, labour and project management services).
However, identifying all of those individual goods and services as separate performance obligations would be impractical and, more importantly, it would neither faithfully represent the nature of the entity's promise to the customer nor result in a useful depiction of the entity's performance.
This is because it would result in an entity recognising and measuring revenue when the materials and other inputs to the construction or production process are provided, instead of recognising and measuring revenue when the entity performs (and uses those inputs) in the construction or production of the item (or items) for which the customer has contracted.
Consequently, the boards decided that, when identifying whether goods or services are distinct, an entity should not only consider the characteristics of an individual good or service (see paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15) but should also consider whether the promise to transfer the good or service is separately identifiable (ie distinct within the context of the contract, see paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15).
BC103 During the development of IFRS 15, the existence of 'separable risks' was identified as a basis for assessing whether a good or service is distinct within the context of the contract.
In that assessment, the individual goods or services in a bundle would not be distinct if the risk that an entity assumes to fulfil its obligation to transfer one of those promised goods or services to the customer is a risk that is inseparable from the risk relating to the transfer of the other promised goods or services in that bundle.
BC104 To make the notion of separable risks more operable, the boards considered other approaches for articulating the notion.
However, the boards rejected those approaches for the following reasons
In addition, for some goods or services, especially software and other types of intellectual property, cost is not a significant factor in determining price and, therefore, margins could be highly variable because they may be determined by the customer's ability to pay or to obtain substitute goods or services from another entity.
However, each factor was developed because it may be more applicable for particular contracts or industries.
The rationale for each factor is discussed in paragraphs BC107–BC112.
Significant integration service (paragraph 29(a))
Thus, the individual goods or services are inputs to produce a single output.
The boards observed that this factor may be relevant in many construction contracts in which the contractor provides an integration (or contract management) service to manage and co-ordinate the various construction tasks and to assume the risks associated with the integration of those tasks.
Moreover, the integration service will require a contractor to co-ordinate the tasks performed by any subcontractors and ensure that those tasks are performed in accordance with the contract specifications, thus ensuring the individual goods or services are appropriately incorporated into the combined item for which the customer has contracted.
However, the boards did not intend for this factor to be applied too broadly to software integration services for which the risk that the entity assumes in integrating the promised goods or services is negligible (for example, a simple installation of software that does not require significant modification).
Significant modification or customisation (paragraph 29(b))
This is because if a good or service modifies or customises another good or service in the contract, each good or service is being assembled together (ie as inputs) to produce a combined output for which the customer has contracted.
BC110 For example, an entity may promise to provide a customer with existing software and also promise to customise that software so that it will function with the customer's existing infrastructure such that the entity is providing the customer with a fully integrated system.
In this case, if the customisation service requires the entity to significantly modify the existing software in such a way that the risks of providing the software and the customisation service are inseparable, the entity may conclude that the promises to transfer the software and the customisation service would not be separately identifiable and, therefore, those goods or services would not be distinct within the context of the contract.
Highly dependent or highly interrelated (paragraph 29(c))
However, the individual goods and services in the contract may still not be separately identifiable from the other goods or services promised in the contract.
The specifications for the product include functionality that has yet to be proved.
Consequently, the entity will be required to continue to revise the design of the product during the construction and testing of the prototypes and make any necessary modifications to in-progress or completed prototypes.
The entity expects that most or all of the units to be produced may require some rework because of design changes made during the production process.
This is because the risk of providing the design service is inseparable from the manufacturing service.
Thus, although each promise may have benefit on its own, within the context of the contract, they are not separately identifiable.
This is because the entity determines that each promise is highly dependent on, and highly interrelated with, the other promises in the contract.
A series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer (paragraph 22(b))
The boards decided to include this notion as part of the definition of a performance obligation to simplify the application of the model and to promote consistency in the identification of performance obligations in circumstances in which the entity provides the same good or service consecutively over a period of time (for example, a repetitive service arrangement).
BC114 The boards observed that without this part of the definition, applying the model might present some operational challenges when an entity provides a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same.
Otherwise, the entity would be required to identify multiple distinct goods or services, allocate the transaction price to each of the resulting performance obligations on a stand-alone selling price basis and then recognise revenue when those performance obligations are satisfied.
The entity will then recognise revenue by applying a single measure of progress to that performance obligation.
This is because, in those cases, an entity is not precluded from accounting for the goods or services as if they were a single performance obligation, if the outcome is the same as accounting for the goods and services as individual performance obligations.
Promised goods or services that are immaterial within the context of the contract
The FASB decided to specify that an entity is required to consider whether a promised good or service is material only at the contract level because it would be unduly burdensome to require an entity to aggregate and determine the effect on its financial statements of those items or activities determined to be immaterial at the contract level.
In addition, the FASB decided to specify that an entity is required to accrue the costs, if any, to transfer immaterial goods or services to the customer in instances in which the costs will be incurred after the satisfaction of the performance obligation (and recognition of revenue) to which those immaterial goods or services relate.
The TRG's discussion highlighted that the concerns raised primarily related to potential changes to practice under US GAAP.
Previous revenue Standards under IFRS did not contain similar language to the guidance issued by the staff of the US Securities and Exchange Commission on inconsequential or perfunctory performance obligations.
As described in paragraph BC84, the boards intended the notion of a performance obligation to be similar to the notions of deliverables, components or elements of a contract in previous revenue Standards.
Accordingly, although an entity makes an assessment of the goods or services promised in a contract in order to identify material performance obligations, the boards did not intend to require an entity to individually identify every possible promised good or service.
The IASB further noted that materiality is an overarching concept that applies throughout IFRS and not just when it is mentioned explicitly.
The discussion informed the boards about potential diversity in stakeholders' understanding and indicated that there was a risk of paragraph 29(c) being applied more broadly than intended, resulting in promised goods or services being inappropriately combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation.
Some stakeholders suggested that, although the promised goods or services may be capable of being distinct, if one of the goods or services was dependent on the other, the promised goods or services would not be distinct within the context of the contract.
They expressed concerns about differences in wording between IFRS and US GAAP and also indicated that the FASB's proposed amendments would improve the understanding of the separately identifiable principle and the operability of the requirements.
Consequently, in its redeliberations of the amendments the IASB concluded that the benefits of retaining converged requirements on this topic outweigh the potential costs of amending the requirements.
The boards observed that applying the principle in paragraph 27(b) requires judgement, taking into account facts and circumstances (see paragraph BC105).
For example, in a contract to build a wall, the promise to provide bricks and the promise to provide labour are not separately identifiable from each other within the context of the contract because those promises together comprise the promise to the customer to build the wall.
Although the boards decided not to use this terminology in IFRS 15, the notion of separable risks continues to influence the separately identifiable principle.
The evaluation of whether an entity's promise is separately identifiable considers the relationship between the various goods or services within the contract in the context of the process of fulfilling the contract.
Therefore, an entity should consider the level of integration, interrelation or interdependence among the promises to transfer goods or services.
This clarification emphasises that the separately identifiable principle is applied within the context of the bundle of promised goods or services in the contract rather than within the context of each individual promised good or service.
The separately identifiable principle is intended to identify when an entity's performance in transferring a bundle of goods or services in a contract is fulfilling a single promise to a customer.
Furthermore, the boards concluded that it may be clearer to structure those factors to identify when the promises in a bundle of promised goods or services are not separately identifiable and, therefore, constitute a single performance obligation.
Similarly, the boards also noted that the factors are not intended to be criteria that are evaluated independently of the separately identifiable principle.
Given the wide variety of revenue arrangements that are within the scope of IFRS 15, the boards expect that there will be some instances for which the factors will be less relevant to the evaluation of the separately identifiable principle.
BC116O Stakeholders also asked about the effect of contractual restrictions on the identification of performance obligations.
There are some similarities between the fact pattern in the example and other contracts with customers that involve project management, the production of customised goods or the manufacture of a series of identical goods.
As a result, the entity's promise is to establish and provide a service of producing the contracted devices based on the customer's specifications.
Under previous revenue Standards, entities often did not account for shipping provided in conjunction with the sale of their goods as an additional service.
As a result, some stakeholders raised cost-benefit concerns and asked whether relief should be provided in respect of shipping and handling activities from the general requirement to assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer in order to identify performance obligations.
BC116S When the boards discussed these concerns, board members noted that shipping and handling activities that occur before the customer obtains control of the related good are fulfilment activities.
However, if control of a good has been transferred to a customer, shipping and handling services are provided in relation to the customer's good, which may indicate that the entity is providing a service to the customer.
permit an entity, as an accounting policy election, to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as fulfilment activities; and
explicitly state that shipping and handling activities that occur before the customer obtains control of the related good are fulfilment activities.
The introduction of a policy choice would override this requirement.
This is because an entity satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control of the promised good or service underlying that performance obligation to the customer.
However, the boards decided that an entity should assess the transfer of a good or service by considering when the customer obtains control of that good or service, for the following reasons
For example, if an entity transfers a product to a customer but retains some risks associated with that product, an assessment based on risks and rewards might result in the entity identifying a single performance obligation that could be satisfied (and therefore revenue would be recognised) only after all the risks are eliminated.
Those performance obligations would be satisfied at different times.
However, some respondents indicated that the transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership is sometimes a helpful indicator that control has transferred (see paragraph BC154).
Developing the notion of control
Thus, the boards determined that control of a promised good or service (ie an asset) is the customer's ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset.
The components that make up the description of control are explained as follows
For example, in a contract that requires a manufacturer to produce an asset for a particular customer, it might be clear that the customer will ultimately have the right to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset.
However, the entity should not recognise revenue until the customer has actually obtained that right (which, depending on the contract, might occur during production or afterwards).
obtain the benefits from — the customer must have the ability to obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from an asset for the customer to obtain control of it.
Conceptually, the benefits from a good or service are potential cash flows (either an increase in cash inflows or a decrease in cash outflows).
A customer can obtain the benefits directly or indirectly in many ways, such as by using, consuming, disposing of, selling, exchanging, pledging or holding an asset.
Consequently, revenue could be recognised when the seller surrenders control of a good or service or when the customer obtains control of that good or service.
Although in many cases both perspectives lead to the same result, the boards decided that control should be assessed primarily from the perspective of the customer.
That perspective minimises the risk of an entity recognising revenue from undertaking activities that do not coincide with the transfer of goods or services to the customer.
Applying the notion of control
They commented that applying the concept of control is straightforward in those cases because, typically, it is clear that an asset has transferred from the entity to its customer.
They noted, however, that the requirements were more difficult to apply to performance obligations for services and construction-type contracts, because it could be difficult to determine when a customer obtains control of a service.
This is because in many service contracts the service asset is simultaneously created and consumed and, therefore, is never recognised as an asset by the customer.
Even in the case of a construction contract in which there is a recognisable asset, it can be difficult to assess whether a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, a partially completed asset that the seller is creating.
Consequently, many respondents in the construction industry were concerned that they would be required to change their revenue recognition policy from using a percentage-of-completion method to a completed contract method (ie on the basis that the transfer of assets occurs only upon transfer of legal title or physical possession of the finished asset, which typically occurs upon contract completion).
Those respondents explained that the outcome of applying the completed contract method to their contracts with customers would not be a faithful depiction of the economics of those contracts.
However, the boards observed that it would be difficult to clearly define a service and not all contracts that are commonly regarded as services result in a transfer of resources to customers over time.
Furthermore, the boards decided that the notion of control should apply equally to both goods and services.
Consequently, to address respondents' concerns, the boards decided to specify requirements that focus on the attribute of the timing of when a performance obligation is satisfied (ie when a good or service is transferred to a customer).
Those criteria are explained in the following paragraphs.
Customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as entity performs (paragraph 35(a))
BC125 In many typical service contracts, the entity's performance creates an asset only momentarily, because that asset is simultaneously received and consumed by the customer.
In those cases, the simultaneous receipt and consumption of the asset that has been created means that the customer obtains control of the entity's output as the entity performs and, thus, the entity's performance obligation is satisfied over time.
Consider, for example, a freight logistics contract in which the entity has agreed to transport goods from Vancouver to New York City.
Many respondents suggested that the customer receives no benefit from the entity's performance until the goods are delivered to New York City.
The boards observed that, in those cases, the assessment of whether another entity would need to substantially re-perform the performance completed to date can be used as an objective basis for determining whether the customer receives benefit from the entity's performance as it is provided.
BC127 The boards decided that an entity should disregard any contractual or practical limitations when it assesses the 'simultaneously receives and consumes' criterion and whether another entity would need to substantially re-perform the performance completed to date.
This is because the objective of this criterion is to determine whether control of the goods or services has already been transferred to the customer.
This is done by using a hypothetical assessment of what another entity would need to do if it were to take over the remaining performance.
Thus, actual practical or contractual limitations on the remaining performance would have no bearing on the assessment of whether the entity has transferred control of the goods or services provided to date.
Performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as it is created (paragraph 35(b))
BC129 The boards included this criterion to address situations in which an entity's performance creates or enhances an asset that a customer clearly controls as the asset is created or enhanced.
In those cases, because the customer controls any work in progress, the customer is obtaining the benefits of the goods or services that the entity is providing and, thus, the performance obligation is satisfied over time.
For example, in the case of a construction contract in which the entity is building on the customer's land, the customer generally controls any work in progress arising from the entity's performance.
BC130 The boards observed that the basis for this criterion is consistent with the rationale for using the 'percentage-of-completion' revenue recognition approach in previous revenue guidance in US GAAP.
That guidance acknowledged that in many construction contracts the entity has, in effect, agreed to sell its rights to the asset (ie work-in-progress) as the entity performs.
Accordingly, the parties have agreed, in effect, to a continuous sale (ie the customer controls the work-in-progress) that occurs as the work progresses.
However, the boards observed that for some performance obligations, it may be unclear whether the asset that is created or enhanced is controlled by the customer.
Performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (paragraph 35(c))
The boards observed that this criterion may be necessary for services that may be specific to a customer (for example, consulting services that ultimately result in a professional opinion for the customer) but also for the creation of tangible (or intangible) goods.
Performance does not create an asset with an alternative use
This is because when the entity's performance creates an asset with an alternative use to the entity, the entity could readily direct the asset to another customer and, therefore, the customer would not control the asset as it is being created.
This may occur in the creation of many standard inventory-type items for which the entity has the discretion to substitute across different contracts with customers.
In those cases, the customer cannot control the asset because the customer does not have the ability to restrict the entity from directing that asset to another customer.
In that case, the customer could be regarded as receiving the benefit of that performance and, consequently, as having control of the goods or services (ie the asset being created) as the performance occurs.
In determining whether the entity is limited practically from directing the asset for another use, the boards decided that an entity should consider the characteristics of the asset that will ultimately be transferred to the customer.
This may occur in some manufacturing contracts in which the basic design of the asset is the same across all contracts, but the customisation is substantial.
Consequently, redirecting the asset in its completed state to another customer would require significant rework.
BC137 Although the level of customisation might be a helpful factor to consider when assessing whether an asset has an alternative use, the boards decided that it should not be a determinative factor.
This is because in some cases (for example, some real estate contracts), an asset may be standardised but may still not have an alternative use to an entity, as a result of substantive contractual restrictions that preclude the entity from readily directing the asset to another customer.
If a contract precludes an entity from transferring an asset to another customer and that restriction is substantive, the entity does not have an alternative use for that asset because it is legally obliged to direct the asset to the customer.
Consequently, this indicates that the customer controls the asset as it is created, because the customer has the present ability to restrict the entity from directing that asset to another customer (an entity would also need to consider whether a right to payment exists to conclude that control of the asset transfers over time as it is created, see paragraphs BC142–BC148).
The boards observed that contractual restrictions are often relevant in real estate contracts, but might also be relevant in other types of contracts.
The boards observed that a protective right typically results in the entity having the practical ability to physically substitute or redirect the asset without the customer being aware of or objecting to the change.
For example, a contract might state that an entity cannot transfer a good because a customer has legal title to the goods in the contract.
However, the customer's legal title to the goods is intended to protect the customer in the event of the entity's liquidation and the entity can physically substitute and redirect the goods to another customer for little cost.
In this example, the contractual restriction is merely a protective right and does not indicate that control of the goods have transferred to the customer.
The boards noted that this difference is appropriate.
Although the objective of both criteria is to assess when control transfers over time, each criterion provides a different method for assessing when that control transfers, because the criteria were designed to apply to different scenarios.
Otherwise, an entity would need to continually reassess whether the asset has an alternative use, which could lead to a pattern of performance (and, therefore, revenue recognition) that is not useful.
Consequently, the boards decided that to demonstrate that a customer controls an asset that has no alternative use as it is being created, an entity must also have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
The entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date
This is because if an asset that an entity is creating has no alternative use to the entity, the entity is effectively constructing an asset at the direction of the customer.
Consequently, the entity will want to be economically protected from the risk of the customer terminating the contract and leaving the entity with no asset or an asset that has little value to the entity.
That protection will be established by requiring that if the contract is terminated, the customer must pay for the entity's performance completed to date.
This is consistent with other exchange contracts in which a customer would typically be obliged to pay only if it has received control of goods or services in the exchange.
Consequently, the fact that the customer is obliged to pay for the entity's performance (or, in other words, is unable to avoid paying for that performance) suggests that the customer has obtained the benefits from the entity's performance.
This is because the underlying objective of the criterion is to determine whether the entity is transferring control of goods or services to the customer as an asset is being created for that customer.
Consequently, assuming there is rational behaviour and that there are no broader perceived economic benefits that might exist outside the scope of the contract with the customer, the entity would only agree to transfer control of the goods or services to the customer if the entity is compensated for the costs associated with fulfilling the contract and it receives a profit margin that includes a return on those costs.
However, the boards decided that to demonstrate compensation for performance completed to date, the compensation should be based on a reasonable proportion of the entity's expected profit margin or be a reasonable return on the entity's cost of capital.
Furthermore, the boards noted that the focus should be on the amount to which the entity would be entitled upon termination rather than the amount to which the entity might ultimately be willing to settle for in a negotiation.
For example, consider a consulting contract in which the consulting entity agrees to provide a report at the end of the contract for a fixed amount that is conditional on providing that report.
If the entity were performing under that contract, it would have a right to payment for performance completed to date if the terms of the contract (or other law) require the customer to compensate the entity for its work completed to date if the customer terminates the contract without cause before completion.
The boards clarified this notion because the contractual payment terms in the contract might not always align with the entity's enforceable rights to payment for performance completed to date.
The boards decided that that type of payment would meet that criterion if the entity's right to retain (and not refund) that payment would be enforceable if the customer terminated the contract.
Furthermore, the boards noted that the right to payment should be enforceable; otherwise, it is questionable whether the entity actually has a right to payment.
This would be the case if the contract or other laws in the jurisdiction require the entity and the customer to complete their respective obligations (often referred to as specific performance).
Right to payment as a separate revenue recognition criterion
BC148 The boards considered but rejected specifying a right to payment as a more overarching criterion in determining when revenue is recognised, for the following reasons
the core revenue recognition principle is about determining whether goods or services have been transferred to a customer, not whether the entity has a right to payment (although it is an important part of determining whether a contract exists — see paragraphs BC31–BC46).
Including a right to payment as an overarching criterion for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied could have potentially overridden that revenue recognition principle.
a right to payment does not necessarily indicate a transfer of goods or services (for example, in some contracts, customers are required to make non-refundable upfront payments and do not receive any goods or services in exchange).
In cases in which the customer clearly receives benefits as the entity performs, as in many service contracts, the possibility that the entity will ultimately not retain the payment for its performance is addressed in the measurement of revenue.
For example, in some service contracts in which the customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as the entity performs, the customer may be able to terminate the contract and receive a full refund of any consideration paid.
The boards decided that in those cases, because the entity is transferring services to the customer, it should recognise revenue subject to an assessment of whether it should constrain the amount of the transaction price to which it is entitled (see paragraphs BC203–BC223).
Agreements for the construction of real estate
BC149 In developing the requirements for assessing when goods or services transfer to the customer, the boards considered the diversity in practice from applying previous revenue recognition requirements in IFRS that were specific to the construction of real estate.
That diversity in practice resulted from the difficulty in determining when control of real estate transferred to the customer over time by applying the previous IFRS revenue recognition criteria to complex contracts with different facts and circumstances.
However, the boards observe that the pattern of transfer may be different for different real estate contracts because it will depend on the relevant facts and circumstances of each contract.
For example, some real estate contracts may result in an asset that cannot (under the terms of the contract) be readily directed to another customer (ie the entity's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity), and the contracts require the customer to pay for performance completed to date (thus meeting the criterion in paragraph 35(c) of IFRS 15).
However, other real estate contracts that create an asset with no alternative use to the entity may not require the customer to pay for performance completed to date.
Therefore, an entity would reach a different conclusion on the pattern of transfer for those contracts.
Other respondents in this industry explained that although they were able to conclude that their performance does not create an asset with an alternative use, they were unable to meet the 'right to payment for performance completed to date' criterion.
This would mean that they would be able to recognise revenue only at the point in time when each unit transfers to the customer (often only after construction is complete and the customer has physical possession), which they stated would be an inappropriate depiction of their performance.
Furthermore, the boards decided that clarifying the 'no alternative use and right to payment for performance completed to date' criterion would ensure greater certainty and consistency in recognising revenue for multi-unit residential real estate developments.
For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer.
The boards included the indicator 'the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset' because of comments from respondents who disagreed with the boards' initial proposal to eliminate considerations of the 'risks and rewards of ownership' from the recognition of revenue.
The boards decided that adding risks and rewards as an indicator provides additional guidance, but does not change the principle of determining the transfer of goods or services on the basis of the transfer of control.
Some respondents also questioned what an entity should do if some but not all of the indicators were present.
As described in paragraphs BC134–BC141, the notion of customer-specific design or function has been developed into the criterion of 'an asset with no alternative use to the entity'.
The boards included application guidance to help an entity assess the transfer of control in circumstances in which put or call options exist in a contract with a customer (see paragraphs BC422–BC433).
Because of the breadth of the scope of IFRS 15, the boards decided that it would not be feasible to consider all possible methods and prescribe when an entity should use each method.
Accordingly, an entity should use judgement when selecting an appropriate method of measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation.
That does not mean that an entity has a 'free choice'.
For example, in a typical health club contract, the entity's promise is to stand ready for a period of time (ie by making the health club available), rather than providing a service only when the customer requires it.
In this case, the customer benefits from the entity's service of making the health club available.
This is evidenced by the fact that the extent to which the customer uses the health club does not, in itself, affect the amount of the remaining goods or services to which the customer is entitled.
In addition, the customer is obliged to pay the consideration regardless of whether it uses the health club.
Consequently, in those cases, the entity would need to select a measure of progress based on its service of making goods or services available, instead of when the customer uses the goods or services made available to them.
An entity should not use different methods to measure its performance in satisfying the same or similar performance obligations, otherwise that entity's revenue would not be comparable in different reporting periods.
Requirements for the application of those methods are included in the application guidance (see paragraphs B14–B19 of IFRS 15).
When applying an output method, 'value to the customer' refers to an objective measure of the entity's performance in the contract.
However, value to the customer is not intended to be assessed by reference to the market prices or stand-alone selling prices of the individual goods or services promised in the contract, nor is it intended to refer to the value that the customer perceives to be embodied in the goods or services.
However, the boards observed that it would be appropriate for an entity to use an input method if that method would be less costly and would provide a reasonable proxy for measuring progress.
BC165 In the redeliberations, some respondents, particularly those in the contract manufacturing industry, requested the boards to provide more guidance on when units-of-delivery or units-of-production methods would be appropriate.
Those respondents observed that such methods appear to be output methods and, therefore, questioned whether they would always provide the most appropriate depiction of an entity's performance.
The boards observed that such methods may be appropriate in some cases; however, they may not always result in the best depiction of an entity's performance if the performance obligation is satisfied over time.
This is because a units-of-delivery or a units-of-production method ignores the work in progress that belongs to the customer.
When that work in progress is material to either the contract or the financial statements as a whole, the boards observed that using a units-of-delivery or a units-of-production method would distort the entity's performance because it would not recognise revenue for the assets that are created before delivery or before production is complete but are controlled by the customer.
However, a units-of-delivery method may be an appropriate method for measuring progress for a long-term manufacturing contract of standard items that individually transfer an equal amount of value to the customer on delivery.
Thus, the boards clarified that in selecting an output method for measuring progress and determining whether a units-of-delivery or a units-of-production method is appropriate, an entity should consider its facts and circumstances and select the method that depicts the entity's performance and the transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer.
This method is appropriate if the amount of consideration that the entity has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the customer of each incremental good or service that the entity transfers to the customer (ie the entity's performance completed to date).
If those goods and services are not distinct, then the entity would have a single performance obligation.
Because there is diversity in practice about how to apply an input method to measure progress in such situations, the boards decided to provide additional guidance related to uninstalled materials.
The boards also observed that if the entity applies a cost-to-cost method of measuring progress (ie costs incurred compared with total expected costs), the entity might (in the absence of clear requirements) include the cost of the goods in the cost-to-cost calculation and, therefore, recognise a contract-wide profit margin for the transfer of the goods.
The boards noted that recognising a contract-wide profit margin before the goods are installed could overstate the measure of the entity's performance and, therefore, revenue would be overstated.
Alternatively, requiring an entity to estimate a profit margin that is different from the contract-wide profit margin could be complex and could effectively create a performance obligation for goods that are not distinct (thus bypassing the requirements for identifying performance obligations).
Therefore, the boards decided that, in specified circumstances, an entity should recognise revenue for the transfer of the goods but only in an amount equal to the cost of those goods.
In those circumstances, an entity should also exclude the costs of the goods from the cost-to-cost calculation to be consistent with the cost-to-cost methodology.
For goods that meet the conditions in paragraph B19(b) of IFRS 15, recognising revenue to the extent of the costs of those goods ensures that the depiction of the entity's profit (or margin) in the contract is similar to the profit (or margin) that the entity would recognise if the customer had supplied those goods themselves for the entity to install or use in the construction activity.
In their view, recognising different profit margins for different parts of a single performance obligation is inconsistent with the principle of identifying performance obligations.
BC175 To be consistent with their decision on uninstalled materials, the boards also clarified that if an entity selects an input method such as cost-to-cost to measure its progress, the entity should adjust the measure of progress if including some of those costs incurred (for example, inefficiencies and wasted materials) would distort the entity's performance in the contract.
This would be the case if the cost-to-cost method includes costs attributable to wasted materials or other inefficiencies that do not contribute to the satisfaction of a performance obligation.
BC177 As part of their redeliberations, the boards considered whether more guidance should be provided on the notions of inefficiency and wasted materials.
For instance, some respondents asked if the assessment should focus on entity-specific inefficiencies or market-driven inefficiencies, and some requested a clear distinction between the accounting for normal expected wasted materials and the accounting for abnormal wasted materials.
Instead, the boards decided to emphasise that the objective of measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is to depict an entity's performance in the contract and therefore a cost-to-cost calculation may require adjustment if some of the costs incurred do not contribute to the progress in the contract.
Some asked whether an entity's inability to measure progress would mean that costs would also be deferred.
Consequently, the boards decided that in those cases, an entity should recognise revenue for the satisfaction of the performance obligation only to the extent of the costs incurred.
Using that approach, an entity allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation at an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.
That allocation determines the amount of revenue that an entity recognises when (or as) it satisfies each performance obligation.
Most respondents supported the allocated transaction price approach.
The boards observed that this alternative would have made accounting for the contract more complex.
In addition, the boards expected that in many cases it would have provided users of financial statements with little additional information, either because the values of goods or services promised are not inherently volatile or because the effect of any volatility that might exist is limited when an entity transfers the goods or services to the customer over a relatively short time.
Paragraphs BC25–BC27 include additional discussion on rejected measurement approaches.
determine the transaction price for the contract;
allocate the transaction price to performance obligations; and
recognise revenue at the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.
Consequently, the objective in determining the transaction price at the end of each reporting period is to predict the total amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled from the contract.
In developing IFRS 15, the boards decided that the transaction price should not be adjusted for the effects of the customer's credit risk (see paragraphs BC259–BC265) unless the contract includes a significant financing component (see paragraphs BC229–BC247).
For example, the transaction price does not include estimates of consideration from the future exercise of options for additional goods or services or from future change orders.
Until the customer exercises the option or agrees to the change order, the entity does not have a right to consideration.
For example, in the healthcare industry, an entity may determine the transaction price based on amounts to which it will be entitled to payment from the patient, insurance companies and/or governmental organisations.
This may also occur in other industries in which an entity receives a payment from a manufacturer as a result of the manufacturer issuing coupons or rebates directly to the entity's customer.
However, it would not include amounts collected on behalf of another party such as some sales taxes and value added taxes in some jurisdictions.
BC188 Determining the transaction price when a customer promises to pay a fixed amount of cash consideration (ie an amount that will not vary) will be simple. However, determining the transaction price may be more difficult in the following cases
the promised amount of consideration is variable (see paragraphs BC189–BC202), which will also require an entity to consider whether it should constrain the estimated amount of consideration to be included in the transaction price (see paragraphs BC203–BC223);
the contract has a significant financing component (see paragraphs BC229–BC247);
the promised amount of consideration is in a form other than cash (see paragraphs BC248–BC254); and
there is consideration payable to the customer by the entity (see paragraphs BC255–BC258).
Entities are therefore required to identify and assess sales taxes to determine whether to include or exclude those taxes from the transaction price.
These stakeholders also stated that the variety of, and changes in, tax laws among jurisdictions contributes to that complexity.
An accounting policy choice to either include or exclude all sales taxes in or from revenue was available in the previous revenue standards under US GAAP.
Taxes assessed on an entity's total gross receipts or imposed during the inventory procurement process are excluded from the scope of the election.
BC188D The IASB decided not to provide a similar accounting policy choice, for the following reasons
Consequently, the boards decided to provide requirements that address
identifying when variable consideration is present in a contract with a customer (see paragraphs BC190–BC194);
the methods for estimating variable consideration (see paragraphs BC195–BC202);
when those estimates of variable consideration should be constrained and, thus, not included in the transaction price (see paragraphs BC203–BC223); and
how to account for subsequent changes in the transaction price (see paragraphs BC224–BC228).
This is because the entity may be entitled to the consideration only upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event.
Consider, for example, a fixed-price service contract in which the customer pays upfront and the terms of the contract provide the customer with a full refund of the amount paid if the customer is dissatisfied with the service at any time.
In those cases, the consideration is variable because the entity might be entitled to all of the consideration or none of the consideration if the customer exercises its right to a refund.
The boards observed that an entity's customary business practices, published policies or specific statements may provide evidence that the entity is willing to accept a lower price in exchange for the promised goods and services.
The boards noted that in many cases, price concessions are likely to be granted to enhance a customer relationship to encourage future sales to that customer.
For example, an entity might enter into a contract with a new customer with a strategy to develop the customer relationship.
In that case, although there may not be past evidence that the entity will provide a price concession, there may be other factors present that result in the entity concluding that it will accept a lower price than that stated in the contract.
The boards noted that an entity should use judgement and consider all relevant facts and circumstances in making that determination.
The boards observed that this judgement was being applied under previous revenue recognition requirements.
Consequently, the boards decided not to develop detailed requirements for differentiating between a price concession and impairment losses.
The method for estimating the variable consideration
That exposure draft proposed that when the consideration in a contract is variable, an entity should measure the transaction price (at its expected value) using only a probability-weighted method.
A probability-weighted method reflects the full range of possible consideration amounts, weighted by their respective probabilities.
add complexity and be costly to apply; and
impede the reporting of meaningful results in all circumstances because, for example, it could result in an entity determining the transaction price at an amount of consideration that the entity could never obtain under the contract.
BC197 Some respondents suggested that the boards not specify a measurement model and, instead, require that the transaction price be determined using management's best estimate.
Furthermore, without such a framework, the measurement of revenue might not be understandable to users of financial statements and might lack comparability between entities.
They noted that a probability-weighted method reflects all of the uncertainties existing in the transaction price at the end of the reporting period.
Therefore, it best reflects the conditions that are present at the end of each reporting period.
For instance, it reflects the possibility of receiving a greater amount of consideration as well as the risk of receiving a lesser amount.
However, the boards observed that users of financial statements are most interested in knowing the total amount of consideration that will ultimately be realised from the contract.
Consequently, the boards decided that for the estimate of the transaction price to be meaningful at the end of each reporting period, it should be an amount that the entity expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled (the boards decided to address the issue of credit risk separately — see paragraphs BC259–BC265).
For example, that is likely to be the case if the entity has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics.
However, the boards agreed with respondents that an expected value may not always faithfully predict the consideration to which an entity will be entitled.
The boards decided that in those cases, another method — the most likely amount method — is necessary to estimate the transaction price.
This is because the most likely amount method identifies the individual amount of consideration in the range of possible consideration amounts that is more likely to occur than any other individual outcome.
Similarly, in practice, estimating the expected value using a probability-weighted method does not require an entity to consider all possible outcomes using complex models and techniques, even if an entity has extensive data and can identify many outcomes.
In many cases, a limited number of discrete outcomes and probabilities can often provide a reasonable estimate of the distribution of possible outcomes.
This would be the case if the estimate of variable consideration (and consequently the amount of revenue recognised) is too uncertain and, therefore, may not faithfully depict the consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services transferred to the customer.
In that case, the boards decided that an entity should constrain the estimate of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price.
However, the boards noted that their intention was not to eliminate the use of estimates, which are commonplace and necessary in financial reporting, but instead to ensure that those estimates are robust and result in useful information.
This is because revenue is an important metric and users of financial statements explained that it is critical that those estimates of variable consideration be included in revenue only when there is a high degree of confidence that revenue will not be reversed in a subsequent reporting period.
the objective of constraining estimates of variable consideration and specifying a level of confidence (see paragraphs BC206–BC213);
application of the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration and sales-based and usage-based royalties on licences of intellectual property (see paragraphs BC214–BC219); and
The objective of constraining estimates of variable consideration and specifying a level of confidence
In making their decision, the boards considered the feedback received from users of financial statements.
The majority of users of financial statements that were consulted indicated that the most relevant measure for revenue in a reporting period would be one that will not result in a significant reversal in a subsequent period.
This is because an amount that would not reverse in the future would help users of financial statements better predict future revenues of an entity.
Specifically, the boards decided that an entity should include some or all of an estimate of variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur.
This is because the boards' decision introduces a downward bias into estimates that will be included in the transaction price.
However, the boards decided that this bias was reasonable because users of financial statements indicated that revenue is more relevant if it is not expected to be subject to significant future reversals.
BC208 In the redeliberations, preparers and auditors indicated that meeting the objective of constraining estimates of variable consideration would be difficult if no level of confidence was specified, for instance, if the boards merely specified that an entity should include variable consideration to the extent that it expects that doing so would not result in a significant revenue reversal.
Many also observed that omitting a level of confidence from the objective could result in diversity in practice if entities interpreted the implicit confidence level in different ways (for example, some might interpret the implicit confidence level as virtually certain while others might presume it to mean more likely than not).
Those respondents observed that the term is used elsewhere in IFRS, US GAAP and auditing requirements and further noted that its meaning is often interpreted differently in those contexts.
Consequently, the boards decided that the most appropriate level of confidence would be 'highly probable' for IFRS and 'probable' for US GAAP as a result of the usage of those terms in existing requirements.
Therefore, to achieve the same meaning in IFRS as US GAAP, the boards decided to use the term 'highly probable' for IFRS purposes and 'probable' for US GAAP purposes.
The boards noted that this is consistent with the approach that the IASB adopted in developing IFRS 5, for which the IASB used the term 'highly probable' to achieve the same meaning as 'probable' in US GAAP (see paragraph BC81 of IFRS 5).
In other words, the boards did not expect that an entity would need to prepare a quantitative analysis each time it assessed the likelihood of whether a significant revenue reversal could occur.
Therefore, the boards concluded that including a confidence level would not result in application of the requirements that is too costly or complex.
This is because the boards observed that a practice of offering a broad range of price concessions would increase the probability that a significant revenue reversal would occur if the entity included the contractual amount of consideration in the transaction price.
Application of the requirements to constrain estimates of variable consideration
If the entity determines that it is highly probable that the inclusion of its estimate will not result in a significant revenue reversal, that amount is included in the transaction price.
This is because the boards did not intend for an entity to inappropriately recognise revenue by offsetting the risk of a future revenue reversal for a satisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligation against expected revenue from future performance.
For example, if the consideration for a single performance obligation included a fixed amount and a variable amount, the entity would assess the magnitude of a possible revenue reversal of the variable amount relative to the total consideration (ie variable and fixed consideration).
This is because the objective of constraining estimates of variable consideration is focused on a possible revenue reversal of the amount of cumulative revenue recognised for a performance obligation, rather than on a reversal of only the variable consideration allocated to that performance obligation.
However, the entity might determine that it is highly probable that including some of the estimate of the variable consideration in the transaction price would not result in a significant revenue reversal.
The boards decided that, in such cases, the entity should include that amount in the estimate of the transaction price.
BC219 However, the boards decided that for a licence of intellectual property for which the consideration is based on the customer's subsequent sales or usage, an entity should not recognise any revenue for the uncertain amounts until the uncertainty is resolved (ie when the customer's subsequent sales or usage occurs).
The boards included these requirements because both users and preparers of financial statements generally indicated that if an entity recognised a minimum amount of revenue for those contracts it would not provide relevant information (see paragraphs BC419–BC421).
BC220 During the development of the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration, the boards considered where in the revenue recognition model it would be most appropriate to apply those requirements.
However, the boards observed that those are not truly independent objectives because the measurement of revenue determines the amount of revenue recognised.
In other words, the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration restrict revenue recognition and use measurement uncertainty as the basis for determining if (or how much) revenue should be recognised.
The boards noted that applying the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration to the transaction price or to the cumulative amount of revenue recognised should have an equal effect on the amount of revenue recognised in a contract.
In many of the contracts in those industries, when a portion of the variable consideration becomes fixed, it relates only to the performance for the period.
The boards observed that the requirements for allocating variable consideration (see paragraphs BC284–BC293) would ensure that the revenue recognised would faithfully depict the performance in such a contract.
Subsequent changes in the transaction price
BC224 After contract inception, an entity will revise its expectations about the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled as uncertainties are resolved or as new information about remaining uncertainties becomes available.
To depict conditions that exist at the end of each reporting period (and changes in conditions during the reporting period), the boards decided that an entity should update its estimate of the transaction price throughout the contract.
The boards concluded that reflecting current assessments of the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled will provide more useful information to users of financial statements than retaining the initial estimates, especially for long-term contracts that are subject to significant changes in conditions during the life of the contract.
recognise those changes in profit or loss when the changes occur; or
allocate those changes to performance obligations.
In the boards' view, that alternative could have resulted in a pattern of revenue recognition that would not faithfully depict the pattern of the transfer of goods or services.
Moreover, recognising revenue immediately (and entirely) for a change in the estimate of the transaction price would have been prone to abuse in practice.
The boards considered whether changes in the estimate of the transaction price could be presented as a gain or loss separately from revenue, thus preserving the pattern of revenue recognition.
However, the boards rejected that alternative because the total amount of revenue recognised for the contract would not have equalled the amount of consideration to which the entity was entitled under the contract.
This is because the cumulative revenue recognised will then depict the revenue that the entity would have recognised at the end of the subsequent reporting period, if the entity had the information at contract inception.
Consequently, the transaction price that is allocated to performance obligations that have already been satisfied should be recognised as revenue (or as a reduction of revenue) immediately.
However, information relating to the variable consideration might arise between the end of the reporting period and the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
The financing component may be explicitly identified in the contract or may be implied by the contractual payment terms of the contract.
The boards decided to require an entity to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of financing components if those financing components are significant, for the following reasons
not recognising a financing component could misrepresent the revenue of a contract.
For example, if a customer pays in arrears, ignoring the financing component of the contract would result in full revenue recognition on the transfer of the good or service, despite the fact that the entity is providing a service of financing to the customer.
in some contracts, entities (or customers) consider the timing of the cash flows in a contract.
Consequently, identifying a significant financing component acknowledges an important economic feature of the contract, which is that the contract includes a financing arrangement as well as the transfer of goods or services.
A contract in which the customer pays for a good or service when that good or service is transferred to the customer may be significantly different from a contract in which the customer pays before or after the good or service is transferred in order to provide or receive a financing benefit.
BC230 The objective of adjusting the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component is to reflect, in the amount of revenue recognised, the 'cash selling price' of the underlying good or service at the time that the good or service is transferred.
The boards observed that adjusting the promised consideration to obtain the cash selling price may only be required when the timing of payments specified in the contract provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer.
This is because, in other cases, the timing of payments may be for a purpose other than financing, such as protection for non-performance.
This is described further in the following paragraphs.
Determining whether a contract includes a significant financing component
However, a number of respondents explained that this might have required an entity to adjust for the time value of money when the parties did not contemplate a financing arrangement as part of the negotiated terms of the contract.
Those respondents explained that, in some cases, although there is a significant period of time between the transfer of the goods or services and the payment, the reason for that timing difference is not related to a financing arrangement between the entity and the customer.
BC232 The boards also decided to remove the term 'time value of money' from the discussion about adjustments for financing components, to reflect their decision that the focus is on whether the payment terms provide the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing.
This is because the term 'time value of money' is a broader economic term that may suggest that it is necessary to adjust the promised amount of consideration in circumstances other than when the cash sales price may differ from the contractual payments.
Those factors require evaluation of
the difference, if any, between the amount of promised consideration and the cash selling price of the promised goods or services.
If the entity (or another entity) sells the same good or service for a different amount of consideration depending on the timing of the payment terms, this generally provides observable data that the parties are aware that there is a financing component in the contract.
This factor is presented as an indicator because in some cases the difference between the cash selling price and the consideration promised by the customer is due to factors other than financing (see paragraph BC233).
Although the boards decided that the difference in timing between the transfer of goods and services and payment for those goods and services is not determinative, the combined effect of timing and the prevailing interest rates may provide a strong indication that a significant benefit of financing is being provided.
the customer has paid for the goods or services in advance and, the timing of the transfer of those goods or services is at the discretion of the customer.
The boards noted that for some types of goods or services, such as prepaid phone cards and customer loyalty points, the customer will pay for those goods or services in advance and the transfer of those goods or services to the customer is at the customer's discretion.
The boards expected that, in those cases, the purpose of the payment terms is not related to a financing arrangement between the parties.
In addition, the boards decided that the costs of requiring an entity to account for the time value of money in these cases would outweigh any perceived benefit because the entity would need to continually estimate when the goods or services will transfer to the customer.
a substantial amount of the consideration promised by the customer is variable and that consideration varies on the basis of factors that are outside the control of the customer or the entity.
The boards observed that for some arrangements, the primary purpose of the specified timing or amount of the payment terms might not be to provide the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing but, instead, to resolve uncertainties that relate to the consideration for the goods or services.
For example, in a royalty arrangement, the entity and the customer might not be willing to fix the price and timing of payment because there are significant uncertainties about the goods or services.
The primary purpose of those payment terms may be to provide the parties with assurance of the value of the goods or services rather than to provide significant financing to the customer.
the difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price of the good or service arises for reasons other than the provision of financing to either the customer or the entity.
In some circumstances, a payment in advance or in arrears in accordance with the typical payment terms of an industry or jurisdiction may have a primary purpose other than financing.
For example, a customer may retain or withhold some consideration that is payable only on successful completion of the contract or on achievement of a specified milestone.
Alternatively, the customer might be required to pay some consideration upfront to secure a future supply of limited goods or services.
The primary purpose of those payment terms may be to provide the customer with assurance that the entity will complete its obligations satisfactorily under the contract, rather than to provide financing to the customer or the entity respectively.
In other words, for those contracts, the financing component will not be significant.
During their redeliberations, the boards clarified that an entity should consider only the significance of a financing component at a contract level rather than consider whether the financing is material at a portfolio level.
The boards decided that it would have been unduly burdensome to require an entity to account for a financing component if the effects of the financing component were not material to the individual contract, but the combined effects for a portfolio of similar contracts were material to the entity as a whole.
Practical reliefs from the significant financing component requirements
The boards observed that, as with the other practical expedients in IFRS 15, an entity should apply the practical expedient consistently to similar contracts in similar circumstances.
This is because an entity would not be required to
conclude whether those contracts contain the attributes of a financing component that are significant to those contracts (see paragraph BC232); and
determine the interest rate that is implicit within those contracts.
Those respondents commented that accounting for any effects of a significant financing component arising from advance payments would result in the following
change previous practices in which entities typically did not recognise the effects of the financing implicit in advance payments;
not reflect the economics of the arrangement when the customer pays in advance for reasons other than financing (for example, the customer has significant credit risk or is compensating the entity for incurring upfront contract costs).
This is because ignoring the effects of advance payments could substantially skew the amount and pattern of profit recognition if the advance payment is significant and the primary purpose of that payment is to provide financing to the entity.
Consider the example in which an entity requires a customer to pay in advance for a long-term construction contract, because the entity requires financing to obtain materials for the contract.
BC239 The boards considered whether the discount rate used to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component should be a risk-free rate or a risk-adjusted rate.
A risk-free rate would have been observable and simple to apply in many jurisdictions and it would have avoided the costs of determining a rate specific to each contract.
However, the boards decided that using a risk-free rate would not result in useful information, because the resulting interest rate would not have reflected the characteristics of the parties to the contract.
In addition, the boards noted that it would not necessarily have been appropriate to use any rate explicitly specified in the contract because the entity might offer 'cheap' financing as a marketing incentive and, therefore, using that rate would not have resulted in an appropriate recognition of profit over the life of the contract.
Consequently, the boards decided that an entity should apply the rate used in a financing transaction between the entity and its customer that does not involve the provision of goods or services because that rate reflects the characteristics of the party receiving financing in the contract.
That rate also reflects the customer's creditworthiness, among other risks.
In addition, it would have been impractical for entities with large volumes of customer contracts to determine a discount rate specifically for each individual customer.
The boards expect that in those remaining contracts in which an entity is required to account separately for the financing component, the entity and its customer will typically negotiate the contractual payment terms separately after considering factors such as inflation rates and the customer's credit risk.
Therefore, an entity should have access to sufficient information to determine the discount rate that would be used in a separate financing between the entity and the customer.
Re-evaluating the discount rate used for a significant financing component
They also observed that it would be impractical for an entity to update the transaction price for changes in the assessment of the discount rate.
Presentation of the effect of a significant financing component
The boards decided that impairment losses on short-term trade receivables (ie receivables arising from contracts with customers that do not have separately identified financing components) should be presented in the statement of comprehensive income in a consistent manner with impairment losses on long-term trade receivables (see paragraphs BC259–BC265).
BC248 When an entity receives cash from a customer in exchange for a good or service, the transaction price and, therefore, the amount of revenue, should be the amount of cash received (ie the value of the inbound asset).
To be consistent with that approach, the boards decided that an entity should measure non-cash consideration at fair value.
The non-cash consideration could be in the form of goods or services, but it may also be in the form of a financial instrument or property, plant and equipment.
For example, an entity might receive an electrical substation in exchange for connecting houses in a new residential development to the electricity network.
That approach is consistent both with requirements in previous revenue Standards in IFRS and with requirements for other situations in which the fair value of the assets surrendered in exchange for assets received may be estimated more reliably.
For example, an entity's entitlement to a bonus that will be received in non-cash consideration may also depend on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event.
That is, the fair value could vary because of changes in the price or value of the non-cash consideration, such as a change in the price per share.
Consequently, the boards decided to constrain variability in the estimate of the fair value of the non-cash consideration if that variability relates to changes in the fair value for reasons other than the form of the consideration (ie for reasons other than changes in the price of the non-cash consideration).
For example, if an entity is entitled to a performance bonus that is payable in the form of non-cash consideration, the entity would apply the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration to the uncertainty of whether the entity will receive the bonus, because that uncertainty is related to something other than the form of the consideration (ie the entity's performance).
The boards observed that this principle is not that different from previous revenue recognition requirements under US GAAP for changes in the fair value of equity instruments that are granted as consideration in exchange for goods or services, although those requirements differentiated between the variability on the basis of performance conditions and market conditions (which were defined terms in those requirements).
Those previous requirements provided detailed guidance for the measurement and recognition of revenue when the consideration was in the form of shares or share options.
However, the FASB decided to remove those requirements because equity instruments are merely another form of non-cash consideration.
Therefore, equity instruments received as promised consideration in a contract with a customer would be accounted for consistently with other forms of non-cash consideration.
Date of measurement of non-cash consideration
Accordingly, the IASB decided that, if needed, issues relating to the measurement of non-cash consideration should be considered more comprehensively in a separate project.
The FASB also expects this approach to be typically less costly and less complex to apply in practice than other alternatives.
BC254E The IASB acknowledged that, because it has concluded that a change equivalent to that decided by the FASB is not needed, the use of a measurement date other than contract inception would not be precluded under IFRS.
Consequently, it is possible that diversity between IFRS and US GAAP entities could arise in practice.
The IASB observed that, unlike US GAAP, existing IFRS does not contain any specific requirements about the measurement date for non-cash consideration for revenue transactions.
In addition, discussions with some stakeholders highlighted that any practical effect of different measurement dates would arise in only limited circumstances.
Application of the variable consideration constraint to changes in fair value of non-cash consideration
In particular, some stakeholders are concerned that bifurcating the effects of variability might be challenging in some circumstances.
The FASB observed that applying the variable consideration requirements to both types of variability might not provide users of financial statements with useful information, because the timing of revenue recognition might differ for similar transactions settled in different forms of consideration (for example, cash and shares).
Additionally, the inclusion of a minor performance condition could significantly affect the amount of non-cash consideration that would be subject to the constraint on variable consideration.
BC254H The IASB noted that paragraph BC252 explains that the boards decided to constrain variability in the estimate of the fair value of the non-cash consideration if that variability relates to changes in the fair value for reasons other than the form of the consideration (ie for reasons other than changes in the price of the non-cash consideration).
The IASB also noted the view of some TRG members that in practice it might be difficult to distinguish between variability in the fair value due to the form of the consideration and other reasons, in which case applying the variable consideration constraint to the whole of the estimate of the non-cash consideration might be more practical.
Consequently, the IASB acknowledged that differences may arise between an entity reporting under IFRS and an entity reporting under US GAAP.
That consideration might be in the form of a payment in exchange for goods or services received from the customer, a discount or refund for goods or services provided to the customer, or a combination of both.
For instance, a customer may pay more for goods or services from an entity than it would otherwise have paid if it was not receiving a payment from the entity.
Consequently, the boards decided that to depict revenue faithfully in those cases, any amount accounted for as a payment to the customer for goods or services received should be limited to the fair value of those goods or services, with any amount in excess of the fair value being recognised as a reduction of the transaction price.
However, in some cases, an entity promises to pay consideration to a customer only after it has satisfied its performance obligations and, therefore, after it has recognised revenue.
When this is the case, a reduction in revenue should be recognised immediately.
Accordingly, the boards clarified that the reduction of revenue is recognised at the later of when the entity transfers the goods or services to the customer and when the entity promises to pay the consideration.
By using the phrase 'promises to pay', the boards clarified that an entity should reflect in the transaction price payments to customers that are conditional on future events (for example, a promise to pay a customer that is conditional on the customer making a specified number of purchases would be reflected in the transaction price when the entity makes the promise).
In other words, the customer's credit risk would be reflected in the measurement of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations in the contract.
Although some respondents agreed with the proposal that the transaction price should reflect the customer's credit risk, nearly all respondents (including preparers, users of financial statements and securities regulators) expressed concerns about applying that concept in practice.
In particular, many users of financial statements commented that they would prefer revenue to be measured at the 'gross' amount so that revenue growth and receivables management (or bad debts) could be analysed separately.
Those users of financial statements indicated that they were interested in assessing the performance of an entity's sales function and receivables collection function separately because those functions are often managed separately.
However, that information would not be available if an entity's assessment of sales and collectability were reflected only on a 'net' basis in the revenue line.
BC261 After considering that feedback, the boards decided not to adopt that proposal.
However, to provide transparency to all users of financial statements for the portion of the entity's gross revenue that is expected to be uncollectable, the boards proposed to link the presentation of the revenue line and the impairment loss line.
different interpretations might have emerged about whether the reported revenue amount of the entity is the gross revenue before the impairment losses that are presented adjacent to revenue or the net revenue after those impairment losses.
the impairment losses that would have been presented as a separate line item adjacent to the revenue line item might have related to uncollectable consideration that had been recognised as revenue in previous reporting periods.
Consequently, there would not necessarily be a connection between the revenue recognised in a particular reporting period and the impairment losses that would have been presented adjacent to the revenue line item in that period.
the impairment losses on short-term trade receivables (ie receivables arising from contracts with customers that do not have separately identified financing components) would have been presented differently from all other financial assets that are subject to impairment.
This is because the impairment losses for short-term trade receivables would have been presented adjacent to revenue, whereas for all other financial assets, impairment losses would have been presented together with other expense items in the statement of comprehensive income.
For the reasons described in paragraphs BC244–BC247, those other financial assets would have included receivables arising from contracts with customers that include a financing component that is significant to the contract.
The boards observed that this approach would have provided a clearer link between revenue and the impairment losses related to the revenue recognised in that period.
However, many respondents noted that it would have been challenging to distinguish between initial and subsequent impairment losses without incurring significant costs to obtain the information.
BC264 Consequently, the boards decided to modify the presentation requirements for impairment losses and to require disclosure of impairment losses on short-term trade receivables arising from a contract with a customer separate from other impairment losses (if not otherwise presented and subject to the usual materiality considerations).
Furthermore, the boards noted that this would provide greater consistency with the accounting for impairment losses on contracts with customers that include a significant financing component.
The boards decided that in those cases, 'grossing up' revenue and recognising a significant impairment loss would not faithfully represent the transaction and would not provide useful information.
They decided that in most cases an allocation based on stand-alone selling prices faithfully depicts the different margins that may apply to promised goods or services.
Some of those respondents observed that the requirements were broadly consistent with previous changes to US GAAP for multiple-element arrangements.
However, respondents expressed concerns about the following topics
estimating the stand-alone selling price; and
allocating discounts and contingent consideration.
However, the boards decided not to preclude or prescribe any particular method for estimating a stand-alone selling price so long as the estimate is a faithful representation of the price at which the entity would sell the distinct good or service if it were sold separately to the customer.
The boards clarified that the method used by the entity to estimate a stand-alone selling price should maximise the use of observable inputs and should be applied consistently to estimate the stand-alone selling price of other goods or services with similar characteristics.
BC269 The boards observed that many entities may already have robust processes for determining stand-alone selling prices on the basis of reasonably available data points and the effects of market considerations and entity-specific factors.
However, other entities may need to develop processes for estimating selling prices of goods or services that are typically not sold separately.
The boards decided that when developing those processes, an entity should consider all reasonably available information on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances.
market conditions (for example, supply and demand for the good or service in the market, competition, restrictions and trends);
entity-specific factors (for example, business pricing strategies and practices); and
information about the customer or class of customer (for example, type of customer, geographical region and distribution channel).
BC270 In response to questions from respondents, the boards decided to specify that a residual approach might be a suitable technique for estimating the stand-alone selling price of a good or service.
Using a residual approach, an entity would estimate a stand-alone selling price of a good or service on the basis of the difference between the total transaction price and the (observable) stand-alone selling prices of other goods or services in the contract.
In specifying those circumstances, the boards were particularly mindful of the challenges in determining stand-alone selling prices in contracts for intellectual property and other intangible products.
In those arrangements, the pricing can be highly variable because there is little or no incremental cost to the entity in providing those goods or services to a customer.
In those circumstances, the most reliable way of determining the stand-alone selling price in the contract will often be to use a residual approach.
For the same reason, the boards noted that the residual approach might be appropriate in situations in which an entity has not yet established the selling price for a good or service that previously has not been sold on a stand-alone basis.
apply the residual approach to estimate the aggregate of the stand-alone selling prices for all the promised goods or services with highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices; and
then use another technique to estimate the stand-alone selling prices of each of those promised goods or services with highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices.
Specifying a hierarchy of evidence
BC274 The boards decided not to specify a hierarchy of evidence to determine the stand-alone selling price of a good or service. Instead, they decided to emphasise that an entity should maximise the use of observable inputs when developing estimates of stand-alone selling prices.
However, some respondents recommended that the boards should specify a hierarchy of evidence, because specifying a hierarchy of evidence for determining stand-alone selling prices (and requiring disclosures using that hierarchy) would enhance the quality and reliability of an entity's reported revenues.
The hierarchy suggested by those respondents was similar to that in previous revenue Standards
It is only when a good or service is not sold separately that an entity is required to estimate the stand-alone selling price.
In that estimation process, an entity is still required to maximise the use of observable inputs.
Some respondents noted that this would not always faithfully depict the amount of consideration to which an entity is entitled for satisfying a particular performance obligation.
They suggested that the boards should permit an entity to allocate the discount in a contract using one of the following alternatives
a management approach, in which an entity would assess which promised good or service is priced at a discount to its stand-alone selling price.
a residual approach, in which any discount in the contract would be allocated entirely to the satisfied performance obligations.
a profit margin approach, in which an entity would allocate the discount in a contract in proportion to the individual profit margin on each performance obligation.
The individual profit margin for each performance obligation is the difference between the stand-alone selling price and the direct costs of the good or service underlying each performance obligation.
BC278 Another consequence of allocating the transaction price on a relative stand-alone selling price basis is that any amount of consideration that is variable will be allocated to each of the performance obligations in the contract.
Some respondents noted that this allocation will not always faithfully depict the amount of consideration to which an entity is entitled upon satisfying a particular performance obligation, if the variable consideration does not relate to all of the performance obligations in the contract.
The relative stand-alone selling price basis allocation is simply a method to achieve that objective rather than being the allocation principle.
BC280 However, the boards also noted that allocating the transaction price on a relative stand-alone selling price basis brings rigour and discipline to the process of allocating the transaction price and, therefore, enhances comparability both within an entity and across entities.
Consequently, the boards decided that it should be the default method for allocating the transaction price.
However, they agreed with respondents that it might not always result in a faithful depiction of the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled from the customer.
However, the boards noted that the requirements are included to maintain the rigour and discipline of a stand-alone selling price allocation and, thus, appropriately restrict the situations in which a discount should not be allocated pro rata to all performance obligations in the contract.
In that example, it might be inappropriate to attribute variable consideration included in the transaction price to both products.
That variable amount might be excluded from the estimate of the transaction price (ie because of the requirements for constraining estimates of the transaction price).
In that case, it might be inappropriate to attribute the fixed consideration included in the transaction price to both products.
The boards decided that those criteria are necessary to ensure an appropriate allocation of the transaction price when there is variable consideration in the transaction price.
Those respondents (primarily from the telecommunications and cable television industries) disagreed because allocating the transaction price using relative stand-alone selling prices on a contract-by-contract basis could be complex and costly for their industries.
This is because entities in those industries
have a high volume of contracts with various potential configurations;
provide multiple goods and services in those contracts;
include a discount in the contracts; and
provide the goods or services at different times.
Those requirements were previously used by many telecommunications entities applying US GAAP and IFRS.
In the respondents' view, carrying forward those requirements would have simplified the application of the revenue recognition model by limiting the amount of consideration that a telecommunications entity could allocate to a handset that is bundled with network services to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of network services in the future.
Consequently, revenue would have been recognised at the amount that the customer paid for the handset at contract inception when the handset was transferred to the customer.
The remaining contractual payments would have been recognised subsequently as revenue as the entity provided network services to the customer.
Many users of financial statements of entities in the telecommunications industry agreed that this revenue recognition pattern would have been useful because it closely relates to the timing of cash received.
In their view, this is inappropriate because it will not be useful to users of their financial statements and, in a separate objection, because they will be entitled to collect the excess only when they provide the network services.
Consequently, they reasoned that the contract asset that will result from recognising revenue for delivery of the handset will not meet the definition of an asset.
In addition, they suggested that without a contingent revenue cap, the model will be complex and costly to apply because of the high volume of contracts that they will have to manage and the various potential configurations of handsets and network service plans.
This is because revenue recognised would not depict the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for the delivered good or service.
Consequently, the contingent revenue cap could result in economically similar contracts being accounted for differently.
the contingent revenue cap can result in the recognition of losses if the contract is profitable.
However, costs relating to a good or service already transferred to a customer would not give rise to an asset.
recognising a contract asset in the situation described in paragraph BC290 is appropriate because the entity has a valuable contractual right as a result of satisfying a performance obligation and that right meets the definition of an asset.
That right exists even if the entity does not have the unconditional right to collect consideration from the customer.
applying the contingent cap more broadly than it was applied in previous revenue Standards could have had far-reaching consequences.
For example, in many service contracts (including construction contracts), it is appropriate to recognise revenue when services are provided even though the amount of consideration is contingent on the entity's future performance.
Otherwise, the entity would not recognise any revenue until reaching a contract milestone or potentially until completion of the contract (which would not depict the transfer of goods or services to the customer).
although the consequences for construction and other service contracts could have been reduced by limiting the amount allocated to satisfied performance obligations (rather than limiting the amount allocated to a satisfied portion of a single performance obligation), the boards decided that this would have created an arbitrary distinction and would have put additional pressure on the criteria for identifying performance obligations.
For example, in some contracts for the sale of a handset and network services, either the contract was not cancellable or, if it was, the customer was obliged to pay a termination fee that corresponded with the value of the handset that was delivered upfront (even if the entity might choose not to enforce payment of that fee).
BC292 In addition, the boards decided not to introduce an exception to the revenue recognition model for telecommunications and similar contracts because they do not view those contracts as being different from other contracts in which an entity transfers a bundle of goods or services.
The boards considered whether they should provide more specific guidance as to when an entity could use a portfolio approach for allocating the transaction price.
However, the boards decided not to do so because they were concerned that any further guidance (for example, by including criteria that an entity would need to meet to apply a portfolio approach) might make the practical expedient less useful across entities or jurisdictions.
In those proposals, the boards concluded that an onerous test was needed because the initial measurements of performance obligations are not routinely updated.
In addition, the boards noted that including an onerous test would achieve greater convergence of IFRS and US GAAP.
Furthermore, many explained that strict application of the onerous test would have resulted in recognition of liabilities in cases in which the outcome of fulfilling a single performance obligation was onerous but the outcome of fulfilling the entire contract would be profitable.
A number of respondents suggested removing the onerous test from the revenue proposals because, in addition to being complex and difficult to apply, the requirements for recognition of onerous losses are already sufficiently addressed in other Standards.
Furthermore, the boards noted that although their existing requirements for onerous contracts are not identical, they are not aware of any pressing practice issues resulting from the application of those existing requirements.
Instead, entities applying IFRS or US GAAP will use their respective existing requirements for the identification and measurement of onerous contracts.
BC297 The boards decided that an entity should recognise as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the entity expects to recover those costs.
The boards defined the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as the costs that an entity incurs in its efforts to obtain a contract that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained.
The boards acknowledged that, in some cases, an entity's efforts to recognise an asset from incremental acquisition costs might exceed the financial reporting benefits.
The boards observed that, conceptually, an entity may obtain a contract asset as a result of its efforts to obtain a contract (because the measure of the remaining rights might exceed the measure of the remaining obligations).
BC299 Many respondents disagreed with recognising all costs to obtain a contract as expenses when incurred because those costs meet the definition of an asset in some cases.
In addition, they noted the following
other Standards require some of the costs of obtaining a contract to be included in the carrying amount of an asset on initial recognition; and
the recognition of the costs of obtaining a contract as expenses would be inconsistent with the tentative decisions in the boards' projects on leases and insurance contracts.
For example, the boards observed that recognising the full amount of a sales commission as an expense at inception of a long-term service contract (when that sales commission is reflected in the pricing of that contract and is expected to be recovered) would fail to acknowledge the existence of an asset.
To limit the acquisition costs to those that can be clearly identified as relating specifically to a contract, the boards decided that only the incremental costs of obtaining a contract should be included in the measurement of the asset, if the entity expects to recover those costs.
The boards decided that determining whether other costs relate to a contract is too subjective.
The boards considered whether to allow an accounting policy election for contract costs, under which an entity would have been able to choose to recognise an asset from the acquisition costs or recognise those costs as an expense (with disclosure of the accounting policy election).
The boards noted that this would have been consistent with previous revenue recognition requirements in US GAAP for public entities.
Consequently, the boards decided not to allow entities an accounting policy election with respect to contract acquisition costs.
The FASB observed that it had not intended the application of the cost requirements to result in an outcome for these specific types of sales commissions that would be different from applying existing US GAAP.
Those requirements were developed in response to concerns that the proposals in the Discussion Paper focused on how an entity should recognise revenue in a contract without considering how the entity should account for the costs to fulfil a contract.
Some respondents, particularly those from the construction industry, said that requirements for profit margin recognition are as important as requirements for revenue recognition.
Other respondents, mainly preparers who apply US GAAP, were concerned about the withdrawal of requirements for costs that were developed specifically for their own industries.
improve current practice — the cost requirements provide clearer requirements for accounting for some costs to fulfil a contract (for example, setup costs for services) and result in an entity no longer having to rely on, or analogise to, requirements that were not developed specifically for contracts with customers.
Specifying clear requirements will also result in greater consistency in practice.
promote convergence in accounting for contract costs — more costs will be accounted for similarly under IFRS and US GAAP (although total consistency in accounting for costs to fulfil a contract will not be achieved unless the boards align their respective Standards on inventories; property, plant and equipment; intangible assets and impairment of assets).
Some respondents recommended that the boards address cost requirements comprehensively in a separate project.
However, because cost requirements are included in many Standards (such as the ones described in paragraph BC305(c)), the boards noted that this would require reconsideration of those Standards and, therefore, decided against broadening the scope of the cost requirements.
Those requirements ensure that only costs that meet the definition of an asset are recognised as such and that an entity is precluded from deferring costs merely to normalise profit margins throughout a contract by allocating revenue and costs evenly over the life of the contract.
To provide a clear objective for recognising and measuring an asset arising from the costs to fulfil a contract, the boards decided that only costs that relate directly to a contract should be included in the cost of the asset.
Respondents broadly agreed; however, some asked the boards to clarify whether those goods or services could relate to future contracts.
That conclusion is consistent with the notion of amortising an asset over its useful life and with other Standards.
However, amortising the asset over a longer period than the initial contract would not be appropriate in situations in which an entity pays a commission on a contract renewal that is commensurate with the commission paid on the initial contract.
In that case, the acquisition costs from the initial contract do not relate to the subsequent contract.
However, the boards decided that an entity should consider only the economic benefits in the contract with the customer and, consequently, the impairment test should be based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the remaining amount of promised consideration in exchange for the goods or services to which the asset relates, less the remaining costs of providing those goods or services.
The boards decided that for purposes of impairment testing, the entity should consider future cash flows that may be too uncertain to include in the recognition of revenue (see paragraphs BC203–BC223).
The boards decided this because their objective for measuring and recognising impairments of contract acquisition and fulfilment costs is different from the measurement objective for revenue.
The impairment objective is to determine whether the carrying amount of the contract acquisition and fulfilment costs asset is recoverable.
Consequently, the measurement objective is consistent with other impairment methods in IFRS and US GAAP that include an assessment of customer credit risk and expectations of whether amounts of variable consideration will be received.
Conversely, the IASB decided that the impairment charge should be reversed in those circumstances under IFRS.
The boards acknowledged that this would result in entities accounting differently for those contract costs using IFRS and US GAAP.
However, the boards decided that it is important for the requirements to be consistent with their respective impairment models for other types of assets and those impairment models differ in their accounting for reversals of impairments.
BC312 A 'learning curve' is the effect of efficiencies realised over time when an entity's costs of performing a task (or producing a unit) decline in relation to how many times the entity performs that task (or produces that unit).
The phenomenon of a learning curve can exist independently of a contract with a customer.
For example, a typical manufacturer that produces units of inventory would become more efficient in its production process over time.
Some respondents asked how to apply the proposals to account for the effects of learning costs in a contract with a customer.
an entity has a single performance obligation to deliver a specified number of units; and
the performance obligation is satisfied over time.
BC315 In other situations, an entity may promise to deliver a specified number of units in a contract, but that promise does not give rise to a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time.
The boards decided that, in those situations, an entity should apply the requirements of other Standards (for example, IAS 2) for the following reasons
if an entity incurs costs to fulfil a contract without also satisfying a performance obligation over time, the entity probably would be creating an asset included within the scope of other Standards (for example, the costs of producing tangible units would accumulate as inventory, and the entity would select an appropriate method of measuring that inventory).
In those cases, the boards decided that an entity should not account for the learning curve differently depending on whether or not a contract exists.
The boards decided that those interdependencies are best reflected by accounting and presenting on a net basis the remaining rights and obligations in the statement of financial position.
The boards observed that in the event of a breach of contract, some contracts require the entity and the customer to perform as specified in the contract.
Specific performance contracts are akin to financial contracts that are settled by physical delivery rather than by a net cash payment and for which the units of account are the individual assets and liabilities arising from the contractual rights and obligations.
BC319 However, the boards decided against making an exception for specific performance contracts. This is because the remedy of specific performance is relatively rare and is not available in all jurisdictions.
Instead, an entity should apply the general principles for the presentation of financial statements to determine whether to present contract assets and contract liabilities separately in the statement of financial position.
Because that additional detail is often useful to users of those financial statements, the boards decided that an entity could use different descriptions of contract assets, contract liabilities and receivables, and could use additional line items to present those assets and liabilities if the entity also provides sufficient information for users of financial statements to be able to distinguish them.
BC323 In many cases, that contract asset is an unconditional right to consideration — a receivable — because only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due.
The boards noted that making the distinction between a contract asset and a receivable is important because doing so provides users of financial statements with relevant information about the risks associated with the entity's rights in a contract.
That is because although both would be subject to credit risk, a contract asset is also subject to other risks, for example, performance risk.
Issues such as the measurement (or impairment) of receivables and disclosures relating to those assets are already addressed in IFRS and US GAAP.
For example, a payment for goods or services is typically due and an invoice is issued when the entity has transferred the goods or services to the customer.
However, the act of invoicing the customer for payment does not indicate whether the entity has an unconditional right to consideration.
In other cases, an entity can have an unconditional right to consideration before it has satisfied a performance obligation.
In those cases, on the date when payment is due, the entity has an unconditional right to consideration.
In those cases, the possible obligation to refund consideration in the future will not affect the entity's present right to be entitled to the gross amount of consideration.
In those cases, the boards observed that an entity may recognise a receivable and a refund liability (for example, when a right of return exists).
Broadly, regulators and users of financial statements found the disclosure requirements to be inadequate and lacking cohesion with the disclosure of other items in the financial statements.
This lack of cohesion made it difficult to understand an entity's revenues, as well as the judgements and estimates made by the entity in recognising those revenues.
For example, many users of financial statements observed that entities presented revenue in isolation, with the result that users of financial statements could not relate revenue to the entity's financial position.
Many respondents broadly supported that goal.
The objective of those workshops was to discuss issues on disclosure and transition and to identify potential solutions to address both users' needs for useful information and preparers' concerns about the costs of providing that information.
Those refinements and the reasons for the boards' decisions are explained in paragraphs BC330–BC361.
Some may observe that the overall volume of disclosure has increased compared with previous revenue disclosure requirements.
However, the boards observed that, to some extent, concerns about the increased volume were the inevitable consequence of addressing the shortcoming in the previous disclosure requirements.
In addition, the boards noted that many entities provide voluntary revenue disclosures outside the financial statements and the boards concluded that the increase in disclosure is necessary to improve previous disclosure practices and the usefulness of financial reporting.
BC331 The boards also decided to include disclosure requirements to help an entity meet the disclosure objective.
However, those disclosures should not be viewed as a checklist of minimum disclosures, because some disclosures may be relevant for some entities or industries but may be irrelevant for others.
The boards also observed that it is important for an entity to consider the disclosures together with the disclosure objective and materiality.
The FASB noted that in the absence of a general financial statement presentation standard, it would require an entity to present or disclose the amount of revenue recognised from contracts with customers.
The boards made this decision as a consequence of their previous decisions not to reflect customer credit risk in the measurement of the transaction price and, therefore, the amount of revenue recognised for transactions that do not include a significant financing component (see paragraphs BC259–BC265).
BC334 In the light of those decisions, the boards decided that separately disclosing (or presenting) the impairment losses on contracts with customers provides the most relevant information to users of financial statements.
This is because revenue can arise from the transfer of different goods or services and from contracts that involve different types of customers or markets.
Users of financial statements explained that understanding those differences was critical to their analyses.
Consequently, the boards decided to require an entity to provide disaggregated revenue information to help users of financial statements understand the composition of the revenue from contracts with customers recognised in the current period.
BC336 In developing the requirements for disclosing disaggregated revenue, the boards observed that some previous revenue recognition requirements required revenue to be disaggregated into its significant categories, including revenue arising from goods or services.
The boards noted that specifying an objective will result in the most useful information for users of financial statements, because it enables an entity to disaggregate revenue into categories that are meaningful for its business.
In addition, specifying an objective should result in disaggregation that is neither too aggregated nor too detailed.
The application guidance explains that the most appropriate categories depend on facts and circumstances; however, an entity should consider how revenue is disaggregated in other communications or for the purposes of evaluating financial performance.
The application guidance also includes a list of examples of categories (for example, geographical region or product type) by which an entity might disaggregate its revenue.
The boards noted that the list of categories was compiled as examples that could be applied to many different entities, industries and contracts.
As a result, the list should not be viewed either as a checklist or as an exhaustive list.
The boards decided this because users of financial statements explained that it is critical to their analyses to understand not only the composition of revenue, but also how that revenue relates to other information provided in segment disclosures such as costs of goods sold, expenses and assets used.
Those requirements require an entity to disaggregate and disclose revenue for each operating segment (reconciled to total revenue).
In addition, those requirements also require an entity to disaggregate total revenue by products or services (or by groups of similar products or services) and geographical areas — if the entity's operating segments are not based on those factors.
Furthermore, the boards observed that segment information might be based on non-GAAP information (ie the revenue that is reported to the chief operating decision maker may be recognised and measured on a basis that is not in accordance with IFRS 15).
Those users of financial statements noted that even though many entities currently recognise working capital balances such as unbilled receivables and deferred revenue, previous revenue recognition requirements did not require adequate disclosure about the relationship between those balances and the amount of revenue recognised.
BC342 However, many preparers strongly opposed any requirements to reconcile the contract asset and the contract liability balances in a tabular format.
Those preparers noted that it would be costly to compile and present the information because it was not tracked.
Preparers also questioned the usefulness of this reconciliation to users of financial statements, because the information was not used by management.
In contrast, users of financial statements reiterated that some of the information in the reconciliation would be useful, including the information about contract liabilities, which would provide greater transparency about future revenues, which is critical to their analyses.
However, users of financial statements also acknowledged that the rigid format of the proposed reconciliation had limitations that would have reduced its usefulness.
This is because, for example, changes in contract assets and contract liabilities would have been disclosed on an aggregate basis (ie changes in contract assets would have been offset by changes in contract liabilities) and, therefore, the extent of the changes in contract balances (and the reasons for those changes) would have been obscured.
However, to limit the costs of providing that information, those preparers explained that they need greater flexibility in the format of this disclosure.
Users of financial statements emphasised that it was critical to them to have information on the movements in the contract balances presented separately because it would help them understand information about the following
the amount of the opening balance of the contract liability balance that will be recognised as revenue during the period; and
the amount of the opening balance of the contract asset that will be transferred to accounts receivable or collected in cash during the period.
They did this because many users of financial statements observed that information about contract balances would be particularly important for entities that enter into long-term contracts with customers or that carry significant contract liability balances for other reasons (for example, prepaid service contracts).
However, the boards rejected this alternative for the following reasons
it would have been difficult to clearly identify the types of contracts or industries for which a reconciliation would (or would not) provide useful information.
limiting the scope of the reconciliation would have added complexity.
This is because limiting the scope could have resulted in excluding some of an entity's contract assets and contract liabilities from the reconciliation and, therefore, additional information would have been required to relate the reconciled amounts of contract assets or contract liabilities to those recognised in the statement of financial position.
information on contract balances is useful for other contracts, in addition to long-term contracts, because, for example, there may be a number of contracts or businesses that have significant timing differences between payment and performance.
This approach balances the needs of users of financial statements with preparers' concerns because the qualitative and quantitative disclosures provide users of financial statements with the information they requested (ie information on when contract assets are typically transferred to accounts receivable or collected as cash and when contract liabilities are recognised as revenue).
In addition, the boards decided that those disclosures would be more cost-effective than a reconciliation.
The boards also observed that this approach would not result in a significant change for many entities that are already disclosing similar information.
For example, the boards observed that some long-term construction entities already disclosed information relating to balances similar to contract assets and contract liabilities — often referred to as 'due from customers' or 'unbilled accounts receivable' and 'due to customers' or 'deferred revenue'.
Disclosing those amounts provides relevant information about the timing of revenue recognition that was not a result of performance in the current period and thus provides useful information about the current period operating results and on predicting future revenues.
BC348 Many users of financial statements explained that information about the amount and timing of revenue that the entity expects to recognise from its existing contracts would be useful in their analyses of revenue.
They also explained that the information would be most useful for long-term contracts, because those contracts typically have the most significant amounts of unrecognised revenue.
The boards observed that by disclosing that information, an entity would provide users of the entity's financial statements with additional information about the following
the amount and expected timing of revenue to be recognised from the remaining performance obligations in existing contracts;
trends relating to the amount and expected timing of revenue to be recognised from the remaining performance obligations in existing contracts;
the effect of changes in judgements or circumstances on an entity's revenue.
Those respondents highlighted different reasons for their disagreement, as follows
the disclosure would be difficult and costly to prepare and audit because existing accounting systems are not designed to track and capture the required information, including the information on scheduling the timing of the satisfaction of those remaining performance obligations.
In addition, the disclosure may include less information than the entity previously included in its backlog disclosure because future and cancellable executory contracts are excluded from the scope of the disclosure.
the information appeared to be forward-looking in nature and thus should not be presented in the notes to the financial statements.
Nonetheless, the boards decided to address preparers' concerns about costs of preparation as follows
This is because users indicated that information for remaining performance obligations is most critical to their analyses when the contracts are long-term.
The boards provided practical expedients rather than specifically limiting the scope because some preparers commented that it would be easier for them to comply with the requirement from an accounting systems and processes perspective if they could choose to include all of their remaining performance obligations in the disclosure.
However, many respondents disagreed with that proposal on the basis that the rigid nature of the prescribed time bands would imply a degree of precision in the timing of revenue recognition that may not exist and, furthermore, would increase the costs of preparation.
BC353 Some users of financial statements also asked for more information to be provided about the relationship between the amounts disclosed as an entity's remaining performance obligations and the entity's contract liabilities.
Consequently, the boards decided that no further disclosures should be required.
However, users of financial statements suggested that in many cases, an entity provides a 'boilerplate' description of the accounting policy adopted without explaining how the accounting policy relates to the contracts that the entity enters into with customers.
This disclosure complements the accounting policy disclosure requirements in existing Standards by requiring an entity to provide more descriptive information about its performance obligations.
Because of the importance placed on revenue by users of financial statements, the boards decided to require specific disclosures about the estimates used and the judgements made in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition.
That information will help users of financial statements understand the types of costs that the entity has recognised as assets and how those assets are subsequently amortised or impaired.
In addition, most users agreed that the disclosure about the assets recognised from the costs to obtain or fulfil a contract did not need to be provided as a reconciliation to provide relevant information.
Consequently, the boards decided to require disclosure of only the most critical information about assets recognised from the costs to obtain or fulfil a contract.
They explained that requiring all of the quantitative disclosures in interim financial reports would be too burdensome and difficult to achieve in the short time frames required for interim reporting.
In contrast, users of financial statements had mixed views.
However, other users of financial statements explained that only the information about the disaggregation of revenue was critical to their interim analyses.
Those users of financial statements also explained that timeliness in interim reporting was critical and that a requirement to provide other interim disclosures might unnecessarily delay the issuance of interim financial reports.
The FASB noted that it is helpful to provide entities with certainty about the information that should be provided in interim financial reports.
The FASB also observed that this information is useful to users of financial statements in assessing an entity's current and future financial performance.
However, to be consistent with the objective of developing a single revenue recognition model, the boards did not provide requirements that would have applied only to specific industries (see paragraphs BC2–BC3).
Sale with a right of return (paragraphs B20–B27)
BC364 In relation to performance obligations to provide customers with goods, the boards decided that, in effect, an entity has made an uncertain number of sales.
Consequently, the boards decided that an entity should not recognise revenue for the sales that are expected to fail as a result of customers exercising their return rights.
Instead, the entity should recognise a liability for its obligation to refund amounts to customers.
Using those principles, an entity would recognise revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the right of return is subsequently resolved.
BC366 The boards considered whether to account for the return right service as a performance obligation, in addition to any refund liability that is recognised.
If an entity does not recognise a performance obligation for the return right service, it should recognise all of the revenue and margin in the contract once the customer obtains control of the good.
That outcome might not faithfully depict the entity's performance under the contract.
However, the boards noted that accounting for the return right service as a performance obligation, in addition to the refund liability, would typically require the entity to estimate the stand-alone selling price of that service.
Consequently, the boards decided that the return right service should not be accounted for as a performance obligation.
The boards decided that the right to recover the good should be recognised as an asset rather than offset against the refund liability.
The boards observed that recognising the asset separately from the refund liability provides greater transparency and ensures that the asset is considered for impairment testing.
The warranty might be described as, for example, a manufacturer's warranty, a standard warranty or an extended warranty.
BC369 In the Discussion Paper, the boards proposed accounting for all warranties consistently because a unifying feature of all warranties is that an entity promises to stand ready to replace or repair the product in accordance with the terms and conditions of the warranty.
The Discussion Paper proposed that a promise to stand ready would provide a customer with a service of warranty coverage, which would have been a performance obligation to which revenue would be attributed.
However, most respondents to the Discussion Paper stated that the accounting for warranties should reflect the fact that some product warranties are different from others.
Some warranties protect the customer from defects that exist when the product is transferred to the customer and other warranties protect the customer from faults that arise after the product has been transferred to the customer.
Those respondents commented that the customer does not receive a separate service if the warranty only protects the customer from the product defects that were present at the time of sale.
The boards considered distinguishing warranties on the basis of when the fault in the products arises; however, respondents explained that such a distinction was not operational.
Therefore, the boards decided to distinguish warranties on the basis of whether the warranty provides the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the related product complies with the agreed-upon specifications.
Specifically, the boards decided that when the warranty provides a service (ie a service-type warranty), the warranty should be accounted for as a performance obligation.
Warranties that are performance obligations (service-type warranties)
That fact provides objective evidence that the promised warranty provides a service to the customer in addition to the promised product.
The boards noted the following about this decision
it provides a clear principle that allows an entity to account for economically similar warranties in a similar manner, regardless of whether the warranties are separately priced or negotiated;
it is consistent with the general principles for identifying performance obligations; and
it removes the bright line in previous US GAAP that distinguishes between different types of warranties based solely on whether the warranty is separately priced.
Warranties that are not performance obligations (assurance-type warranties)
BC374 The boards considered whether an assurance-type warranty should be accounted for as either of the following
a separate liability to replace or repair a defective product; or
an unsatisfied performance obligation, because the entity has not provided the customer with a product that is free from defects at the time of sale.
However, the boards decided not to retain that proposal, mainly for the following practical reasons
there would have been complexities associated with the requirements for an entity to continue to recognise as 'inventory' products that had been delivered to customers and that were expected to be defective; and
any margin attributable to the repair or replacement of a product in an assurance-type warranty would have been unlikely to significantly distort the pattern of recognition of the overall contract margin.
BC376 Accordingly, the boards decided that an entity should recognise an assurance-type warranty as a separate liability to replace or repair a defective product.
In contrast to the accounting for service-type warranties, an entity should not attribute any of the transaction price (and therefore revenue) to an assurance-type warranty.
The law might state that an entity is required to repair or replace products that develop faults within a specified period from the time of sale.
Consequently, those statutory warranties may appear to be service-type warranties because they cover faults arising after the time of sale, not merely defects existing at the time of sale.
However, the boards decided that the law can be viewed as simply operationalising an assurance-type warranty.
In other words, the objective of those statutory warranties is to protect the customer against the risk of purchasing a defective product.
But rather than requiring the entity to determine whether the product was defective at the time of sale, the law presumes that if a fault arises within a specified period (which can vary depending on the nature of the product), the product was defective at the time of sale.
Consequently, these statutory warranties should be accounted for as assurance-type warranties.
The boards noted that an entity should not recognise a performance obligation arising from those laws because the performance obligation in a contract is to transfer the product to the customer.
Any obligation of the entity to pay compensation for the damage or harm that its product causes is separate from the performance obligation.
Principal versus agent considerations (paragraphs B34–B38)
BC379 Previous revenue Standards required an entity to assess whether it was acting as a principal or an agent when goods or services were transferred to a customer.
That assessment was necessary to determine whether an entity should recognise revenue for the gross amount of customer consideration (if the entity was determined to be a principal) or for a net amount after the supplier was compensated for its goods or services (if the entity was determined to be an agent).
A principal controls the goods or services before they are transferred to a customer.
Consequently, the principal's performance obligation is to transfer those goods or services to the customer.
Therefore, recognising revenue at the gross amount of the customer consideration faithfully depicts the consideration to which the entity is entitled for the transfer of the goods and services.
In contrast, an agent does not control the goods or services before they are transferred to a customer.
The agent merely facilitates the sale of goods or services between a principal and the customer.
Consequently, an agent's performance obligation is to arrange for another party to provide the goods or services to the customer.
Therefore, the transaction price attributable to an agent's performance obligation is the fee or commission that the agent receives for providing those services.
This is because identifying the nature of the entity's performance obligation is necessary for the entity to determine whether it controls the goods or services that have been promised before they are transferred to a customer.
For example, a travel agent could be the principal in some contracts with customers if the travel agent determines that its promise is to provide a right to a flight (ie a ticket), instead of a promise to provide the flight.
However, to conclude whether they are a principal or an agent, the travel agent would need to also consider whether it controlled that right before transferring it to the customer, which may occur when the travel agent purchases the tickets in advance for sales to future customers.
Those indicators are based on indicators that were included in previous revenue recognition requirements in IFRS and US GAAP.
The boards observed that in some contracts in which the entity is the agent, control of the goods or services promised to the customer might transfer before the customer receives the goods or services from the principal.
the points entitle the customers to future discounted purchases with another party (ie the points represent a material right to a future discount); and
the entity determines that it is an agent (ie its promise is to arrange for the customers to be provided with points) and the entity does not control those points before they are transferred to the customer.
BC384 In contrast, the boards observed that if the points entitle the customers to future goods or services to be provided by the entity, the entity may conclude it is not an agent.
This is because the entity's promise is to provide those future goods or services and thus the entity controls both the points and the future goods or services before they are transferred to the customer.
In these cases, the entity's performance obligation may only be satisfied when the future goods or services are provided.
BC385 In other cases, the points may entitle customers to choose between future goods or services provided by either the entity or another party.
The boards observed that in those cases, to determine when the performance obligation is satisfied, the entity would need to consider the nature of its performance obligation.
Thus, the entity may not satisfy its performance obligation until such time as it either delivers the goods or services or is no longer obliged to stand ready.
The boards noted that this is consistent with previous revenue recognition requirements in IFRS for customer loyalty programmes.
Some stakeholders asked whether control is always the basis for determining whether an entity is a principal or an agent, and how the control principle and the indicators in paragraph B37 work together.
Other stakeholders asked how to apply the control principle to contracts involving intangible goods or services.
BC385B When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, the amendments to the application guidance clarify how an entity determines whether it is a principal or an agent.
The entity determines the nature of its promise on the basis of whether the entity controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer.
Throughout the guidance on principal versus agent considerations, the boards decided to refer to the specified good or service transferred to the customer (as in paragraph B34), rather than the performance obligation.
This is because use of the term 'performance obligation' would have been confusing if the entity is an agent.
An agent's performance obligation is to arrange for the other party to provide its goods or services to the customer; it does not promise to provide the goods or services itself to the end customer.
Accordingly, the specified good or service to be provided to the end customer is not the performance obligation of the agent.
Principle for determining whether an entity is a principal or an agent
BC385C Paragraph B34 requires an entity to determine whether it is a principal or an agent on the basis of whether the nature of the entity's promise is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods or services itself (ie the entity is a principal) or to arrange for those goods or services to be provided by another party (ie the entity is an agent).
Assessing whether the entity controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer is the basis for determining the nature of the entity's promise.
Such an entity does not need to evaluate whether it is a principal or an agent using the guidance in paragraphs B34–B38 because the entity transfers the good or provides the service directly to its customer, without the involvement of another party.
If the entity transfers a good or provides a service to an intermediary that is a principal in providing that good or service to an end customer (whether individually or as part of a distinct bundle of goods or services), the entity's customer is the intermediary.
the relationship between the control principle and the indicators in paragraph B37; and
the application of the control principle to intangible goods and services.
The relationship between control and the indicators in paragraph B37
In IFRS 15, the indicators support the concepts of identifying performance obligations and the transfer of control of goods or services.
BC385J The boards decided to amend the indicators in paragraph B37 to more clearly establish a link between the control principle and the indicators by
reframing the indicators as indicators of when an entity controls a specified good or service before transfer, rather than as indicators that an entity does not control the specified good or service before transfer.
removing the indicator relating to the form of the consideration.
Although that indicator might sometimes be helpful in assessing whether an entity is an agent, the boards concluded that it would not be helpful in assessing whether an entity is a principal.
removing the indicator relating to exposure to credit risk.
Stakeholders observed that the credit risk indicator in the previous revenue guidance has been problematic from the perspective of entities trying to use exposure to credit risk to override stronger evidence of agency.
BC385K In the light of the IASB's decision to generally apply a high hurdle when considering whether to amend IFRS 15, the IASB initially thought that it would not be necessary to add explanatory text to each indicator in paragraph B37 to establish a link to the concept of control.
In the IASB's view, clarity about the interaction between the control principle and the indicators could have been achieved by amending only the Illustrative Examples.
The IASB concluded that the benefits of retaining converged requirements on this topic outweigh the potential costs of amending the requirements.
In contrast, the indicators in paragraph B37 are intended to indicate whether the entity controls a specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer.
Application of the control principle to intangible goods and services
The boards observed that this also had frequently been a challenge for entities under previous revenue recognition Standards.
Appropriately identifying the good or service to be provided is a critical step in appropriately identifying whether the nature of an entity's promise is to act as a principal or an agent.
When the appropriate specified good or service is identified, the assessment of control is often relatively straightforward, even when the specified good or service is an intangible good or a service.
For example, the specified good or service to be provided to the customer could be
BC385O The boards observed that when the specified good or service to be provided to the customer is a right to goods or services to be provided in the future by another party, the entity would determine whether its performance obligation is a promise to provide a right to goods or services or whether it is arranging for the other party to provide that right.
The fact that the entity will not provide the goods or services itself is not determinative.
Instead, the entity evaluates whether it controls the right to goods or services before that right is transferred to the customer.
In doing so, it is often relevant to assess whether the right is created only when it is obtained by the customer, or whether the right to goods or services exists before the customer obtains the right.
If the right does not exist before the customer obtains it, an entity would be unable to control that right before it is transferred to the customer.
The boards observed that a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances, and exercise of judgement may be required in identifying the specified good or service (just as identifying an entity's performance obligations outside the context of a principal versus agent evaluation will often require judgement).
The boards also observed that assessing whether an entity controls a right to a good or service to be provided by another party is important to the principal versus agent evaluation.
If individual goods or services are not distinct from each other, then they may be, for example, merely inputs to a combined item and are each only part of a single promise to the customer.
Consequently, for contracts in which goods or services provided by another party are inputs to a combined item (or items) for which the customer has contracted, the entity assesses whether it controls the combined item before that item is transferred to the customer.
When the entity provides a significant integration service it controls the inputs to the combined item that is the specified good or service (including goods or services provided by another party that are inputs to the specified good or service).
The entity controls the inputs by directing their use to create the combined item.
In that case, the inputs provided by the other party would be a fulfilment cost to the entity.
BC385S Consequently, the boards decided to clarify the thought process to be applied when assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent by specifically requiring an entity to identify the specified good or service before applying the control principle to each specified good or service.
provide a better framework for assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent.
emphasise the importance of appropriately identifying the specified good or service (which could be a right to a good or service to be provided by another party) that will be transferred to the customer.
In its view, clarity about the thought process to be applied could have been achieved by amending only the Illustrative Examples.
Nonetheless, given the concerns raised by stakeholders, the IASB concluded that including paragraph B34A would be helpful to the principal versus agent evaluation, and would align the wording of the amendments with the wording of those made by the FASB.
Therefore, the IASB concluded that the benefits of adding the paragraph outweigh the potential costs of amending the requirements.
Assessment of control of a service
BC385U The TRG's discussions highlighted concerns about the application of the control principle to services to be provided to a customer.
Questions discussed included how an entity (other than the service provider) could control a service before that service is transferred to the customer, because a service comes into existence only at the moment that it is delivered.
The boards observed that an entity can control a service to be provided by another party when it controls the right to the specified service from the other party that will be provided to the customer.
Determining whether the entity controls a right to a specified service requires consideration of the facts and circumstances.
The boards noted that contracts involving services provided by another party in which the entity is a principal can be broadly categorised as follows
Paragraph B35A(c) states that this scenario would exist whenever the entity provides a significant service of integrating the service provided by another party into the specified good or service for which the customer has contracted.
In these contracts, the entity assesses whether it controls a right to the specified services.
An entity could control the right to the specified services by entering into a contract with the subcontractor and defining the services to be performed by the subcontractor on the entity's behalf.
In that scenario, which is illustrated in Example 46A, the entity obtains the right to the services of the subcontractor and then directs the subcontractor to provide the services to the customer on the entity's behalf.
This scenario is equivalent to the entity fulfilling the contract using its own resources rather than engaging another party to do so.
The entity would remain responsible for the satisfactory provision of services in accordance with the contract with the customer.
In other scenarios in which the specified services provided to the customer are provided by another party and the entity did not have the ability to direct those services, the entity would typically be an agent.
BC385W The boards noted that paragraph B35 explains that an entity that is a principal in a contract may satisfy a performance obligation by itself or it may engage another party to satisfy some or all of a performance obligation on its behalf.
Estimating revenue as a principal
BC385X Some TRG participants asked how an entity that is a principal would estimate the amount of revenue to recognise if it were not aware of the amounts being charged to end customers by an intermediary that is an agent.
The IASB concluded that the issue does not require any clarifications or additional guidance because the issue is expected to affect a limited number of entities and contracts.
For those limited situations, the FASB is of the view that the determination of whether revenue may be estimated is based on an assessment of the requirements for determining the transaction price and estimating variable consideration.
BC385Z The IASB did not specifically consider how the transaction price requirements would be applied in those situations but concluded that an entity that is a principal would generally be expected to be able to apply judgement and determine the consideration to which it is entitled using all relevant facts and circumstances available to it.
The boards considered when those options should be accounted for as a performance obligation.
During those discussions, the boards observed that it can be difficult to distinguish between the following
an option that the customer pays for (often implicitly) as part of an existing contract, which would be a performance obligation to which part of the transaction price is allocated; and
a marketing or promotional offer that the customer did not pay for and, although made at the time of entering into a contract, is not part of the contract and that would not be a performance obligation in that contract.
Previous US GAAP revenue recognition requirements for the software industry specified that an offer of a discount on future purchases of goods or services was presumed to be a separate option in the contract, if that discount was significant and also incremental both to the range of discounts reflected in the pricing of other elements in that contract and to the range of discounts typically given in comparable transactions.
Those notions of 'significant' and 'incremental' form the basis for the principle of a material right that is used to differentiate between an option and a marketing or promotional offer.
However, the boards observed that even if the offered discount is not incremental to other discounts in the contract, it nonetheless could, in some cases, give rise to a material right to the customer.
This often occurs in a credit card arrangement in which an entity provides the credit card holder with points based on the amount of purchases made at other entities (often referred to as 'merchants').
The boards determined that the assessment of whether any loyalty points represent a performance obligation requires an analysis of the facts and circumstances in each arrangement.
In some cases, the stand-alone selling price of the option may be directly observable.
In many cases though, the stand-alone selling price of the option will need to be estimated.
This measurement approach is consistent with the application guidance that was provided for measuring customer loyalty points in previous revenue recognition requirements in IFRS.
A renewal option could be viewed similarly to other options to provide additional goods or services.
In other words, the renewal option could be a performance obligation in the contract if it provides the customer with a material right that it otherwise could not obtain without entering into that contract.
BC392 However, there are typically a series of options in cases in which a renewal option provides a customer with a material right.
In other words, to exercise any option in the contract, the customer must have exercised all the previous options in the contract.
In other words, the entity would have had to consider the entire potential term of the contract to determine the amount of the transaction price from the initial period that should be deferred until later periods.
The practical alternative requires an entity to include the optional goods or services that it expects to provide (and corresponding expected customer consideration) in the initial measurement of the transaction price.
In the boards' view, it is simpler for an entity to view a contract with renewal options as a contract for its expected term (ie including the expected renewal periods) rather than as a contract with a series of options.
Consequently, it is more intuitive to view the goods or services underlying such options as part of the initial contract.
In contrast, customer loyalty points and many discount vouchers should be considered to be separate deliverables in the contract, because the underlying goods or services may be of a different nature.
That too is different from examples such as customer loyalty points and discount vouchers.
For example, if an airline offers flights to customers in exchange for points from its frequent flyer programme, the airline is not restricted, because it can subsequently determine the number of points that are required to be redeemed for any particular flight.
Similarly, when an entity grants discount vouchers, it has typically not restricted itself with respect to the price of the subsequent goods or services against which the discount vouchers will be redeemed.
Those requirements require the same pattern of revenue recognition as the requirements for customer options.
Thus, an entity should recognise revenue from breakage as it performs under the contract on the basis of the transfer of the goods or services promised in the contract.
This effectively increases the transaction price allocated to the individual goods or services transferred to the customer to include the revenue from the entity's estimate of unexercised rights.
The boards decided that this approach represents the most appropriate pattern of revenue recognition for breakage, because if an entity expected that customers would exercise all of their rights (ie if the entity did not expect any breakage), it might increase the price of its goods or services.
For example, an airline that sells non-refundable tickets would presumably charge a higher price per ticket if there was no expectation of breakage.
Otherwise, the entity's performance obligation to stand ready to provide future goods or services could be understated.
The boards decided that because the entity has not performed under the contract, recognising revenue would not have been a faithful depiction of the entity's performance and could also have understated its obligation to stand ready to provide future goods or services.
Therefore, those respondents were concerned that when the consideration is allocated between the option and another performance obligation, some of the breakage on the option would be recognised when the other performance obligation is satisfied, which could occur before any rights under the options are exercised by the customer.
This is because the boards' view at that time was that there is a point at which the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the right to use the intellectual property.
In the examples they considered, the boards observed that licences vary significantly and include a wide array of different features and economic characteristics, which lead to significant differences in the rights provided by a licence.
In some of the examples, the boards observed that the customer might be viewed as not obtaining control of the licence at a point in time.
This is because the intellectual property to which the customer has obtained rights is dynamic and will change as a result of the entity's continuing involvement in its intellectual property, including activities that affect that intellectual property.
In those cases, the customer may not be able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the licence at the time of transfer.
In other words, what the licence provides to the customer is access to the intellectual property in the form in which it exists at any given moment.
BC405 However, the boards observed that before applying the criteria, an entity should assess the goods or services promised in the contract and identify, as performance obligations, the promises that transfer the goods or services to the customer.
This would include an assessment of whether the customer can benefit from the licence on its own or together with other resources that are readily available (see paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15) and whether the licence is separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract (see paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15).
a licence that the customer can benefit from only in conjunction with a related service — this may occur when an entity provides a service, such as in some hosting or storage services, that enables the customer to use a licence, such as software, only by accessing the entity's infrastructure.
In addition, the use of the licence is highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with, the hosting service (see paragraph 29(c) of IFRS 15).
The entity would then determine when the single performance obligation is satisfied on the basis of when the good or service (ie the output) is transferred to the customer.
The boards noted that in some cases the combined good or service transferred to the customer may have a licence as its primary or dominant component.
Developing the criteria for licences that provide a right to access
If those criteria are not met, the licence provides the customer with a right to use an entity's intellectual property as that intellectual property exists (in the form and with the functionality) at the point in time when the licence transfers to the customer.
The activities may be part of an entity's ongoing and ordinary activities and customary business practices.
In those cases, the customer will essentially be using the most recent form of the intellectual property throughout the licence period.
The boards observed that when the activities do not affect the customer, the entity is merely changing its own asset, which, although it may affect the entity's ability to provide future licences, would not affect the determination of what the licence provides or what the customer controls.
This is because the nature and pattern of transfer of each (separate) performance obligation in a contract would not affect the timing of other promised goods or services in the contract and, thus, would not affect the identification of the rights provided by the licence.
This is because, by definition, a performance obligation is separate from the other promises in the contract.
In this case, it seems counterintuitive to include the promise to provide a (separate) maintenance service when determining the nature and timing of the entity's performance related to the transfer of the car.
A similar example can be drawn from a contract that includes a software licence and a promise to provide a service of updating the customer's software (sometimes included in a contract as post-contract support), in which the post-contract support is identified as a distinct good or service.
This is because the entity would not consider the post-contract support when determining when control of the software transfers to the customer.
For those reasons, the licence term does not depict when a customer obtains control of the promised licence.
In addition, respondents stated that a distinction based on exclusivity would not be operational, because it would require the boards to provide more clarity on how the term 'exclusive' would be interpreted.
Consequently, it would be difficult for an entity to determine how much of the intellectual property was consumed by a particular licence.
Instead, payment terms will be agreed by the customer and the entity and will reflect other economic factors such as credit risk and potential cash flows of the asset.
As a criterion for differentiating licences, this would have resulted in all of the promised consideration being recognised over time for such licences, including any fixed amount.
The boards decided not to include royalties as a criterion for differentiating licences, because the existence of a sales-based or a usage-based royalty does not solely define performance over time.
However, the boards observed that, in some cases, the existence of a sales-based or a usage-based royalty can indicate a 'shared economic interest' between the entity and the customer in the intellectual property being licensed and therefore the customer could reasonably expect that the entity will undertake activities that affect the intellectual property to which the licence relates.
The boards also decided, however, to include an exception for the revenue recognition pattern of sales-based or usage-based royalties (see paragraphs BC415–BC421).
When is the performance obligation satisfied?
However, when the licence provides the customer with a right to use the entity's intellectual property, the boards decided that the performance obligation will be satisfied at a point in time.
The boards also decided to specify that control of a licence could not transfer before the beginning of the period during which the customer can use and benefit from the licenced property.
If the customer cannot use and benefit from the licenced property then, by definition, it does not control the licence.
The boards noted that when viewed from the entity's perspective, performance may appear to be complete when a licence has been provided to the customer, even if the customer cannot yet use that licence.
The main issues discussed related to
determining the nature of the entity's promise in granting a licence of intellectual property;
the scope and applicability of the sales-based and usage-based royalties exception;
the effect of contractual restrictions in a licence on identifying the performance obligations in the contract; and
when the guidance on determining the nature of the entity's promise in granting a licence applies.
BC414B In the light of those discussions and the feedback received, the IASB decided to clarify the application guidance on licensing and the accompanying Illustrative Examples to improve its operability and understandability.
Except for the scope and applicability of the sales-based and usage-based royalties exception, the FASB reached different conclusions about whether and how to address stakeholder concerns.
Determining the nature of the entity's promise in granting a licence of intellectual property
A customer can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the benefits from, the intellectual property, if the intellectual property to which the customer has rights is not significantly affected by activities of the entity.
In contrast, a customer cannot direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, a licence at the point in time at which the licence is granted if the intellectual property to which the customer has rights changes throughout the licence period.
The intellectual property will change when the entity continues to be involved with its intellectual property and undertakes activities that significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights.
Paragraph B58 provides criteria to help an entity assess whether its activities 'change' the intellectual property to which the customer has rights, including whether the expected activities of the entity significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights.
BC414E Stakeholders agree that activities that change the form or functionality of the intellectual property would represent activities that affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights.
This had resulted in different interpretations about how to apply the criteria in paragraph B58(a).
Some stakeholders held the view that, for activities to significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights, those activities must be expected to change the form or functionality of that intellectual property.
They thought that changes that solely affect the value of the intellectual property do not significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights.
Others thought that activities that significantly affect the value of the intellectual property are sufficient to conclude that the licence provides a right to access the intellectual property.
BC414F The IASB decided to clarify the requirements of paragraph B58(a) by providing additional application guidance on when activities change the intellectual property to which the customer has rights in such a way that the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual property is significantly affected.
The IASB noted that the reference to form or functionality in paragraph B61 (and the Illustrative Examples and the Basis for Conclusions) was not intended to suggest that the nature of a licence is a right to access intellectual property only if the entity's activities significantly affect the form or functionality of the intellectual property to which the customer has rights.
Determining the nature of a licence is defined by the criteria in paragraph B58, which do not refer to form or functionality.
In some cases, the ability of the intellectual property to provide benefit to the customer is derived from the form or functionality of the intellectual property to which the customer has rights and, in other cases, from the value of that intellectual property.
If the activities are expected to significantly change the form or functionality of the intellectual property, those activities are considered to significantly affect the customer's ability to obtain benefit from the intellectual property.
If the activities do not significantly change the form or functionality, but the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual property is substantially derived from, or dependent upon, the entity's activities after the licence is granted, then the activities are also considered to significantly affect the intellectual property (as long as those activities do not result in the transfer of a good or service to the customer).
In these cases, it is not necessary for those activities to change the form or functionality of the intellectual property to significantly affect the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual property.
For example, in some circumstances (eg many licences of brands), the benefit of the intellectual property is derived from its value and the entity's activities to support or maintain that value.
BC414H The IASB observed that intellectual property that has significant stand-alone functionality derives a substantial portion of its benefit from that functionality.
Consequently, if the entity's activities do not significantly change the form or functionality of such intellectual property, then the entity's activities will not significantly affect the customer's ability to derive benefit from that intellectual property.
Therefore, the IASB clarified that in these cases the criterion in paragraph B58(a) would not be met and the licence would be a right to use the intellectual property as it existed at the time that it was transferred.
BC414I The IASB has not defined the term 'significant stand-alone functionality' but has made clarifications to the Illustrative Examples to illustrate when the intellectual property to which the customer has rights might have significant stand-alone functionality.
In many cases, it will be clear when intellectual property has significant stand-alone functionality.
If there is no significant stand-alone functionality, the benefit to the customer might be derived substantially from the value of the intellectual property and the entity's activities to support or maintain that value.
The IASB noted, however, that an entity may need to apply judgement to determine whether the intellectual property to which the customer has rights has significant stand-alone functionality.
The IASB is of the view that the addition of paragraph B59A provides clarity about the intended meaning of change in intellectual property, which makes the discussion in paragraph B57 redundant within the context of the application guidance.
The discussion in paragraph B57 explained the IASB's logic for the requirements for determining whether an entity's promise to grant a licence provides a customer with either a right to access or a right to use an entity's intellectual property.
Accordingly, the IASB has incorporated the content of paragraph B57 into this Basis for Conclusions.
The IASB is of the view that stakeholder concerns have been addressed adequately by providing greater clarity about how to apply the requirements within the Standard.
Alternative approach developed by the FASB
BC414L The FASB developed an alternative approach to determine whether a licence constitutes a right to access or a right to use, based on the nature of the intellectual property.
The FASB explained that the basis for this approach is whether an entity's promise to a customer includes supporting or maintaining the intellectual property to which the customer has rights, which in turn largely depends on whether the intellectual property has significant stand-alone functionality.
BC414M The FASB decided that intellectual property is either
In this case, a customer generally obtains a licence for the right to use intellectual property unless the functionality of the intellectual property is expected to substantively change during the licence period as a result of activities of the entity that do not transfer a good or service to the customer and the customer is contractually or practically required to use the updated intellectual property; or
symbolic intellectual property, which is intellectual property that does not have significant stand-alone functionality.
Substantially all of the utility of symbolic intellectual property is derived from its association with the entity's past or ongoing activities, including its ordinary business activities.
In this case, a customer obtains a licence for the right to access intellectual property.
The FASB's approach has the potential to result in some licences of symbolic intellectual property being classified as a right to access intellectual property, even though there is no expectation that the entity will undertake activities after making the intellectual property available to the customer.
For example, the entity may own a brand that it does not support or maintain, but still grants licences to customers to use the brand in television or movie productions that are set in a time period during which the brand was active.
Contractual restrictions in a licence and the identification of performance obligations
Those stakeholders acknowledged that paragraph B62 is clear that restrictions of time, geographical region or use do not affect the licensor's determination about whether the licence is satisfied over time or at a point in time.
This assessment is done before applying the criteria to determine the nature of an entity's promise in granting a licence.
In making this determination, judgement is needed to distinguish contractual provisions that create promises to transfer rights to use the entity's intellectual property from contractual provisions that establish when, where and how those rights may be used.
Similarly to the IASB, the FASB also observed that judgement is often required in distinguishing a contract that contains a single licence with multiple attributes from a contract that contains multiple licences to the customer that represent separate performance obligations.
Renewals of licences of intellectual property
Some stakeholders asked whether paragraph B61 applies to the renewal of an existing licence or whether the entity could recognise revenue for the renewal when the parties agree to the renewal.
This is because when the entity and the customer enter into a contract to renew (or extend the period of) an existing licence, the entity will evaluate whether the renewal or extension should be treated as a new licence or, alternatively, as a modification of the existing contract.
When to consider the nature of the entity's promise in granting a licence
Some held the view that paragraph B55 suggests that an entity would consider the nature of its promise in granting a licence only when the licence is distinct.
An entity will, however, need to apply judgement to determine the nature of the performance obligation, and to select a method of measuring progress that is consistent with the objective of depicting the entity's performance.
In some cases, it might be necessary for an entity to consider the nature of its promise in granting a licence even when the licence is not distinct.
Consideration in the form of sales-based or usage-based royalties
The boards observed that this would not result in relevant information, particularly in contracts in which the sales-based or usage-based royalty is paid over a long period of time.
Some respondents questioned the conceptual rationale for including a restriction that could in some cases result in an outcome that was not consistent with the requirement to recognise some or all of an estimate of variable consideration.
Others asked whether they could apply the restriction by analogy if the promised good or service had characteristics similar to a licence of intellectual property and the consideration depended on the customer's future actions.
Consequently, the boards considered whether they should do either of the following
develop a general principle that could be applied to all contracts that would achieve broadly the same outcomes.
It would have required the boards to create another exception to maintain the requirements for accounting for customer rights of return, which also results in consideration that is dependent on the customer's future actions.
Specifically, if the performance obligation to which the variable consideration related was satisfied at a point in time, an entity would include an estimate of variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
Conversely, if the performance obligation to which the variable consideration related was satisfied over time, an entity could include any estimate in the transaction price (even a minimum amount) provided that the objective of constraining estimates of variable consideration could be met.
However, the boards rejected this approach because it would have added complexity to the model that would outweigh the benefit.
The boards also noted that because this is a specific requirement intended for only limited circumstances, entities should not apply it by analogy to other types of promised goods or services or other types of variable consideration.
This guidance in paragraph B63 is referred to as the 'royalties constraint'.
BC421B Stakeholders had indicated that it was unclear when a sales-based or usage-based royalty is 'promised in exchange for a licence'.
Some stakeholders held the view that the royalties constraint applies whenever the royalty relates to a licence of intellectual property, regardless of whether the royalty is also consideration for other goods or services in the contract.
Stakeholders had also indicated that it was unclear whether a single sales-based or usage-based royalty should be split into a portion to which the royalties constraint would apply and a portion to which it would not, for example, when the royalty relates to a licence and another good or service that is not a licence.
BC421C In response to stakeholder concerns, the boards decided to clarify the application of the royalties constraint as follows
the royalties constraint applies whenever a licence of intellectual property is the sole or predominant item to which the royalty relates; and
BC421D The boards decided to clarify in paragraph B63A that the royalties constraint applies to those arrangements for which the licence is the predominant item to which the royalty relates.
This is because users of financial statements are likely to view those arrangements as licensing arrangements.
The boards had previously observed in paragraph BC415 that it would not be useful for an entity to recognise a minimum amount of revenue for licences of intellectual property for which the consideration is based on the customer's sales or usage.
However, the judgement needed for that determination is likely to be less than the judgement needed to apply the general requirements on variable consideration to those arrangements that would fall outside the scope of the royalties constraint if that scope were to be more restrictive.
BC421F The boards decided against changing the scope of the royalties constraint, including expanding it beyond those situations for which a licence is the predominant item to which a royalty relates.
This is because doing so would capture arrangements for which the boards previously concluded that the royalties constraint should not apply (for example, sales of intellectual property or sales of tangible goods that include intellectual property).
As noted in paragraphs BC416 and BC421, the royalties constraint is intended to apply only to limited circumstances involving licences of intellectual property and, therefore, entities cannot apply it by analogy to other types of transactions.
BC421H The boards made consistent clarifying amendments to the Illustrative Examples to more clearly support the conclusions reached about when a sales-based royalty would be recognised.
However, the boards decided not to amend paragraph B63 or provide further Illustrative Examples for more complex fact patterns.
If the entity has satisfied (or partially satisfied) the performance obligation to which the royalty relates, paragraph B63(a) further constrains the recognition of revenue until the uncertainty about the amount of revenue is resolved.
Consequently, an entity recognises revenue from a sales-based or usage-based royalty when (or as) the customer's subsequent sales or usage occur, unless recognition in that manner would accelerate the recognition of revenue for the performance obligation to which the royalty solely or partially relates ahead of the entity's performance towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation based on an appropriate measure of progress.
This is because splitting a royalty would result in an entity recognising an amount at contract inception that would reflect neither the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled based on its performance, nor the amount to which the entity has become legally entitled during the period.
BC422 When developing the requirements for control, the boards considered how an entity should apply the requirements to contracts in which the entity sells an asset and also enters into a repurchase agreement (either in the same contract or in another contract).
This is because the entity's subsequent decision to repurchase a good without reference to any pre-existing contractual right does not affect the customer's ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good upon initial transfer.
In other words, the customer is not obliged to resell that good to the entity as a result of the initial contract.
This is because the customer is constrained in its ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset.
Because the customer is obliged to return, or to stand ready to return, the asset to the entity, the customer cannot use up or consume the entire asset.
Moreover, the customer cannot sell the asset to another party (unless that sale is subject to a repurchase agreement, in which case the customer's benefit from the sale is constrained).
BC425 Theoretically, a customer is not constrained in its ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the benefits from, the asset if an entity agrees to repurchase, at the prevailing market price, an asset from the customer that is substantially the same and is readily available in the marketplace.
However, the boards noted that an entity would be unlikely to enter into such a transaction.
The FASB also decided to specify that when the forward or call option accounted for as a lease is part of a sale-leaseback transaction, the contract should be accounted for as a financing transaction.
Otherwise, the FASB observed that an entity would have been required to account for the transaction as a lease and then as a leaseback, which would not have been appropriate.
However, the boards observed that if the call option is non-substantive, that option should be ignored in assessing whether and when the customer obtains control of a good or service (to be consistent with the general requirement for any non-substantive term in a contract).
BC428 The boards decided that if the sale and repurchase agreement resulted in an entity's obligation to repurchase the asset at a customer's request (ie a put option), the customer would obtain control of the asset because the customer is neither obliged to return the asset nor obliged to stand ready to do so.
Consequently, the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset (ie the customer can sell, use up or consume the entire asset and choose not to exercise the put option).
The boards decided that the entity should account for its obligation to stand ready to repurchase the asset, to be consistent with the accounting for the sale of a product with a right of return (see paragraphs BC363–BC367).
That results in the entity recognising the following
a liability for its obligation to repurchase the asset, measured at the amount of the consideration expected to be paid to the customer;
an asset for the entity's right to receive that asset upon settling that liability, measured at an amount that may or may not equal the entity's previous carrying value of the asset; and
revenue on transfer of the asset for the difference between the sales price of the asset and the liability recognised for the obligation to repurchase the asset.
For instance, some noted that the contract appears to be economically similar to a lease with a purchase option rather than to a right of return.
That might be the case if the entity is required to repurchase the asset at a price that is lower than the original sales price and the surrounding facts and circumstances indicate that the customer will exercise its put option.
In those cases, the difference between the original sales price and the repurchase price can be viewed as the amount that the customer pays for a right to use the asset, thereby compensating the entity for the decline in the value of the asset.
Some respondents noted that, in other cases, the contract is, in effect, a financing arrangement.
BC430 The boards agreed with those respondents and decided that if a customer has a right to require an entity to repurchase the asset at a price that is lower than the original sales price and the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right, then the customer does not obtain control of the asset.
Although the customer is not obliged to exercise its put option, the fact that it has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right means that it would probably incur a loss if it did not do so.
(For example, the repurchase price may be set significantly above the expected market value of the asset at the date of the repurchase.
For similar reasons, the boards decided that if the customer has the unconditional right to require the entity to repurchase the asset at a price that is greater than the original sales price, and higher than the expected market value of the asset, the customer does not obtain control of the asset.
Accounting for those transactions as leases would be consistent with previous US GAAP, and a number of respondents, primarily from the automotive industry, explained that they viewed the transactions to be economically similar.
However, the boards observed that while the cash flows may be similar, the customer's ability to control the asset in each case is different.
If the customer has a put option that it has significant economic incentive to exercise, the customer is restricted in its ability to consume, modify or sell the asset.
However, when the entity guarantees that the customer will receive a minimum amount of sales proceeds, the customer is not constrained in its ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the asset.
Thus, the boards decided that it was not necessary to expand the requirements for repurchase agreements to consider guaranteed amounts of resale.
Accounting for repurchase agreements in which the customer does not obtain control of the asset
Consequently, the FASB decided to amend the guidance in Subtopic 470-40 that discusses arrangements in which an entity sells a product to another entity and, in a related transaction, agrees to repurchase the product.
However, the FASB decided not to amend Subtopic 470-40 for transactions in which an entity arranges for another party to purchase products on its behalf and agrees to purchase those products from the other party.
In those cases, the entity is required to recognise the products as an asset and to recognise a related liability when the other party purchases the product.
Transition, effective date and early application (paragraph C1–C9)
Retrospective application ensures that all contracts with customers are recognised and measured consistently both in the current period and in the comparative periods presented, regardless of whether those contracts were entered into before or after the requirements became effective.
Furthermore, retrospective application provides users of financial statements with useful trend information across the current period and comparative periods.
Feedback received from users of financial statements confirmed that retrospective application would be the most useful transition approach for them to be able to understand trends in revenue.
The main concerns raised by those respondents were as follows
it may not be possible to obtain historical information for contracts that were completed under previous revenue Standards in IFRS or US GAAP because the relevant information is no longer retained by the entity.
the historical information needed to estimate stand-alone selling prices of goods or services in a contract with many performance obligations may not exist.
entities make assumptions and estimates throughout a contract's life, and it may not be possible to recreate the circumstances that apply historically without the use of hindsight.
Retrospective application with practical expedients (paragraphs C4–C6)
Consequently, the boards considered how the burden of retrospective application could be eased while, at the same time, retaining the benefits of comparability and consistency that retrospective application would provide.
Reducing the number of contracts that require restatement
The boards noted that this relief would significantly reduce the transition burden on entities that have a large number of short-term contracts.
A consequence of this relief is that revenue reported in interim periods before and after the effective date would not necessarily be accounted for on a comparable basis.
The boards expect that an entity would not elect to use this relief if it operates in an industry in which comparability across interim reporting periods is particularly important to users of financial statements.
Simplifying how an entity restates contracts with customers
By allowing an entity to use hindsight in estimating variable consideration, the boards decided that transition would be simplified for the following reasons
(a) it would reduce the amount of information that an entity would need to collect throughout the transition period; and
Simplifying retrospective application of other aspects of the requirements
Retrospective application with the cumulative effect recognised in the current period (paragraphs C7–C8)
In contrast, users of financial statements generally supported the requirements for retrospective application with practical expedients because it would provide them with useful information on transition and assist their financial statement analyses.
During those workshops, users of financial statements acknowledged that another transition method might be appropriate to ease the burden of transition; however, they emphasised their need for trend information, regardless of which method is used.
However, because the comparative information will not be restated under the cumulative catch-up transition method, the boards decided to require additional disclosures to help users of financial statements understand the effect on trend information.
Consequently, when an entity uses the cumulative catch-up transition method, it is required to disclose the following information for reporting periods that include the date of initial application
an explanation of the reasons for the significant changes in those financial statement line items.
However, the boards rejected this approach because prospective application would not result in consistent presentation of existing contracts and new contracts and thus would reduce comparability.
In addition, this approach would not provide useful trend information for users of financial statements until existing contracts have been fully satisfied after the date of initial application.
The IASB additionally decided to allow an entity using the transition method described in paragraph C3(a) not to restate completed contracts at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
The following paragraphs explain the boards' considerations in providing the additional practical expedients.
definition of and accounting for a completed contract.
Definition of and accounting for a completed contract
In addition, referring to the words 'transferred all of the goods or services' in the definition of a completed contract, they commented that
The IASB noted that paragraph BC441 refers to performance in accordance with previous revenue Standards.
Consequently, in many situations the term 'transferred' would mean 'delivered' within the context of contracts for the sale of goods and 'performed' within the context of contracts for rendering services and construction contracts.
In some situations, the entity would use judgement when determining whether it has transferred goods or services to the customer.
The entity would continue to account for the completed contracts in accordance with its accounting policies based on the previous revenue Standards.
When developing the transition method described in paragraph C3(b), the boards considered feedback from users of financial statements and decided to require an entity to provide additional disclosures to help users understand the effect of that transition method on trend information (see paragraphs BC442–BC443).
The IASB observed that as part of the disclosures required by paragraph C8 an entity could provide additional information about the amount of revenue recognised using previous revenue Standards, if the entity concludes that such information would be helpful to users.
In addition, when selecting a transition method, the IASB expects that an entity would consider whether the selected transition method provides useful information to users of its financial statements.
The FASB acknowledged that an entity would need to apply judgement in some cases to determine whether a contract is completed.
The boards acknowledged that this choice might result in a decrease in comparability between entities.
However, the boards observed that applying the transition method described in paragraph C3(b) to all contracts, including completed contracts, at the date of initial application could result in financial information that is more comparable with financial information provided by entities using the transition method described in paragraph C3(a).
Furthermore, the IASB observed that any decrease in comparability between entities because of the choice will be transitory.
some entities will find applying the transition method described in paragraph C3(b) to all contracts less complex operationally than continuing to account for completed contracts under previous revenue Standards and all other contracts under IFRS 15, or using the method described in paragraph C3(a).
BC445L The FASB observed that allowing the choice may help mitigate some of the unanticipated financial reporting consequences that some entities may experience as a result of its amendments to the definition of a completed contract.
The IASB acknowledged that the expedient could affect the comparability of financial information under the full retrospective method, but concluded that this would be outweighed by the benefit provided by the reduced transition costs.
The new practical expedient allows the entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all past contract modifications when identifying the performance obligations, and determining and allocating the transaction price, instead of accounting for the effects of each contract modification separately.
Under this approach, the amount of consideration allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligations would be the total consideration promised by the customer (including amounts already received) less any amounts already recognised as revenue under previous revenue Standards.
Effective date and early application (paragraphs C1–C1B)
The boards developed this approach in response to feedback obtained from interested parties through a number of activities, including
Some respondents further explained that because of the large volume of contracts in their businesses, it would be far more cost-effective to process the information on a real-time basis to ensure that the adjustments to the financial statements were being calculated during the transition period, rather than attempting to retrospectively calculate the adjustments at the date of initial application.
Although the effective dates are not identical, the boards noted that this difference has resulted from precedents in IFRS and US GAAP.
Furthermore, the difference is not significant and the boards did not expect that it would result in a difference in the way that an entity considers the effective date.
However, in this case, the boards decided that a delayed effective date is appropriate because of the unique attributes of IFRS 15, including the wide range of entities that will be affected and the potentially significant effect that a change in revenue recognition has on other financial statement line items.
The FASB also decided that this is appropriate because of the relatively long lead time that has been provided to entities.
For example, the requirements for determining whether a performance obligation is satisfied over time should address the current diversity in practice associated with the application of the interpretation of IFRS on the construction of real estate.
In the light of those proposed amendments, the IASB and the FASB each discussed whether to defer the effective date of the Standard.
BC453B The IASB observed that changing the effective date of a Standard shortly after its issuance creates uncertainty for stakeholders and has the potential to set a bad precedent.
The effective date is set after consideration of information obtained in the exposure process about the time needed to implement the requirements.
Accordingly, the IASB would consider changing the effective date only in exceptional circumstances.
In addition, the IASB observed that the proposed amendments noted in paragraph BC453A are expected to clarify, rather than change, the requirements of the Standard.
To attain that objective, the boards try to ensure that new requirements meet a significant need and that the overall benefits to economic decision-making that would result from improved financial reporting justify the costs of providing such information.
For example, the boards consider the comparative advantage that preparers have in developing information, compared with the costs that users of financial statements would incur to develop surrogate information.
In this evaluation, the boards recognise that the costs of implementing a new standard might not be borne evenly by participants in the financial reporting system.
However, both the users of financial statements and the entities that prepare those financial statements benefit from improvements in financial reporting that facilitate the functioning of markets for capital, including credit and the efficient allocation of resources in the economy.
Consequently, the IASB sees this analysis of the effects as being part of an evolving process.
In addition, the assessment undertaken is that of the likely effects of the new requirements because the actual effects would not be known until after the new requirements had been applied.
However, throughout the project, many preparers and some users of financial statements explained that they did not perceive significant weaknesses in previous revenue recognition requirements.
Therefore, those preparers and users questioned whether the benefits of applying a new revenue standard would justify the costs of implementing that standard.
Those meetings included general educational sessions about the proposals and in-depth discussions in relation to particular topics.
Some meetings also focused on gaining an understanding of the effects of the proposals in specific industries or on particular transactions.
In some cases, the boards undertook additional outreach in those specific industries or on those particular topics for which there were significant operational or other concerns about the effects of the boards' proposals.
In addition, because of the effect of the principles for allocating the transaction price on a typical mobile phone contract, the boards also held a number of meetings with representatives from the telecommunications industry to better understand their concerns and so that those concerns could be considered during redeliberations.
The boards' consideration of the feedback received from this industry and their conclusions is included in paragraphs BC287–BC293 and BC473–BC476.
Discussion of this feedback and the resulting changes in different aspects of the model are included throughout the Basis for Conclusions and are summarised in this analysis of the effects.
In making this assessment, the boards considered
how revenue from contracts with customers would be reported in the financial statements;
how the comparability of financial information would be improved and the benefit of better economic decision-making as a result of improved financial reporting;
the likely compliance costs for preparers of financial statements; and
the likely costs of analysis for users of financial statements.
This framework provides a basis that should be more easily applied to complex transactions and that provides timely guidance for evolving revenue transactions.
This is because the diversity in practice that developed as a result of weaknesses in previous revenue recognition requirements in IFRS and US GAAP would be eliminated.
For example, some industries, such as the telecommunications and software industries, may have significant changes.
This is because those industries had narrow and transaction-specific industry revenue recognition requirements in US GAAP (which were often referred to by entities applying IFRS).
However, other industries, such as the construction industry, may see minimal changes overall but significant changes for particular entities or jurisdictions that may have interpreted previous requirements differently to apply to their specific transactions.
BC463 In making their assessment of the nature of the changes in the reporting of revenue from contracts with customers (ie the recognition and measurement of revenue), the boards observed that the following parts of the revenue recognition model are expected to result in the most significant changes for some entities
transfer of control: basis for the timing of revenue recognition;
identification of performance obligations in a contract;
allocating the transaction price to performance obligations based on relative stand-alone selling prices; and
Transfer of control: basis for the timing of revenue recognition
BC464 Previous revenue recognition requirements typically determined the timing of revenue recognition depending on whether the asset transferred was a good or a service.
Both IFRS and US GAAP required revenue to be recognised for goods when risks and rewards transferred and, for services, as the service was performed.
However, both approaches presented challenges in determining when to recognise revenue and often resulted in accounting for economically similar transactions differently.
For example, when determining when to recognise revenue for the transfer of a good, it was often difficult for an entity to judge whether a preponderance (or some other balance) of the risks and rewards had been transferred to the customer.
Some of this difficulty was due to the vague and narrow definition of services in US GAAP and the lack of clear rationale (ie a Basis for Conclusions) in IFRS for why, in some cases, revenue should be recognised for a service over time.
In some cases, entities that applied IFRS consulted the rationale in US GAAP for why revenue would be recognised over time for a service.
That rationale explained that this was because the entity was transferring a service continuously.
However, that rationale did not address many specific application questions in IFRS about determining whether specific items met the definition of a service.
In response, the IASB developed an Interpretation to help clarify whether the construction of real estate would be accounted for as a good or a service (ie a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time or over time).
However, many observed that the principle in that Interpretation was difficult to understand and apply.
This is because the framework would be applied to the attributes of the goods and services transferred, together with the terms of the contract, rather than only to the type of contract.
In addition, the boards determined that the core principle in IFRS 15, based on the notion of transferring control, would further improve the consistency of reporting because it would provide a more objective assessment for determining the timing of revenue recognition.
However, those previous requirements were limited and industry-specific.
For example, in US GAAP, revenue recognition for licences differed depending on the industry (for example, franchisors, media and entertainment and software) and often was based on features of the licence (for example, licence period or payment terms).
Therefore, the previous revenue recognition requirements did not coalesce into a single principle or rule.
In IFRS, previous revenue recognition requirements for licences required revenue to be recognised 'in accordance with the substance of the agreement'.
However, because those requirements provided minimal guidance on how an entity should assess the 'substance of the agreement', there was significant diversity in practice for the accounting for licences.
The boards also decided to include in the application guidance the rationale for the guidance and additional illustrative examples to explain the intention, objective and application of those steps and the differentiation between licences.
However, the boards observed that the diversity and inconsistencies that previously existed meant that some changes in practice would have occurred regardless of how the boards decided to apply the revenue recognition model to licences.
Identification of performance obligations in a contract
Although US GAAP was improved after the Revenue Recognition project began, deficiencies still existed.
IFRS had even fewer requirements because it only acknowledged that revenue could be recognised for 'separately identifiable components of a single transaction', without providing guidance on how to determine what constituted a 'separately identifiable component'.
These requirements were developed on the basis of extensive consultation and attempts to separate contracts in a meaningful and cost-effective way with intuitive outcomes.
However, the boards observed that because there were specific requirements in previous US GAAP, there would be a change in the accounting for incidental obligations and marketing incentives (see paragraphs BC87–BC93).
Allocating the transaction price to performance obligations based on relative stand-alone selling prices
This was due in part to the lack of guidance on defining an element or unit of account for revenue.
In contrast, US GAAP specified that an allocation of the consideration to multiple-elements should be made on a relative selling price basis for some industries.
However, the allocation requirements in the software industry strictly prohibited allocation to individual elements unless the entity obtained vendor-specific objective evidence for all elements of the contract.
This is because the boards decided to eliminate the restrictive, industry-specific requirements in US GAAP for allocating consideration in software arrangements (ie the requirement to have vendor-specific objective evidence for all elements in the arrangements before consideration can be allocated).
The boards observed that this change would permit an entity in the software industry to better depict performance by recognising revenue for performance obligations when they are satisfied, instead of when all performance in a contract is complete.
In some instances, the boards observed that this may permit entities to eliminate the disclosure of non-GAAP measures that were created because the outcomes from applying previous revenue recognition requirements did not faithfully depict an entity's performance.
As explained in paragraph BC457, the boards' consideration of the feedback received from the telecommunications industry and their conclusions are included in paragraphs BC287–BC293.
In addition, the boards observed that the effects were a consequence of the boards' objectives of eliminating industry-specific requirements and defining a common framework that could be applied to all revenue transactions.
US GAAP did not provide specific requirements for how to measure revenue for goods, but it nevertheless restricted the amount of revenue that could be recognised for goods to the amount that was fixed or determinable.
Consequently, that principle was not consistently applied.
In addition, IFRS contained little guidance on how to measure variable consideration.
However, both IFRS and US GAAP indicated that the amount of revenue to be recognised for services should be limited to an amount that could be 'estimated reliably'.
However, previous practices were broadly consistent with this approach and many entities determined the amount of revenue on the basis of the amounts the customer promised to pay.
However, it may result in changes in the timing of revenue recognised in other cases, for which estimation of variable consideration was either prohibited or not used in the recognition of revenue.
For example, in some distribution channels, entities may not have estimated the price of a good or service when that price depended on the eventual sale to an end customer.
In those cases, revenue was not recognised until that final sale occurred.
The boards concluded that the additional guidance for estimation methods should ensure that performance is better reflected in the financial statements in those cases and should provide greater consistency in estimating variable consideration.
The additional guidance would also provide users of financial statements with more transparency on the estimation process, which was often masked with undefined terms such as 'best estimates'.
It would also give users of financial statements more confidence in the amount of revenue recognised in the financial statements by requiring a consistent approach to estimating the amount of variable consideration to which an entity is entitled.
The boards included the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration in part because of feedback from users of financial statements who demanded that estimates should be of high quality, but also because a significant portion of errors in financial statements have related to the overstatement of revenue.
BC481 Before the issuance of IFRS 15, there were significant differences in accounting for economically similar revenue transactions, both within and across industries for entities applying US GAAP.
There was also significant diversity in practice in accounting for revenue transactions for entities applying IFRS.
Those differences made it difficult for users of financial statements to understand and compare revenue numbers.
As explained in paragraphs BC460–BC480, some of this diversity arose because there were limited revenue recognition requirements in IFRS in general and on particular topics.
Those differences also arose because previous revenue recognition requirements in US GAAP were voluminous and often industry-specific or transaction-specific, which also created difficulty for users of financial statements in interpreting the information about revenue.
The boards noted that the diversity in practice and challenges to users were often amplified for entities applying IFRS because some preparers selectively referenced US GAAP.
Consequently, users of financial statements found it difficult to understand an entity's revenues, as well as the judgements and estimates made by that entity in recognising those revenues.
However, many entities acknowledged a need to provide investors with additional information about revenue and therefore provided this information in other reports outside the financial statements (for example, in earnings releases and shareholder reports).
In addition, the boards observed that a common revenue Standard should make the financial reporting of revenue comparable between entities that prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS or US GAAP, resulting in a significant benefit to users.
Furthermore, by providing a rationale for the requirements (ie a Basis for Conclusions), the framework should be more easily applied to a broad range of transactions and contracts.
Specifically, the information about revenue would enable users of financial statements to better understand an entity's contracts with customers and revenue from those contracts and to better predict cash flows.
This information should also help users of financial statements to make more informed economic decisions.
However, the boards concluded that these costs were necessary to improve the usefulness of financial reporting in an area that is critical for users of financial statements to the analysis and understanding of an entity's performance and prospects.
However, because the requirements adequately depict performance, the boards do not expect that these performance measures would be necessary in the longer term.
However, because of the breadth of industries and entities that will be affected, most entities will incur at least some costs.
Broadly, the boards expect that a majority of preparers may incur the following costs
costs to implement changes in or develop new systems, processes and controls used to gather and archive contract data, make required estimates and provide required disclosures, possibly including fees paid to external consultants;
costs required to educate users of financial statements about the effects on the financial statements.
increase in audit fees because of the increased volume of disclosures and the difficulty of auditing some of the required estimates (for example, estimates of stand-alone selling price and variable consideration);
costs to maintain improved systems and make modifications for transactions; and
Board members and staff consulted extensively across a wide range of industries and jurisdictions to better understand some of the operational issues arising from the proposals in the Discussion Paper and both Exposure Drafts.
The boards took that feedback into consideration in their redeliberations and, as a result, modified or clarified many aspects of the revenue recognition model to reduce the burden of implementing and applying the requirements.
Those decisions and their rationale are documented throughout the Basis for Conclusions in relation to specific aspects of the model such as variable consideration and significant financing components.
Those clarifications and modifications included
clarifying the use of portfolios — the boards clarified that many entities would not need to develop systems to account for each contract individually, especially entities that have a large volume of similar contracts with similar classes of customer.
In those cases, the boards noted that entities may apply the requirements to a portfolio of similar contracts.
Instead, the boards decided to require only the opening and closing balances as well as some information on the changes in those balances.
Therefore, to ease implementation costs and complexities associated with transition to IFRS 15, the boards decided to provide practical expedients that an entity may elect to use when applying the requirements retrospectively.
In addition, the boards introduced an alternative transition method (ie the cumulative catch-up transition method) that would alleviate the costs of transition for many entities because it would not require restatement of prior periods.
The boards concluded that this would help to reduce both the initial and ongoing cost of compliance, as well as enhancing the consistency of application and therefore comparability of financial statements.
Those costs may include costs to modify their processes and analyses.
However, the costs are likely to be non-recurring and are likely to be offset by a longer-term reduction in costs from the additional information that would be provided by the improved disclosure requirements.
Users of financial statements may also observe a longer-term reduction in education costs, because of the common framework created by IFRS 15, which applies across jurisdictions, industries and transactions.
greater comparability and consistency of reporting revenue from contracts with customers;
a better depiction of entities' performance; and
improved understanding of entities' contracts and revenue-generating activities.
will apply to a broad range of transactions and industries and will improve the comparability of the recognition of revenue across industries and jurisdictions;
can be applied to complex transactions and evolving transactions, resulting in greater consistency in the recognition of revenue; and
will require enhanced disclosures that will improve the understandability of revenue, which is a critical part of the analysis of an entity's performance and prospects.
The differences in their rationale are as follows
In addition, there were transactions that were not directly in the scope of specific guidance.
Consequently, economically similar transactions were often accounted for differently.
In particular, IFRS did not include general requirements related to many key issues in revenue recognition such as multiple-element arrangements and how to allocate consideration to those elements.
In addition, the lack of a Basis for Conclusions in those previous revenue recognition requirements in IFRS created challenges in assessing how to apply the principles in those requirements.
In combination, these factors contributed to diversity in practice across jurisdictions and industries.
Those requirements require an entity to determine whether the parties are committed to perform under the contract, which can be difficult in sales of real estate in which the seller has provided significant financing to the purchaser.
The changes to those Standards will result in the same accounting requirements under IFRS and US GAAP for the transfer of non-financial assets that are not an output of an entity's ordinary activities.
However, because the requirements in those Standards were previously different under IFRS and US GAAP, the boards have different reasons for making those changes.
Consequential amendments to US GAAP
The FASB noted that retaining those requirements could result in an entity recognising the profit or loss on a real estate sale differently, depending on whether the transaction is a contract with a customer.
However, there is economically little difference between the sale of real estate that is an output of the entity's ordinary activities and the sale of real estate that is not.
The primary reason for that decision was the lack of clear requirements in US GAAP for accounting for the transfer of non-financial assets when those assets are not an output of an entity's ordinary activities and do not constitute a business or non-profit activity.
However, the IASB noted that there is diversity in practice in the recognition of the gain or loss when the transfer of those assets involves variable consideration, because the previous revenue Standard in IFRS did not provide specific requirements for variable consideration.
measuring the gain on the transfers of non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity's ordinary activities by using the same requirements as for measuring revenue provides users of financial statements with useful information.
The IASB decided that it would provide useful information if entities apply the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration to any gain that will be recognised on the transfer of the non-financial asset.
The IASB acknowledged that in some cases this may result in a loss on the transfer when the transferred asset has a cost basis that is greater than the constrained consideration, which may occur when the asset has a cost basis that is determined using fair value.
However, the IASB noted that this outcome is appropriate and useful to users, because of the significant uncertainty about the variable consideration.
The IASB also noted that this outcome is consistent with the outcome in a transaction with a customer in which the variable consideration is constrained, but the entity has transferred control of the good or service to the customer.
it is not necessary to measure the gains on the transfers of non-financial assets to be consistent with other asset disposals, such as disposals of an entity, that are accounted for at fair value in accordance with other Standards (for example, IFRS 10).
This is because transfers of non-financial assets that are not an output of an entity's ordinary activities are more like transfers of assets to customers, rather than other asset disposals.
The boards noted that undertaking a separate project would mean that changes to existing Standards would not be made until that project had been completed and became effective.
The boards observed that the implications of not proceeding with the proposed consequential amendments would have been as follows
This would have resulted in different recognition and measurement requirements for transfers of non-financial assets as compared to contracts with customers.
This is identical to retrospective application for entities already applying IFRS.
Some IASB members also noted that in many jurisdictions that have not yet adopted IFRS, revenue standards are similar to current IFRS.
This would not only be challenging for preparers, but might also be confusing for users of financial statements.
allocation of a discount among performance obligations should be done before using the residual approach to estimate the stand-alone selling price for a good or service with a highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling price.
This determination will affect whether the entity satisfies its performance obligation to transfer a licence at a point in time or over time.
Specifically, it requires an entity to provide a combination of qualitative and quantitative information about contract balances.
For a contract to meet that criterion, an entity must conclude that it is probable that it will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.
In setting the threshold, the boards acknowledged that the term 'probable' has different meanings in IFRS and in US GAAP.
However, the boards decided to set the threshold at a level that is consistent with previous revenue recognition practices and requirements in IFRS and in US GAAP.
Entities that do not have public accountability may apply IFRS for Small and Medium-sized Entities.
The differences are as follows
The FASB also decided to specify that the constraint on variable consideration applies only to variability in the fair value of the non-cash consideration that arises for reasons other than the form of the consideration.
The FASB decided to amend the criteria to determine the nature of the licence by requiring an entity to classify the intellectual property underlying the licence as functional or symbolic based on whether the intellectual property has significant stand-alone functionality.
A licence to functional intellectual property is considered a right to use, while a licence to symbolic intellectual property is considered a right to access the underlying intellectual property.
The IASB did not make similar amendments.
The FASB decided not to provide the practical expedient.

Continuation of existing accounting policies
Classification of regulatory deferral account balances
Classification of movements in regulatory deferral account balances
Explanation of activities subject to rate regulation
identify and explain the amounts recognised in the entity's financial statements that arise from rate regulation; and
help users of the financial statements to understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows from any regulatory deferral account balances that are recognised.
recognised amounts that qualify as regulatory deferral account balances in its financial statements in accordance with its previous GAAP.
Recognition, measurement, impairment and derecognition
An entity may only change its accounting policies for the recognition, measurement, impairment and derecognition of regulatory deferral account balances if the change makes the financial statements more relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users and no less reliable
However, the change does not need to achieve full compliance with those criteria for the recognition, measurement, impairment and derecognition of regulatory deferral account balances.
In the absence of any such exception, exemption or additional requirements, other Standards shall apply to regulatory deferral account balances in the same way as they apply to assets, liabilities, income and expenses that are recognised in accordance with other Standards.
When this Standard is applied, the regulatory deferral account balances are recognised in the statement of financial position in addition to the assets and liabilities that are recognised in accordance with other Standards.
These presentation requirements separate the impact of recognising regulatory deferral account balances from the financial reporting requirements of other Standards.
the total of all regulatory deferral account debit balances; and
the total of all regulatory deferral account credit balances.
Separate line items shall be used for the net movement related to items that, in accordance with other Standards

the level of detail that is necessary to satisfy the disclosure requirements;
a brief description of the nature and extent of the rate-regulated activity and the nature of the regulatory rate-setting process;
how the future recovery of each class (ie each type of cost or income) of regulatory deferral account debit balance or reversal of each class of regulatory deferral account credit balance is affected by risks and uncertainty, for example
demand risk (for example, changes in consumer attitudes, the availability of alternative sources of supply or the level of competition);
regulatory risk (for example, the submission or approval of a rate-setting application or the entity's assessment of the expected future regulatory actions); and
If the information is not included in the financial statements directly or incorporated by cross-reference, the financial statements are incomplete.
a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and the end of the period, in a table unless another format is more appropriate.
the amounts that have been recognised in the current period in the statement of financial position as regulatory deferral account balances;
(iii) other amounts, separately identified, that affected the regulatory deferral account balances, such as impairments, items acquired or assumed in a business combination, items disposed of, or the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates or discount rates;
In addition, the entity shall separately disclose any regulatory deferral account balance that relates to taxation and the related movement in that balance.
An entity's activities that are subject to rate regulation.
An authorised body that is empowered by statute or regulation to establish the rate or a range of rates that bind an entity.
Historically, rate regulation applied to all activities of an entity.
However, with acquisitions, diversification and deregulation, rate regulation may now apply to only a portion of an entity's activities, resulting in it having both regulated and non-regulated activities.
This Standard applies only to the rate-regulated activities that are subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions through the actions of a rate regulator, regardless of the type of entity or the industry to which it belongs.
An entity shall not apply this Standard to activities that are self-regulated, ie activities that are not subject to a pricing framework that is overseen and/or approved by a rate regulator.
This does not prevent the entity from being eligible to apply this Standard when
the entity's own governing body or a related party establishes rates both in the interest of the customers and to ensure the overall financial viability of the entity within a specified pricing framework; and
Consequently, such an item is recognised as income or expense as incurred, unless another Standard permits or requires it to be included in the carrying amount of an asset or liability.
In some cases, other Standards explicitly prohibit an entity from recognising, in the statement of financial position, regulatory deferral account balances that might be recognised, either separately or included within other line items such as property, plant and equipment in accordance with previous GAAP accounting policies.
Such accounting policies may include, for example, the following practices
recognising, as a regulatory deferral account debit or credit balance, an amount that is equivalent to any loss or gain on the disposal or retirement of both items of property, plant and equipment and of intangible assets, which is expected to be recovered or reversed through future rates;
recognising a regulatory deferral account credit balance when the entity is required, as a result of the actual or expected actions of the rate regulator, to decrease rates in future periods in order to reverse over-recoveries of allowable costs (ie amounts in excess of the recoverable amount specified by the rate regulator); and
measuring regulatory deferral account balances on an undiscounted basis or on a discounted basis that uses an interest or discount rate specified by the rate regulator.
The following are examples of the types of costs that rate regulators might allow in rate-setting decisions and that an entity might, therefore, recognise in regulatory deferral account balances
volume or purchase price variances;
(iii) non-directly-attributable overhead costs that are treated as capital costs for rate regulation purposes (but are not permitted, in accordance with IAS 16, to be included in the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment);
(vi) deemed interest (including amounts allowed for funds that are used during construction that provide the entity with a return on the owner's equity capital as well as borrowings).
Regulatory deferral account balances usually represent timing differences between the recognition of items of income or expenses for regulatory purposes and the recognition of those items for financial reporting purposes.
An entity that is within the scope of, and that elects to apply, the requirements of this Standard shall continue to apply its previous GAAP accounting policies for the recognition, measurement, impairment and derecognition of regulatory deferral account balances.
An entity may need to use estimates and assumptions in the recognition and measurement of its regulatory deferral account balances.
In some rate-regulatory schemes, the rate regulator permits or requires an entity to increase its future rates in order to recover some or all of the entity's income tax expense.
The recognition of this regulatory deferral account balance that relates to income tax might itself create an additional temporary difference for which a further deferred tax amount would be recognised.
Notwithstanding the presentation and disclosure requirements of IAS 12, when an entity recognises a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability as a result of recognising regulatory deferral account balances, the entity shall not include that deferred tax amount within the total deferred tax asset (liability) balances.
Instead, the entity shall present the deferred tax asset (liability) that arises as a result of recognising regulatory deferral account balances either
with the line items that are presented for the regulatory deferral account debit balances and credit balances; or
as a separate line item alongside the related regulatory deferral account debit balances and credit balances.
Instead, the entity shall present the movement in the deferred tax asset (liability) that arises as a result of recognising regulatory deferral account balances either
For each earnings per share amount presented in accordance with IAS 33, an entity applying this Standard shall present additional basic and diluted earnings per share amounts that are calculated in the same way, except that those amounts shall exclude the net movement in the regulatory deferral account balances.
Paragraph B18 of this Standard provides an additional exception.
The acquiree's regulatory deferral account balances shall be recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the acquirer in accordance with the acquirer's policies, irrespective of whether the acquiree recognises those balances in its own financial statements.
within the line item that is presented for movements in the regulatory deferral account balances related to profit or loss; or
as a separate line item alongside the related line item that is presented for movements in the regulatory deferral account balances related to profit or loss.
Instead, the entity shall present the total of the regulatory deferral account debit balances and credit balances that are part of the disposal group either
within the line items that are presented for the regulatory deferral account debit balances and credit balances; or
as separate line items alongside the other regulatory deferral account debit balances and credit balances.
Consequently, if a parent recognises regulatory deferral account balances in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with this Standard, it shall apply the same accounting policies to the regulatory deferral account balances arising in all of its subsidiaries.
This shall apply irrespective of whether the subsidiaries recognise those balances in their own financial statements.
Consequently, adjustments shall be made to make the associate's or joint venture's accounting policies for the recognition, measurement, impairment and derecognition of regulatory deferral account balances conform to those of the investing entity in applying the equity method.
Outstanding ordinary shares that are contingently returnable (ie subject to recall) are not treated as outstanding and are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share until the date the shares are no longer subject to recall.
The requirements in paragraph B3.3.6A have not been amended but have been moved from paragraph B3.3.6.
In determining those fees paid net of fees received, a borrower includes only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf.
The requirements formerly in paragraph 74(d) have not been amended but have been moved to paragraph 74A(a).
Items may be produced while bringing an item of property, plant and equipment to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management (such as samples produced when testing whether the asset is functioning properly).
An entity recognises the proceeds from selling any such items, and the cost of those items, in profit or loss in accordance with applicable Standards.
the amount of contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.
If not presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income, the financial statements shall also disclose
An entity shall apply those amendments retrospectively, but only to items of property, plant and equipment that are brought to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which the entity first applies the amendments.
The entity shall recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at the beginning of that earliest period presented.
